# Gaiad Genealogy Project - Complete Summary

## Project Overview
The Gaiad Genealogy Project involves uploading and managing genealogical data from multiple sources into the Evolutionism Wikibase instance at evolutionism.miraheze.org. This includes GEDCOM file processing, individual/family creation, property management, and relationship linking.

## Wikibase Property Structure

### Core Properties Created/Used
- **P7**: Birth date
- **P8**: Death date  
- **P9**: Given name
- **P10**: Surname
- **P11**: Full name
- **P12**: Sex
- **P13**: GEDCOM REFN
- **P14**: Instance of
- **P20**: Child (existing property)
- **P42**: Spouse (existing property) 
- **P46**: Notes page property
- **P47**: Father (newly created)
- **P48**: Mother (newly created)

### Instance Of Classifications
- **Q279**: Gaiad character (for individuals)
- **Q280**: Gaiad family (for family records)

## Current Running Processes

### Active Background Scripts (as of last check)
1. **bash_25**: `database_reviewer.py` - Database analysis
2. **bash_27**: `master_gedcom_creator_fixed.py` - Creating master individuals  
3. **bash_38**: `master_notes_creator.py` - Creating notes pages
4. **bash_49**: `chinese_relationships_final.py` - Adding Chinese relationships
5. **bash_50**: `japanese_relationships_final.py` - Adding Japanese relationships

## Major Technical Challenges Solved

### 0. Missing Individual Handling
- **Challenge**: Some individuals from master GEDCOM were not properly uploaded
- **Solution**: Relationship scripts use `family_has_qids` check to skip families with missing QID mappings
- **Pattern**: `if not family_has_qids: continue` logic prevents relationship errors
- **Status**: Already implemented in Chinese/Japanese scripts, needed for master script

## Major Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. Wikibase API Integration
- **Challenge**: Multiple API method failures (wbcreateclaim vs wbeditentity)
- **Solution**: Standardized on wbeditentity with full statement structure
- **Pattern**: Used `complete_master_uploader.py` as reference for working API calls

### 2. Property Management
- **Challenge**: Missing family relationship properties in Evolutionism Wikibase
- **Solution**: Created P47 (Father) and P48 (Mother) properties
- **Discovery**: P20 (Child) and P42 (Spouse) already existed

### 3. Data Parsing Issues
- **Challenge**: GEDCOM parsing with incorrect string handling
- **Solution**: Fixed tab character parsing (`'\t'` not `'\\t'`) and newline handling
- **Impact**: Resolved zero-result parsing issues

### 4. Unicode Encoding
- **Challenge**: Unicode symbols (‚úì/‚úó) causing encoding crashes
- **Solution**: Replaced with ASCII equivalents (SUCCESS:/ERROR:)

### 5. Large File Processing
- **Challenge**: 99,518+ individual master GEDCOM file processing
- **Solution**: Batch processing with progress indicators and state persistence

## Data Quality and Statistics

### Notes Analysis Results
- **Total individuals with notes**: 61,600
- **Average note length**: 350 characters  
- **Longest note**: 210,982 characters
- **Distribution**: Most notes are brief genealogical annotations

### Upload Success Rates
- **Chinese**: 100% individual upload success, active relationship addition
- **Japanese**: 100% individual upload success, active relationship addition  
- **Master**: Ongoing individual creation with batch error handling
  - **Note**: Some individuals from master GEDCOM were not properly uploaded (random individuals, not important ones)
  - **Impact**: Master relationship script must skip families where individuals lack QID mappings

## Next Steps and TODO Items

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Monitor master GEDCOM creator completion** - `master_gedcom_creator_fixed.py`
2. **Monitor notes creator completion** - `master_notes_creator.py`
3. **Wait for Chinese/Japanese relationship completion** - Both scripts actively working

### Post-Master Creation Tasks
1. **Create master family relationships script** - After individual creation completes
   - Template: Use `chinese_relationships_final.py` pattern
   - Scale: ~93,000+ individuals with family structures
   - Properties: P47 (Father), P48 (Mother), P42 (Spouse), P20 (Child)
   - **Important**: Must handle missing individuals gracefully (some individuals were not properly uploaded from master GEDCOM)

2. **Quality Assurance Review**
   - Verify relationship accuracy
   - Check for duplicate relationships
   - Validate property assignments

### Long-term Maintenance
1. **Performance Monitoring** - Track Wikibase query performance with large dataset
2. **Backup Strategy** - Regular exports of Wikibase data
3. **Update Scripts** - Maintain compatibility with Wikibase updates
