## Notes

- chapter_16.md does not exist (missing file)
- Total chapters validated: 18/19
- Automated syllable counting may not catch all poetic meter nuances
- Human review remains essential for final verification
- Some proper names and archaic words may not be counted accurately by the algorithm

## Technical Details

The validation tool uses heuristic syllable counting based on:
- Vowel clustering patterns
- Silent 'e' handling  
- Common English syllable patterns
- Simple rhyme sound matching (last 2-3 characters)

Perfect automated results suggest either excellent adherence to formal constraints or the need for more sophisticated prosodic analysis tools.
