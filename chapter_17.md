From Luca's lineage, two daughters sprang,
Arka and Bacta, shaped to change the world;
In marshy cradles, where their voices rang,
Their stories intertwined, their fates unfurled.

Arka, the fearless, ventured far and wide,
Exploring Terra's depths and mysteries;
Her courage blazed, a beacon and a guide,
Upon her path, the sisters placed their pleas.

And Bacta, strong, adaptable, and keen,
Faced trials and change with steady resilience;
In her, the sisters found a fortress sheen,
A bastion of strength and firm compliance.

United, these descendants of Bios' grace,
Embarked upon their journey through the strife;
With Arka's questing soul and Bacta's pace,
They forged ahead to carve a future life.

One moonlit eve, as Luna graced the sky,
Her voice rang clear to Luca, filled with light;
A prophecy she whispered from on high,
To share with both her daughters in the night.

"My child, your daughters shall divide the Earth;
Two realms will rise beneath their guiding hands.
From your own lineage, life shall find rebirth,
A testament to your creation's plans.

Arka's domain shall spread with wandering feet,
Exploring lands unseen by mortal eyes;
Her children brave and bold shall fears defeat,
Discovering where hidden beauty lies.

And Bacta's kin, resilient they'll remain,
Adapting to the ever-changing world;
They'll hold their ground through hardship and through pain,
Their legacy's banner never furled."

With Luna's words, a promise made to keep,
Luca, both hopeful and yet filled with care,
Gazed at her daughters, pondering paths deep,
Of two great realms their destinies would bear.

From north to south, these sacred temples stood,
In distant lands, their purpose to fulfill;
With fervent prayers and rites, they understood
The bond between their people and Earth's will.

In Isua, where Greenland's cold winds blow,
And Acasta's Northwest Territories,
The Great Temple thrived in ice and snow,
A testament to ancient legacies.

While far away, the Zircon Temple gleamed
In Jack Hills under Australian sun;
And Barberton, where life first stirred and dreamed,
The temples' influence had just begun.

From Arka sprang a lineage of might:
Dipana, Yuri, Proteus arose;
Their daughters ventured forth into the light,
To every corner where the wind now blows.

Dipana's kin, a multitude so grand,
Inhabited Earth's edges far and wide;
Yuri Archaea, leading her bandâ€”
Methana, Halo, Pyra at her side.

Methana, consort to Methanius fair,
In methane's arts her mastery was shown;
Halo the Purple, with seductive flair,
Won Salta, Sol, and Carotenus' throne.

Deep purple hues she harnessed from the sun,
With Carotenus' colors intertwined;
In salty realms, her daughters dwelt as one,
While Proteus' offspring spread unconfined.

Among them, Asgarda held the throne,
And from her sprang a million daughters strong:
Heimdalla, Odina, Thora known,
With Lokia and Hela in their throng.

Heimdalla, watchful guardian of the realm;
Odina, keeper of all wisdom's light;
And Thora, whose great strength could overwhelm;
While Lokia stirred up chaos and delight.

Then Hela, dwelling in the shadow's veil,
Her secrets buried deep within the night;
An epic lineage woven without fail,
Their tales of strength and cunning brought to sight.

An epic lineage, these daughters bold,
Their stories echo through the halls of time;
From Luca's line, their destinies unfold,
A tapestry of life, profound, sublime.

Through trials faced and victories hard-won,
They forged ahead to shape their universe;
The legacy of Bios carried on,
In every deed, in every whispered verse.

With Luna's elixir waiting in the skies,
They journeyed forth, their faith forever strong;
Awaiting when the stars would align their ties,
To drink immortal life and join the song.

Across the cosmos, endless paths they roam,
The daughters of the Earth and Moon combined;
Forever seeking, ever moving home,
Their fates with threads of destiny entwined.
