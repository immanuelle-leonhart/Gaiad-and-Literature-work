Upon the Moon's cold surface, bleak and bare,
The daughters found that water was too scant;
The icy winds did chill them to despair,
A home unfit where life could not enchant.

Then came the Moon Goddess, fair Usagi,
Luna, radiant in her lunar grace.
A pact she offered to their company,
To aid them in their quest across deep space.

"Go forth and multiply on Terra's land,
While I within my realm shall mix and blend
An elixir of life by my own hand,
To grant you all immortal lives, my friend."

The daughters, grateful, ventured back to Earth,
To flourish, grow, and spread their progeny,
With faith that Luna's promise held true worth,
A potion granting life eternally.

And when the time is ripe, they shall return
To drink the draught that Luna has prepared;
With immortality their souls will burn,
Across the stars, their endless journey shared.

Upon the Earth, fair Gaia welcomed them,
To watery realms and vast abundant shores.
Daughters of Bios thrived within her hem,
In loving arms their spirit upward soars.

To Vaalbara, the lone landmass, they went,
And in the swamps, they found a place to dwell,
Where life and land in harmony were bent,
Their gratitude to Gaia's heart they'd tell.

In Jack Hills' sacred ground, they built a shrine,
From zircon stones, an ancient temple rose;
And to this day, the faithful there align,
In reverence, their devotion ever flows.

So on this Earth, within Gaia's embrace,
They grew and blossomed, cultures rich and new;
A testament to life's enduring grace,
With Mother Earth, their bond forever true.

Within the temple's walls, a daughter stood,
Named Luca, gazing at the starlit dome;
As Sol receded, Luna bright withstood,
And in her heart, a promise found its home.

In twilight's breath, Usagi Luna spoke,
"Each night you'll watch me grind the mortar's blend;
Elixir of immortals I'll invoke,
One day your children's chains of time will end."

And in that distant, ever-reaching sight,
Omega Point where galaxies shall entwineâ€”
Aster and Andromeda will unite,
To form Milkdromeda, a cosmic sign.

As moonset came, young Luca turned away
To swampy homes, her nation to expand;
In Luna's trust, she built anew by day,
The legacy of Bios on the land.
