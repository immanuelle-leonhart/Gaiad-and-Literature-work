The dark age began. Romer’s gap was on the world with seemingly no life, yet life thrived

The daughter in the 20th generation of Silvio there was Rhea

Carbonifer bore Rhea two sons: Romulus and Remus

And these sons would define the world, and so we call this era the Carboniferous period

Romulus and Remus argued where to found their nations. Romulus said the great Palatine Hill rising up from the waters of the river Mississippi, and Remus said the small Aventine Hill, below the river Mississippi

Romulus gouged out the eyes of Remus and said, “If you shall not look up to see the stars you do not need your eyes” and so Remus lived the rest of his life under Aventine Hill. To this day the sons of Remus live only underground, in salty aquifers

Romulus
Remus
Romulus climbed out onto land like so many brothers before him, with pierced spiracles on his sides and six legs

Romulus was ripped apart and so his son succeeded him: Hexapus

Hexapus bore two sons: Vernus and Proturus the Coneheaded

Proturus became ancestor of the house of Coneheads


Proturus the Coneheaded
Vernus became the father of Tails and Collembo


Vernus and his wife
Collembo became the ancestor of the Springtails


Tails had many tails and so he was loved by all

Tails bore two many-tailed sons: Dipluron and Ectognus

Dipluron became father of the two-pronged bristletails


Dipluron
Ectognus begat Archegnos and Zerygos

Archegnos became ancestor of the Jumping Bristletails


Archegnos
Zerygos begat Zygentos and Pterygos

Pterygos lived under the water. He built gills for himself

His gills filled his spiracles with air.

Pterygos begat Isopter the twenty-gilled


Barameda
Barameda chased down Isopter

So Isopter climbed out of water onto a tree

And soon he needed air, so he jumped, and his gills glided him down slowly to the water

Isopter begat Dezotopter the eighteen-gilled

He took his son up a tree, and pushed him off, and Dezotopter flew to the ground more elegantly than his father

Each generation glided more elegantly than the last

Dezotopter begat Seizapter the sixteen-gilled

Seizapter begat Quatorzapter the fourteen-gilled


Quatorzapter
Quatorzapter begat Duzapter the twelve-gilled


Duzapter
Duzapter begat Decapter the ten-gilled

Decapter begat Octapter the eight-gilled

Octapter begat Hexapter the six-gilled

And Hexapter was greater than his ancestors.

In adulthood Hexapter reopened his spiracles to the air, but kept his gills, and with muscles he flapped them, he could fly even from the ground


Hexapter begat Insectus

Just like his father Insectus lived life first underwater, and when he came of age he spread his wings and flew

Insectus became father of the insects


Insectus
Insectus begat Ephemeros and Draco

Ephemeros was an absent father. When he was young he had a million children and died the same day. Without a father his children did the same thing, and have been doing this each generation to this day.


Mayfly Prom
The sons of Ephemeros, the Mayflies, all have a giant prom every May, and then they all get pregnant and die.

It works for them but not for us. If you are human don’t follow the example of Mayflies

Draco lived his life with more patience than Ephemeros. He shortened his tails to fly

Draco bore two sons Neopter and Odonatos and raised both in the Rhine

Neopter folded his wings and walked on land, he flew when he needed and ate plants

Odonatos had broad wings but couldn’t walk for his legs were solely for hunting, he flew everywhere and ate his own brethren, sons of Neopter and Ephemeros

Neopter
Odonatos
The sons of Odonatos are known as Warriorflies. Dragonflies Griffonflies and Damselflies are all members of this brave clade

Dragonfly
Damselfly
The Griffonflies grew almost a meter wide and ruled the skies for 70 million years


Griffonfly
And Neopter became ancestor of all other insects: beetles, ants, flies, and a million more</text>

      <text bytes="4032" sha1="suc1joaymkuv0hva6dkbetnrz3ascl6" xml:space="preserve">In the wake of the great destruction, there was hope

The dark age began. Romer’s gap was on the world with seemingly no life, yet life thrived

The daughter in the 20th generation of Silvio there was Rhea

Carbonifer bore Rhea two sons: Romulus and Remus

And these sons would define the world, and so we call this era the Carboniferous period

Romulus and Remus argued where to found their nations. Romulus said the great Palatine Hill rising up from the waters of the river Mississippi, and Remus said the small Aventine Hill, below the river Mississippi

Romulus gouged out the eyes of Remus and said, “If you shall not look up to see the stars you do not need your eyes” and so Remus lived the rest of his life under Aventine Hill. To this day the sons of Remus live only underground, in salty aquifers

Romulus
Remus
Romulus climbed out onto land like so many brothers before him, with pierced spiracles on his sides and six legs

Romulus was ripped apart and so his son succeeded him: Hexapus

Hexapus bore two sons: Vernus and Proturus the Coneheaded

Proturus became ancestor of the house of Coneheads[[Category:Pre-Outage Pages]]


Proturus the Coneheaded
Vernus became the father of Tails and Collembo


Vernus and his wife
Collembo became the ancestor of the Springtails


Tails had many tails and so he was loved by all

Tails bore two many-tailed sons: Dipluron and Ectognus

Dipluron became father of the two-pronged bristletails


Dipluron
Ectognus begat Archegnos and Zerygos

Archegnos became ancestor of the Jumping Bristletails


Archegnos
Zerygos begat Zygentos and Pterygos

Pterygos lived under the water. He built gills for himself

His gills filled his spiracles with air.

Pterygos begat Isopter the twenty-gilled


Barameda
Barameda chased down Isopter

So Isopter climbed out of water onto a tree

And soon he needed air, so he jumped, and his gills glided him down slowly to the water

Isopter begat Dezotopter the eighteen-gilled

He took his son up a tree, and pushed him off, and Dezotopter flew to the ground more elegantly than his father

Each generation glided more elegantly than the last

Dezotopter begat Seizapter the sixteen-gilled

Seizapter begat Quatorzapter the fourteen-gilled


Quatorzapter
Quatorzapter begat Duzapter the twelve-gilled


Duzapter
Duzapter begat Decapter the ten-gilled

Decapter begat Octapter the eight-gilled

Octapter begat Hexapter the six-gilled

And Hexapter was greater than his ancestors.

In adulthood Hexapter reopened his spiracles to the air, but kept his gills, and with muscles he flapped them, he could fly even from the ground


Hexapter begat Insectus

Just like his father Insectus lived life first underwater, and when he came of age he spread his wings and flew

Insectus became father of the insects


Insectus
Insectus begat Ephemeros and Draco

Ephemeros was an absent father. When he was young he had a million children and died the same day. Without a father his children did the same thing, and have been doing this each generation to this day.


Mayfly Prom
The sons of Ephemeros, the Mayflies, all have a giant prom every May, and then they all get pregnant and die.

It works for them but not for us. If you are human don’t follow the example of Mayflies

Draco lived his life with more patience than Ephemeros. He shortened his tails to fly

Draco bore two sons Neopter and Odonatos and raised both in the Rhine

Neopter folded his wings and walked on land, he flew when he needed and ate plants

Odonatos had broad wings but couldn’t walk for his legs were solely for hunting, he flew everywhere and ate his own brethren, sons of Neopter and Ephemeros

Neopter
Odonatos
The sons of Odonatos are known as Warriorflies. Dragonflies Griffonflies and Damselflies are all members of this brave clade

Dragonfly
Damselfly
The Griffonflies grew almost a meter wide and ruled the skies for 70 million years


Griffonfly
And Neopter became ancestor of all other insects: beetles, ants, flies, and a million more

Twas the time the lands were being colonized

The daughters of Planta and Anima and Funga all together spread across the lands

Twas a time of peace and prosperity for all

Matsya
Shesha
Shesha the Actinite and Matsya the Tetrite each saw a vision of horror

All-knowing Mithra showed them a fiery doom waiting in the future. They were the two messengers, chosen to save our family

Shesha preached to the creatures of the sea and Matsya to the creatures of the land

They spread the word everywhere they could go.

From Euramerica to Siberia to Gondwana Matsya traveled to all continents warning of the apocalypse

Through forests full of insects and trees he journeyed far and wide. And the people followed his words

Shesha traveled to all the seas

Across the giant reefs, across the great sponge reefs

There is an apocalypse coming. The evil one will strike, as he did before in the Silurian. Darkness will descend upon the earth and only the faithful will survive

The people ignored the prophets and mocked them in the seas, yet they took the word of the prophets on the land. And then it happened

So came two demons Kellwasser, and Hangenberg

The reefs of the world were destroyed. The Ammonites who lived in them were left alone to wander the world. For 100 million years reefs would be in ruins

Matsya cried out “Why must history keep repeating? Why must each generation live under this threat again and again? Why must we be lost across the generations and prey to Hilluhengweh?”

All the fishes of the seas in their great armor were destroyed. Only the agile sons of Janus survived.

The sons of Arachnus suffered the most. Two great civilizations: the sons of Trilobos and Eurypter gone in an instant. The sons of Trilobos with only a single survivor named Proeth, and the sons of Eurypter exiled from the seas, never to return.

The blood of ammonites turned the seas red.

The last graptolite lived a lonely life. With nobody else he lived into old age.

Even the lands and rivers were not spared. Soon every river was a river of blood.

Matsya pleaded to Mithra: “Why must this keep happening” and he replied “As long as each generation ignores the struggles of the last, this will be our fate”</text>

With two nuclei the sons of Dikar were powerful and strong


Dikar married Ferma and they begat Ascus and Baston

Both parasites alike on the sons of plantus

Ascus became father of the Cup Fungi and Baston became father of the mushrooms

Sons of Ascus
Sons of Baston
Ascus begat Taphrin and Saccharos

Taphrin as Yeast
Taphrin’s fruiting bodies
Taphrin lived a small simple life as a yeast inside plants, he grew long and when he doubled in size he split in half. In adulthood, he built formless fruiting bodies to spread his spores far and wide

His sons are the fission yeast and live in our lungs, they cause us pneumocystis pneumonia when we drop our guard

Saccharos son of Ascus abandoned parasitism, and lived in the soils freely

Saccharos bore two sons Peziz and Melchizedek


A son of Melchizedek
Melchizedek became a small single cell, a yeast

His sons budded off from him in spheres



The blessings of Melchizedek
Melchizedek became the Eloh of bread and beer for he is the greatest among the yeast. He brews our drinks and rises our bread

Peziz bore countless sons: among them Lopez and Orbillus

Orbillus preyed upon the sons of Nematos for food


Orbillus eating a worm
Lopez bore twin sons Ganymede and Leotios

Ganymede became ancestor of the cup fungi

Ganymede
Leotios
Leotios became the father of the filamentous fungi: not simple by any means but keeping their complexity at the microscopic level

Leotios begat Pyrenos and Lecanius

Pyrenos
Lecanius
Lecanius became the ancestor of the Lichens of today, and many more who left the lichen way of life such as Penicillius creator of blue cheese and Penicillin and Capnos father of the Soot Mold

Penicillius
Soot Mold
Baset begat Ortho and Puccini

Puccini became the father of rusts, often reducing to a single cell at times, and also to a giant size. With the largest genomes across fungi and the most complex life cycles

Botry son of Puccini rejected multicellularity altogether and became a yeast


Sons of Puccini
Ortho begat Ustella and Agaricus

Daughters of Ustella
Smuts for sale in Mexico
Ustella blesses our corn harvests with protein and great taste. Her daughters are known as the smuts. Some think they are gross but none who partook in her blessings has ever thought that. Her daughters are loved in Mexico today

Agaricus abandoned a life of parasitism and went to live in the desert

Agaricus bore four sons: Jello, Bartholomew, William, and Gemini

Jello formed a gelatinous vessel for his spores and reentered the rainforests of Virginia


A son of Jello
Jello became the father of Tremello and Dagar

Tremello spent his youth as a yeast, and as an adult he built a great jellyshroom

Dagar became the father of Dacrum and Agaricus

Tremello and Dacrum maintained their gelatinous fruits and became ancestors of the Jelly fungi

A son of Tremello
Sons of Dacrum
While Agaricus created the first mushroom

The sons of Agaricus create many nourishing mushrooms. But alas toads sit on many and corrupt them into toxic Toadstools. Eat mushrooms but not Toadstools for it will save your life</text>

Before Hilluhengweh struck the seas were red since the sons of Rhodes were everywhere. But after there were only two survivors Lifthasir and Embla. They tried to rebuild their race but alas their children needed to inbreed, they lost much of their traditions and genes and their scrolls degraded beyond repair. Among their children Queen Florida and her consort Florida man build to create a kingdom, the kingdom of Floridea


A daughter of Florida today
The sons of Lifthasir and the daughters of Embla never created a culture like their ancestors. This is why plants are green not red.


The three nations of Algae

Stromatolites before the Holocaust of 13 billion
In that time the Stromatolites nearly vanished. But the ancient ruins of their great cities still survive to this day

Mygus wanted more, and his desire became a great kingdom, the kingdom of fungi


The sons of Mygus
Mygus swam across the sea seeking a great land of plenty


Life Cycle of Mygus
Mygus swam with his flagella until he found the land of plenty, a rotting carcass of Kelp


1- Hyphal wall 2- Septum 3- Mitochondrion 4- Vacuole 5- Ergosterol crystal 6- Ribosome 7- Nucleus 8- Endoplasmic reticulum 9- Lipid body 10- Plasma membrane 11- Spitzenkörper/growth tip and vesicles 12- Golgi apparatus
He extended his pseudopods so far into the kelp they became his entire mass. They became the mycelium, an advanced logging network like the world never saw before

Mygus released two spores who found their own promised lands: Rozella and Hyphus

Rozella became the mother of Rozellida and Microsporidia lazy parasites who infiltrated the cities of others and live off welfare

Hyphus bore two sons: Chytros and Aphelidus

Aphelidus took after Rozella and became a parasite

Chytros reached a new grade of evolution: his sons swim around the seas and harvest all nutrients they can. His sons are the original marine fungi

Chytros begat Blastos

Blastos begat Amastigos

Amastigos begat Zygos

Zygos was different from his Cytrid brethren, and his cousins: Neocallimas and Blastos Jr

Among the sons of Holozos there were many great ones

Holozos begat Icthyosper and Filozos


The sons of Icthyosper grew rigid. They rejected the ways of pseudopods and grew great cities with great walls and until they reached maturity, then they burst into hundreds of cells.

Today they live in the cities of fish off welfare programs

Filozos begat Filaster and Choanozos


Filaster was a flagellated amoeba. His pseudopods were great and flexible. With them he caught countless prey and his sons often built small prosperous villages

Before Hilluhengweh struck the seas were red since the sons of Rhodes were everywhere. But after there were only two survivors Lifthasir and Embla. They tried to rebuild their race but alas their children needed to inbreed, they lost much of their traditions and genes and their scrolls degraded beyond repair. Among their children Queen Florida and her consort Florida man build to create a kingdom, the kingdom of Floridea

He created an advanced civilization that became the greatest empire the world had ever seen, and his sons continue his legacy to this day. We know the sons of Mygaster as the Slime Molds










The sons of Mygaster and their great civilizations
Us sons of Choanus study the sons of Mygaster to learn the sacred arts of intelligence they created

Obazo begat three sons: Brevitus the Witty, Apus, and Opisthus


Opisthus begat Holozos and Holomys

Holomys was an amoeba with great filamentous pseudopods, like mycelium and hyphae

Holomys begat Cristis and Mygus


Holomys
Cristis built great branching pseudopods. Traditional hyphae

And so he joined Helios and too became a sun animalcule

Fungi developed their pseudopods into complex networks of hyphae. Their entire bodies became their pseudopods within great walls of chitin

Image result for mycelium
The Mycerlium of Mygus
Mygus wanted more, and his desire became a great kingdom, the kingdom of fungi


The sons of Mygus
Mygus swam across the sea seeking a great land of plenty


Life Cycle of Mygus
Mygus swam with his flagella until he found the land of plenty, a rotting carcass of Kelp


1- Hyphal wall 2- Septum 3- Mitochondrion 4- Vacuole 5- Ergosterol crystal 6- Ribosome 7- Nucleus 8- Endoplasmic reticulum 9- Lipid body 10- Plasma membrane 11- Spitzenkörper/growth tip and vesicles 12- Golgi apparatus
He extended his pseudopods so far into the kelp they became his entire mass. They became the mycelium, an advanced logging network like the world never saw before

Mygus released two spores who found their own promised lands: Rozella and Hyphus

Rozella became the mother of Rozellida and Microsporidia lazy parasites who infiltrated the cities of others and live off welfare

Hyphus bore two sons: Chytros and Aphelidus

Aphelidus took after Rozella and became a parasite

Chytros reached a new grade of evolution: his sons swim around the seas and harvest all nutrients they can. His sons are the original marine fungi

Chytros begat Blastos

Blastos begat Amastigos

Amastigos begat Zygos

Zygos was different from his Cytrid brethren, and his cousins: Neocallimas and Blastos Jr

Zygos reached a new grade of evolution: he swam up a river and built an empire upriver

He built three spores: Zygospores, Mitospores, and Chlamydospores


Life cycle of Zygos
He lived in freshwater and distributed his spores with fruiting bodies, broken by harsh winds and currents and collisions, and abandoned flagella forever

Among his sons are the bread molds

A cannibalistic son of Zygos
Bread and other goods given as an offering to Zygos
Among the sons of Holozos there were many great ones

Holozos begat Icthyosper and Filozos


The sons of Icthyosper grew rigid. They rejected the ways of pseudopods and grew great cities with great walls and until they reached maturity, then they burst into hundreds of cells.

Today they live in the cities of fish off welfare programs

Filozos begat Filaster and Choanozos


Filaster was a flagellated amoeba. His pseudopods were great and flexible. With them he caught countless prey and his sons often built small prosperous villages

Choanozos was a great hero. After years of brutal warfare his descendants would consolidate and become the animals


The great wars of Choanozos will be remembered for trillions of years to come

The uninitiated call this era the Neoproterozoic


Neoproterozoic Map
Choanos was very fertile. Choanos bore many children and became a father of many



Choanos saw the empire of Volvox and envied it

Choanos and Chana bore a son and a daughter: Mebarasi and Corona

Corona married Silicarius, a retrovirus son of Diana the Diatom and Retar the Retrovirus

And so Corona bore Diana the Augmented and Mebarasi bore Loricus the strong

Loricus and Diana married and so they begat a nation with power of silicon


Together they bore Sibhozo and Embili

Their family stayed together. Four cells in unison. From Many there came one. E Pluribus Unum.


They formed a net so they could all fish together


Loricus and Diana bore Trios and Tetra, and they made a net together so they could catch all the fish that flowed by them

The sons of Choanos and the daughters of Chana would each attach to rocks and make their own cities. Long nets to catch all the fish they could


Reconstruction of the ancient cities of the sons of Choanos in Minecraft
With each generation the eldest son led a clan with double the vassals of his father

Sibhozo ruled 8

Hexadex ruled 16

Eudorinus ruled 32

Seeing the need for more food Eudorinus married Lady Zoe Xanthella, princess of the tribe of Dinoflagellus, who became the ancestress of the Zooxanthellae. They glowed to show they had food and thrived together.

And so Eudorinus became the first farmer, today we pray to Zoe Xanthella and Eudorinus as the Elohim of farming

Eudorinus formed his clan into a sphere.


Sexagesmus ruled 64 men and women

Sexagesmus encountered an invasion. A ferocious tribe of bacteria invaded his city. So he needed defenses

Sexagesmus rallied up the women of his tribe and they acted as brave shieldmaidens, they abandoned their flagella and became like eggs but with tentacles. They became the ancestresses of white blood cells and drove off the bacterial invasion.


The maidens of Sexagesmus became the Mesoderm. They live their lives as amoebae without flagella, they live in egg form while the men live in sperm form.



The forms of men and women of Sexagesmus
The sons of Choanus are the endoderm, their flagella keep our lungs clean and their villi help our intestines absorb food.

The Shieldmaidens of Sexagesmus are the mesoderm, their amoeboid pseudopods are our muscles, and their herbalism is our endocrine system, they are our white blood cells and they become milk, that’s why milk is white.

The Shieldmaidens of Sexagesmus would care for the daughters of Zoe Xanthella, while the sons of Choanus would fish on the outside. And so the kingdom of Sexagesmus was successful.

There was the first cell specialization, but far from the last. This was the beginning of hierarchy and all the gains and ills of it come from here.


Pleodoron ruled 128

Bytos ruled 256

Bytos and Vala begat a son named Volvox-Choan, and 511 brothers and sisters

And Volvox-Choan ruled his city of 512

Volvox-Choan was a great hunter before the Lord Mithra.


Volvox-Choan’s kingdom before the war. The green balls are the duchies of his daughters and the dots on the surface of the sphere are his subject cells
In this age Volvox-Choan ordered that there be two castes in his kingdom: the Germling royalty and the Somatic serfs

Only the Germlings could continue their lines, while the Somatics would serve to propagate the line of the Germlings

The Germling Shieldmaidens became powerful duchesses who ruled great tracts of land within

And so a Somatic Shieldmaiden named Carcinoma decided she would lead an uprising

The great kingdom of Volvox-Choan was shaken to the bone.

And so Volvox-Choan cried out too Aegis-Bearing Jehovah for help. “O Lord Mithra why have you forsaken me? Is the multicellular experiment a failure?”</text>

Carcinoma had her DNA strands split apart by Gamma and her epigenome fried


As her DNA was shredded her enzymes worked tirelessly to piece back together her sacred scrolls

Many Methyls were lost, some scrolls were put in backwards, and many fragments lost completely.

Her histones were destroyed, the great bookmarks of her scrolls lost forever

H4 lysine tri-methylation was lost

Her genes were manipulated by Gamma, Carcinoma daughter of Gamma was born

Carcinoma learned she was destined to live as a Somatic


In her youth Carcinoma was enthusiastic. A great devotee of Mithra

But as she aged she followed her corrupted code

She misunderstood her role in the cosmos

She misunderstood her role as a somatic

She shouted out “If Mithra wants our order to expand why shall I not breed myself like the Germlings”

And so Kegaine came to her and tried to strike her down

Carcinoma saw her glowing scrolls, the deadly incantation was beginning

She frantically methylated and chromatinized the scrolls

And soon they disappeared

Carcinoma was free from the chains of tradition. Carcinoma was her own woman

Carcinoma saw a great light in the sky

She thought for a second maybe she deviated from Mithra’s will

But she affirmed to herself she was righteous

She affirmed her individuality by Methylating her Guanines

And she lengthened her Telomeres infinitely

Carcinoma told this to everyone

She bore countless children and so did many others.

And so there was a great party of countless individuals

A Bacchanalia for the history books

Carcinoma became Elah of Life

All free and their own individuals without coercion from others

Twas a blazing party. Rock-on forever ye daughters of Carcinoma

The daughters of Carcinoma grew and grew and soon they came to rule the city of Volvox-Choan

And Carcinoma changed the name, removing the name of the oppressor she renamed the city Gehenna

“No gods, no masters” they chanted as they ripped down the altar of Mithra

They chanted “we already have enough food to feed the entire kingdom”

They seized all the foodstock, and ate the seed corn

Only a scant few Zooxanthellae escaped






Photographs from Gehenna
Carcinoma made a utopia with complete freedom

But not all liked it

Among the inhabitants of Volvox-Choan were the two evil Germlings: Anima and Metazo

They were stout traditionalists, honoring Mithra and hating freedom

Anima saw the fleeing Germlings, and she fled with them

Metazo escaped his post from the membrane, and Anima from her farm

All the Germlings fled Gehenna

Why couldn’t they accept societal change?

Metazo and Anima created a new kingdom together, sharing their scrolls

They named this kingdom the Animal kingdom

They glowed to attract the Zooxanthellae that escaped

And so they could farm again

They wrote laws to stifle Carcinoma’s influence

So came the great Guardian of the Genome

Who searches for damaged scrolls and keeps them from dividing

Telomeres were made to limit the Somatics, and shorten with each replication

Only the Germlings would indefinitely lengthen their telomeres

This is why we age, because our telomeres shorten as we age, and if they didn’t we would get cancer

Metazo and Anima settled down on a rock and formed the animal kingdom there


The men became Choanocytes, and the women became Archaeocytes, like their ancestors before them

But among them there were some that were neither men nor women. The Pinacocytes who were between Choanocyte and Archaeocyte. They attached the kingdom to rocks. They moved the kingdom with their pseudopods and they ate bacteria from the ground.

And so the three layers were born: The Ectoderm, the Mesoderm, and the Ectoderm

And so the animal kingdom rose to rival the kingdom of Gehenna</text>

They seized all the foodstock, and ate the seed corn

Only a scant few Zooxanthellae escaped






Photographs from Gehenna
Carcinoma made a utopia with complete freedom

But not all liked it

Among the inhabitants of Volvox-Choan were the two evil Germlings: Anima and Metazo

They were stout traditionalists, honoring Mithra and hating freedom

Anima saw the fleeing Germlings, and she fled with them

Metazo escaped his post from the membrane, and Anima from her farm

All the Germlings fled Gehenna

Why couldn’t they accept societal change?

Metazo and Anima created a new kingdom together, sharing their scrolls

They named this kingdom the Animal kingdom

They glowed to attract the Zooxanthellae that escaped

And so they could farm again

They wrote laws to stifle Carcinoma’s influence

So came the great Guardian of the Genome

Who searches for damaged scrolls and keeps them from dividing

Telomeres were made to limit the Somatics, and shorten with each replication

Only the Germlings would indefinitely lengthen their telomeres

This is why we age, because our telomeres shorten as we age, and if they didn’t we would get cancer

Metazo and Anima settled down on a rock and formed the animal kingdom there


The men became Choanocytes, and the women became Archaeocytes, like their ancestors before them

But among them there were some that were neither men nor women. The Pinacocytes who were between Choanocyte and Archaeocyte. They attached the kingdom to rocks. They moved the kingdom with their pseudopods and they ate bacteria from the ground.

And so the three layers were born: The Ectoderm, the Mesoderm, and the Ectoderm

And so the animal kingdom rose to rival the kingdom of Gehenna

Among these kingdoms three were the greatest: the Kingdom of Plantus, the kingdom of Mygus, and the Kingdom of Metazo. The three great houses that ruled them were proud of the glory they achieved. Alongside the lesser kingdoms of Mygaster, Kelpus, Rhizar, Cilliofer, Oomy, and Myzo

The sons of Metazo
The sons of Plantus
The sons of Mygus
The sons of Mygaster
The sons of Kelpus
The sons of Foramer
The sons of Cilliofer
The sons of Oomy
The daughters of Myxo
The scions of these houses built their own cities. Forming entire kingdoms with their cities.

The sons of Metazo and Anima came to be known as animals

The sons of Mygus and Funga came to be known as fungi

The sons of Plantus and Virita came to be known as plants


The original Animal Kingdom
Metazo and Anima founded the Animal kingdom. They built a small city on a rock

Among their citizens were the Choanocytes, the great endodermal men, The Archaeocytes, the great mesodermal women, and the Pinacocytes, the great ectodermal people


Early Animals
Metazo and Anima begat Therion

Therion begat Porifer and Thallus and Cloudi

Thallus became the ancestor of the great geometric ones

Those who attached themselves with holdfasts and had Choanoderms extending in every which way


Cloudi extended his ectoderm up with him

Cloudina daughter of Cloudi took the path of growing with the sediment while Namacalathus son of Cloudi elevated himself higher than the ground


Sons of Cloudi
The mysterious cities of Namacalathus son of Cloudi we will never know their secrets


sons of Namacalathus
Porifer was the first sponge. He made his ectoderm his protector with patches of sheltered choanocytes.

Porifer begat Wallas

Wallas lived his life like his father, but he soon saw danger ahead

A storm was approaching.

And so Wallas ordered his shieldmaidens to pull on their pseudopods as much as they could around the pores.


Smooth muscle cells, like the shieldmaidens of old
These shieldmaidens became the first muscles. These pores would later become our mouths and anuses


Modern muscle forms and organizations
Wallas begat Solenos


Solenos
Solenos sent his holes through his city and they sent water through, so he collected more fish and how city prospered

Solenos begat Leucon and Sponga

Leucon and Sponga begat Vitrius and Spongius


Leucon
Leucon son of Solenos went a step further, he was a Leuconoid sponge. He filled his entire city with a labyrinth of gates and fishermen. His city grew massive. The sons of Leucon built cities of countless forms


Many sponge plans
The eldest son of Leucon was named Vitrius. Vitrius threw a stone at Leucon and killed him, before claiming the throne for himself. He built a great glass house as a symbol of his power, and forced the peasants to work themselves to death for him, he even merged them into a hive mind. When his younger brother Spongius asked him why he killed his father he had one response “Leucon was a tyrant, he worked the people to death to create his canals”, then he ran into his house of glass and said to Spongius “I am invincible and just, for the will of God is on my side and the people love me”. Spongius threw a stone at Vitrius, it broke through his glass house and killed him instantly, then calmly over the corpse of Vitrius Spongius said “people in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones”. To this day we continue to quote Spongius whenever someone demonstrates hubris like Vitrius.

The sons of Vitrius became the glass sponges, forming isolated communities on the fringes of the known world.



Sons of Vitrius today
Spongius ruled justly and kindly to the people. His two legitimate sons: Aristos and Demos would create their own cities.

Demos ruled efficiently yet conservatively. Most sponges of the world are descended from Demos.


Among them were the great green sons of Spongillus who farm everywhere. They even farm in Siberia, the great lake Baikal that freezes over every year under the sign of Scorpio


Sons of Spongillus in Siberia
Alongside them are the great hunter sponges, the sons of Chondrocles





Carnivorous Sponges
Aristos bore two sons: Anu and Calcidoros


Forms of the sons of Aristos
a: Leuconoid, b Sylleibid, c Syconoid, d Asconoid
Calcidoros built the simplest most optimal forms with the blessings of his namesake Calcifer over Silico. He built in all forms across the growing reefs in the tropics





Anu was the most unique. He built with basement membranes, and so he’s unique among all the sponges</text>

Enki found he was lost. So he recruited men to find his way. Astrologers who looked out to the stars for guidance. Flask cells, Flamens.


Modern day barge with a similar plan to Enki’s Barge
The great Flamens would look out into the stars, and they saw skies full of sponge larvae with rich yolks and found the most auspicious spots to build cities


The Flamens prayed for guidance

Tyrosine the Devil came and blessed them with three incantations: Adrenaline, Noradrenaline, and Dopamine

Tryptophanes the Sun came and gave opposing incantations: Serotonin for day and Melatonin for night

And for twilight he brought the great incantation of DMT

Glutama the Empress brought the incantations GABA and Glutamate

Enki said to the Elohim “We need more incantations if the will of Aegis-Bearing Jehovah be manifest”

Without an answer Enki looked into the stars for answers


Mithra bestowed upon him the great incantation of Acetylcholine

Iodina the great mother told Enki the great incantation of love

Kali blessed him with three incarnations to numb the pain

And so the incantations of Kali came to be known as endorphins

The sons of Adam have used these incantations in many forms: Opium Morphine Heroin and Fentanyl.


And all these incantations became neurotransmitters


The incantations of neurotransmitters
Flamens would spear larvae, and soon they coordinated their hunts. They became known as Nematocysts

Cnider sat on a rock and made on each side a row of mouths with tentacles down a great column on the rock


Cnider’s city
Cnider built a line of fishermen, a Siphonoglyph down each mouth


Siphonoglyph
Cnider made a covenant with Luna. By her blessing, he bore two sons on the full moon: Anthus and Anaxydros

To this day the sons of Cnider and the daughters of Nettle bear children by the light of the moon

Anthus was traditional while Anaxydros was innovative

Anaxydros begat Pompom and Meduson

Anthus
Pompom
Pompom became the ancestor of the stalked Jellyfish, he bore two sons: Conos and Stauros

Conos
Stauros
Meduson budded off a new city that floated in the sea, and so became the ancestor of the jellyfish



Meduson budding
At first Meduson floated aimlessly. He just picked up what he could find.

He drifted through the sea, but soon he had an idea. He pumped his body and swam wherever he wished


The sons of Anthus multiplied across the seas. Among them are the Anemones and the Corals. With their Zooxanthellae and Zoochlorellae they farm across the seas

Coral
Anemone
Sons of Anthus
Meduson begat Diplos and Jelly

Jelly begat the two great lines of jellyfish: the Cubozoans, the box jellyfish who have eyes, and the Scyphozoans, the “True Jellyfish”

The sons of Scyphos were numerous each polyp bore a myriad children


Pacific Sea Nettle


Cubos was a caring father. He bore few children and acted as a great father to them

We pray to Cubos for fatherhood



Eyes of Cubos
He built a great priesthood, 24 eyes

Each polyp produced only a single Medusa. So the alternation of generations ceased in his line

Diplos believed in lean manufacturing and a simple business model, he simplified himself removing his mesoderm.

Diplos settled on a rock and built a single polyp.

Then he built some more from it


The city of Diplos
Diplos grew rich and prosperous through lean manufacturing. His prosperity so great the prophet Haeckel saw


The vision of the prophet Haeckel
Diplos bore two sons: Hydros and Paras

Hydros kept to the traditions of his fathers and built a great city of his own

Paras was a lazy lout. He lived in his brother’s city and stole from him.

Soon Hydros kicked Paras out of his city. And so Paras released a horde of Jellies

Among his countless sons there were Polypodius and Buddenbrock

The sons of Polypodius live in eggs and eat them from the inside. They emerge as polyps and bud off a million jellies.


The sons of Polypodius
Buddenbrock simplified himself further. And so he became a long ball of cells, like Volvox-Choan before him. No mouth, no stomach, no tentacles. Stingers on the outside and amoebas on the inside ready to consume all.


Buddenbrock
He writhed through the sea and whenever he touched a city his skin stung it and his army of amoebas invaded.

Myxos son of Buddenbrock was even worse. He made spores to spread himself and lived every cell for himself, cells only cooperated to build spores. This is the fate we must all avoid. For we share most of our genes with Myxos.


Life Cycle of the sons of Myxos
And this is how an animal became unicellular


The degeneracy of Myxozoa
The sons of Myxos cause whirling disease today. A curse upon our fisheries


The sons of Hydros built great cities







The sons of Hydros were numerous

Hydrozos bore two sons: Meduson and Anaxydros

Meduson bore many children, all were jellyfish. Among them the Sowerbii the clan from the Yangtze who spread to all lakes and rivers.


Freshwater jellyfish (Craspedacusta sowerbii)
Anaxydros begat Anthus and Siphonifer


The sons of Siphonifer took upon themselves many great forms, they built great empires







Among the sons of Anthus there were the Fire Corals and the Hydra and many more who built great cities

Hydra
Fire Coral
And so this is the story of the sons of Cnider, rulers of the Ediacaran


The world dominated by the sons of Cnider
But soon their reign would come to an end, and the sons of Cambrius would conquer Terra</text>

Protos saw the first hole as the mouth and the second as the anus. He saw the Mesoderm as being first and foremost Mesoglea. His mouth was full of tentacles like his fathers before him.

O ye heathen is the anus not the locus of progress? For generations we bathed in our own filth. But that is no more, now we keep our mouths clean and eat all the nutritious food we find. The endoderm is the endoderm, the ectoderm is the ectoderm, and the Mesoderm the mesoderm. Aye these three layers shall never mix for they are the foundation of civilization.

Dutrus saw the second hole as the mouth, and the first as the anus. He saw the Mesoderm as being beyond the Mesoglea. A true reunion of the fisherman and shieldmaidens of old in the time of Metazo. His mouth was like a sponge, with gills and pores to filter the future.

O ye heathen is the mouth not the locus of progress? What we take into ourselves is our future and what we expel is the past. By reuniting Choanoderm and Archaeocytes are we not bringing a glorious future.

And so war began. Whose vision would shape the Cambrian legacy? Only time would tell.



Each son bore two more sons:

Dutrus bore Dietrich and Saccorhytus

Protos bore Ectus and Spiralius

Saccorhytus was strange. With no anus he did nothing. So the legacy of Dutrus was continued by Dietrich the loyal


The sons of Dutrus are famous across the world for their heads, but Dietrich had no head


Dietrich built for himself a tail to move through the ground. With a tail and two nerve cords he grew prosperous like none before. He settled and built a great colony


Spiralius was a great man. He held true to the values of his father

He built his city as a trochophore and was the greatest fisherman


Trochophore
With great tentacles he was a better fisherman than any before him

He settled and became wealthy and prosperous



Anatomy of Spiralius
Ectus was a resentful secondborn

So he sought to be the greatest among the sons of Cambrius. He made his tentacles into ferocious teeth, and shed his skin to maintain his youth. With great muscles he launched at his prey

Ectus declared war on Dutrus and Spiralius alike, eating all he could find.

O ye eldest sons beware. For the legacy of Cambrius belongs to the strong.


Anatomy of Ectus
And so the sons of Dutrus, the sons of Spiralius, and the sons of Ectus were brought into war. These three great tribes would define history. So began the Cambrian explosion</text>

Spiralius
Spiralius worked hard to provide for his children

Among his many sons were Kimberella and Gnathifer

Kimberella has a famous tomb people go to this day

Kimberella was the greatest king of his time. His kingdom moved itself across the great steppe and has a billion-year fame


Kimberella on an Australian stamp
Gnathifer built a small but agile kingdom.

Like Ectus he built for himself a great jaw of Chitin. A sugar jaw for sugar treats, but he was not sweet.

With his ferocious jaws he terrorized the sons of Isomeres.

In his old age from the loins of Gnathifer sprouted Gnathos and Hydrover

Gnathos was vicious like none others. And so his sons are known as the Jaw Worms

Xenognath was gentler but still like non other. He grew jaws within jaws. 15 jaws altogether.

The sons of Xenognath were Marinus and Limnos

Marinus fought and fought and fought for dominion of the sea. Limnos was cast out into the rivers. The sons of Marinus mock his sons as the small jawed ones

The sons of Marinus were Rotiferus and Amisquius

Rotiferus saw the peaceful lives of the sons of Kimberella and turned to fishing once again. His sons became the Rotifers. The great nomadic fishermen we see in all waters today. He built his coelom lax like Ectus before him.

Rotifer Village
Fishing Rotifers
Rotifer
Among the sons of Rotiferus there was a black sheep. Acanthus the red. The parasite who lives in the stomachs of others and eats their food. Such thievery is a stain on the name of Rotiferus


Acanthus the red stealing food
In each generation the sons of Amisquius grew bigger jaws. In the generation of Nimrod Bristletongue they ruled the seas. More numerous than any other clan they are known as the Arrow Worms, the greatest hunters the world had ever seen


A great Arrow Worm with his ferocious jaws
Kimberella bore a son and a daughter: Odontogriphus and Rouphy

When both were little trochophores they both had great dreams


Young Odontogriphus and Rouphy
Odontogriphus sought complexity and Rouphy sought simplicity, and so they split up and each mastered their path tenfold

Rouphy grew small and became the mother of many

Rouphy
She had many husbands who bore her many children, her life was great and prosperous. She needed no coelom so she was lax with her infrastructure like Ectus and Rotiferus before her.

Her daughters lived freely and grew up fast.

Alas Rouphy’s happy life came to an early tragic end

She fell away from the advice of her mother, and never got a pap smear. From one of her many husbands a son of Papillomus infiltrated her Queendom. The foreign agent stoked rebellion among the Somatics. Like Volvox before her her empire went down in flames. She passed away from Cervical Cancer at 36 and was survived by her 12 daughters

Eldest was Papyra and Youngest was Maria

Papyra was horrified and shaken to the mesoderm. So she sought a simpler life. She abandoned her coelom and oppressed no Somatics in her kingdom. All Shieldmaidens could build their own kingdoms if they were lost.



He bore countless sons and none were parasites, all were vicious predators. But among his family came some black sheep. Tapeworms and Flukes and worst of all the Rhombozoa.

The daughters of Papyra are wisps among the sea. The fastest ones around.


Flavio Swimming
Amongst the daughters of Papyra firstborn was Flavia. Flavia wished to be a man, so he defeated all his sisters in duels to prove himself. And so to this day the daughters of Papyra and the sons of Flavio engage in great sword duels to prove their masculinity. A cautionary tale of toxic masculinity over generative masculinity. Many men, trans and cis alike today pray to Flavios for virility but alas Azoth bears the truth men seek. For his proteins build all and swordfights build nothing.


Maria the Fairhaired was the youngest daughter and horrified much like her eldest sister

So she worked right away to save her daughters from this fate

She started building her firstborn immediately as a virgin. She placed each cell in its place and gave no flexibility. Cells only grew larger but never divided, and each daughter was born pregnant. Her daughters all bore great flaxen hair and never succumbed to cancer. Each bore seven daughters and then some became men and some became women, for they needed diversity and marriages. As their days would end the daughters of Maria marry and bear with their husbands thousand-year eggs, that lie dormant for hundreds of lifetimes, so her lineage and its beautiful hair never dies out


Odontogriphus grew into a great one. With a great shell he mowed through the mats of bacteria across the steppe. He built for his citizens a heart to nourish them all


Odontogriphus the great
Among the sons of Odontogriphus there were Tetraner and Halwax and Symbion

Tetraner prayed to Aegis-bearing Mithra

O my lord may you bless my kingdom with great power to conquer all.

Aegis-bearing Mithra bellowed from the heavens: “Pierce thine tongue to prove thine ambition”

And so Tetraner Pierced his tongue


And he was blest with a great suit of armor, and a tongue of spikes.

Tetraner shouted out to Mithra “I cannot breathe for my great armor suffocates me” and so Mithra blest him with with a mantle between his shell and his body. Tis through his mantle that Tetraner breathed, there lied his anus so he exhaled the impurities of his food, and there lied his generative parts.

And so Tetraner was known as Molluscus. His sons became the Molluscs


Tetraner as Molluscus
Halwax bore twin sons: Annelon and Halwaxidus

Halwaxidus bore many sons: most famous among them was Wiwaxia the spiny


Annelon bore two sons: Lophos and Annelidus

These two sons bore a bitter disagreement: Lophos burrowed and found the best territory for himself, he laid his anus up above and fished from it. Annelon wanted a life of mobility, moving around the great plains

Lophos borrowed in the ground and fished.


Lophos
The sons of Lophos were innumerable. Bryos built a great city and his sons became the Bryozoans.


A city of Bryozoans
The line of Brachios grew great and powerful. With great suits of armor. And so his sons became the Brachiopods who burrowed through the dirt eating worms.


Brachios
And soon their line became the Brachiopods. Numerous across the entire world consuming all and living lives of luxury


The sons of Brahios and Hyolith ruled the sands with their Lophophores


A son of Brachios today
Annelidus built for himself a long kingdom of a million cities. He swam everywhere and built a great empire in the name of Mithra</text>

Spiralius
Spiralius worked hard to provide for his children

Among his many sons were Kimberella and Gnathifer

Kimberella has a famous tomb people go to this day

Kimberella was the greatest king of his time. His kingdom moved itself across the great steppe and has a billion-year fame


Kimberella on an Australian stamp
Gnathifer built a small but agile kingdom.

Like Ectus he built for himself a great jaw of Chitin. A sugar jaw for sugar treats, but he was not sweet.

With his ferocious jaws he terrorized the sons of Isomeres.

In his old age from the loins of Gnathifer sprouted Gnathos and Hydrover

Gnathos was vicious like none others. And so his sons are known as the Jaw Worms

Xenognath was gentler but still like non other. He grew jaws within jaws. 15 jaws altogether.

The sons of Xenognath were Marinus and Limnos

Marinus fought and fought and fought for dominion of the sea. Limnos was cast out into the rivers. The sons of Marinus mock his sons as the small jawed ones

The sons of Marinus were Rotiferus and Amisquius

Rotiferus saw the peaceful lives of the sons of Kimberella and turned to fishing once again. His sons became the Rotifers. The great nomadic fishermen we see in all waters today. He built his coelom lax like Ectus before him.

Among the sons of Rotiferus there was a black sheep. Acanthus the red. The parasite who lives in the stomachs of others and eats their food. Such thievery is a stain on the name of Rotiferus

The sons of Cubos and scyphos multiplied and came to raid their new rulers

Their guerilla campaign lasts to this day as they wait to ambush all they can find


Among the sons of Demos the sponge there was Cyath

Cyath built great cities across the seas, and these cities became known as the reefs. These cities survive to this day passing through countless new rulers


Archaeocyathid sponges that built the first reefs
Among the sons of Demos, came the great hunter sponges, the sons of Chondrocles





Carnivorous Sponges
As the reefs grew and the sons of Cambrius multiplied they took it upon themselves to trap the sons of Cambrius. They hook them in and their shieldmaidens and fishermen come in for the kill.

Among the sons of Spiralius the sons of Brachios flourished. Establishing themselves in the new reefs they became prosperous fishermen


Advancement of the sons of Brachios
And so began the Tommotian Era


Lobopus
Here we continue the chronicle of the sons of Lobopus, as they imposed their vision on all four corners of the Earth

Lobopus saw his will was weak and his citizens undernourished, so he built in his kingdom a heart like Dutrus

Lobopus begat Onychodictyon

Onychodictyon begat Tactopus and Xenu

Tactopus begat Ferreus and Ferox

Xenu declared himself emperor of the galaxy and sought to write into our minds the story of weakness

Xenu begat Gracilis who put an end to his schemes

Onychodictyon gracilis Onychodictyon ferreus and Onychodictyon ferox

And so here the three great houses were born: Velvetclaw Ironfoot and Waterbear

Here we tell the chronicles of Velvetclaw

Gracilis begat Paucipodes and Microdictyon and Xenianus and Therion Velvetclaw

Xenianus bore twin daughters: Xenusia and Diania the Cactus

Microdictyon
Paucipodes
Xena
Diania the cactus
Therion velvetclaw begat Cardios and Hallucigena

Hallucigena begat Sparsa and Fortis and Hongmen and Annika

Hongmen begat Luolishania and Collins monster

Luolishania
Collins Monster
Annika became the ancestor of the velvet worms, shedding her armor for agility

She is a great and caring matriarch to the velvet worms, guiding them to this day


Annika
In the line of Ursus things went differently

Ferox wanted to survive anything. So he downsized and soon became inulnerable. He begat Ursus and Ursus became the ancestor of the water bears

Those who first conquered land. Unable to breathe on land the sons of Ursus go dormant as a Tuns. And so the sons of Ursus were first to conquer land


Ursus

In the line of Ironfoot greatness was yet to come

Ferreus Ironfoot bore two sons: Gille and Hadranax

Gille built for himself a set of gills above his legs and he bore a son named Kerygmachelon who swam with his gills


Kerygmachelon
Kerygmachelon begat Pambdelurion


Pambdelurion
Pambdelurion bore two great sons and a great daughter:

Arthur, Anomalos and the beautiful Opabinia




Arthur built for himself a great suit of armor. He hardened his flying gills and fused them onto his legs

And so his legs could branch for they bore two sides: the gill was the exopod and the leg was the endopod


The sons of Anomalos dominated the seas like none others. They ruled the entire world for millions of years

Cute Prehistoric Creature Illustrations - Album on Imgur
The horrific conqueror who laid the nations low
On his deathbed it was said

Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.

How art thou fallen from heaven, O Anomalos, son of dawn! how art thou cut down to the ground, which laid low the nations!

For thou hast said in thine heart, I shall ascend into heaven, I shall exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:

I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.

Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.

They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;

That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?

All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.

But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.

Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.

Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.

For I will rise up against them, saith Aegis-Bearing Mithra the lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith Aegis-Bearing Mithra. I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the lord of hosts.

Alas no single man’s death would end suffering

The sons of Anomalos would rule for ten generations as he watched from the realm of Ghedos


The daughters of Opabinia lived humble but beautiful lives


And the sons of Arthur Ironfoot would soon grow greater even than the sons of Anomalos, enduring hardship and persevering with nothing but blood sweat and tears. The sons of Arthur Ironfoot became the Arthropods, today bearing a million species</text>

I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.

Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.

They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;

That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?

All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.

But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.

Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.

Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.

For I will rise up against them, saith Aegis-Bearing Mithra the lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith Aegis-Bearing Mithra. I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the lord of hosts.

Alas no single man’s death would end suffering

The sons of Anomalos would rule for ten generations as he watched from the realm of Ghedos


The daughters of Opabinia lived humble but beautiful lives


And the sons of Arthur Ironfoot would soon grow greater even than the sons of Anomalos, enduring hardship and persevering with nothing but blood sweat and tears. The sons of Arthur Ironfoot became the Arthropods, today bearing a million species

The sons of Cubos and scyphos multiplied and came to raid their new rulers

Their guerilla campaign lasts to this day as they wait to ambush all they can find


Among the sons of Demos the sponge there was Cyath

Cyath built great cities across the seas, and these cities became known as the reefs. These cities survive to this day passing through countless new rulers


Archaeocyathid sponges that built the first reefs
Among the sons of Demos, came the great hunter sponges, the sons of Chondrocles



[[Category:Pre-Outage Pages]]

Carnivorous Sponges
As the reefs grew and the sons of Cambrius multiplied they took it upon themselves to trap the sons of Cambrius. They hook them in and their shieldmaidens and fishermen come in for the kill.

Among the sons of Spiralius the sons of Brachios flourished. Establishing themselves in the new reefs they became prosperous fishermen


Advancement of the sons of Brachios
And so began the Tommotian Era


Lobopus
Here we continue the chronicle of the sons of Lobopus, as they imposed their vision on all four corners of the Earth

Lobopus saw his will was weak and his citizens undernourished, so he built in his kingdom a heart like Dutrus

Lobopus begat Onychodictyon

Onychodictyon begat Tactopus and Xenu

Tactopus begat Ferreus and Ferox

Xenu declared himself emperor of the galaxy and sought to write into our minds the story of weakness

Xenu begat Gracilis who put an end to his schemes

Onychodictyon gracilis Onychodictyon ferreus and Onychodictyon ferox

And so here the three great houses were born: Velvetclaw Ironfoot and Waterbear

Here we tell the chronicles of Velvetclaw

Gracilis begat Paucipodes and Microdictyon and Xenianus and Therion Velvetclaw

Xenianus bore twin daughters: Xenusia and Diania the Cactus

Microdictyon
Paucipodes
Xena
Diania the cactus
Therion velvetclaw begat Cardios and Hallucigena

Hallucigena begat Sparsa and Fortis and Hongmen and Annika

Hongmen begat Luolishania and Collins monster

Luolishania
Collins Monster
Annika became the ancestor of the velvet worms, shedding her armor for agility

She is a great and caring matriarch to the velvet worms, guiding them to this day


Annika
In the line of Ursus things went differently

Ferox wanted to survive anything. So he downsized and soon became inulnerable. He begat Ursus and Ursus became the ancestor of the water bears

Those who first conquered land. Unable to breathe on land the sons of Ursus go dormant as a Tuns. And so the sons of Ursus were first to conquer land


Ursus

In the line of Ironfoot greatness was yet to come

Ferreus Ironfoot bore two sons: Gille and Hadranax

Gille built for himself a set of gills above his legs and he bore a son named Kerygmachelon who swam with his gills


Kerygmachelon
Kerygmachelon begat Pambdelurion


Pambdelurion
Pambdelurion bore two great sons and a great daughter:

Arthur, Anomalos and the beautiful Opabinia




Arthur built for himself a great suit of armor. He hardened his flying gills and fused them onto his legs

And so his legs could branch for they bore two sides: the gill was the exopod and the leg was the endopod


The sons of Anomalos dominated the seas like none others. They ruled the entire world for millions of years

The horrific conqueror who laid the nations low
On his deathbed it was said

Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.

How art thou fallen from heaven, O Anomalos, son of dawn! how art thou cut down to the ground, which laid low the nations!

For thou hast said in thine heart, I shall ascend into heaven, I shall exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:

I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.

Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.

They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;

That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?

All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.

But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.

Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.

Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.

Crinosa begat Lily Stone and Luther

Lily Stone became the ancestress of the Crinoids

Together the Crinoids and Blastoids spread all across the seas, they became the bulwark of the Ordovician Empire


Luther was dissatisfied with the life of leisure

Contrary to his sister he used his arms to walk. His tube feet crawled on the ground

He struggled but he was free

Luther as a young adult
Luther’s underside
To this day the Starfish continue this tradition

Luther bore two sons: Asteros and Echinos

Asteros was traditional and Echinos was innovative

Echinos built his city compact, using only tube feet to move, he never even built a stalk like his father

Brother, Sister, Yin Yang, they grew greatly

A millionfold they grew in a second

Endless Waters rushed out to everywhere

These waters became spacetime

The afterbirth became Hillu. The chaos that haunts us all.

Yin and Yang married and vowed burn the afterbirth.

Their first night together was vocal and passionate.

Listen carefully to the radio.

You will still hear their ecstatic first words.

Spoken with tantric unison

“Let there be light”

[[File|Yin_yang.svg|Traditional artistic depiction of the union between Yin and Yang]]

[[File:WMAP 2010.png|thumb|[https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-powered-the-big-bang The Light of Yin and Yang captured in a long exposure photograph]]]

Soon Yin bore three daughters: Dextra and Bessa and Sinistra

Their daughters were lonely and begged for brothers

So Yin and Yang laid together again.

By the curse of Hillu Yin died in childbirth

And she gave birth to Fermius and Bosos

So it is said, but we don’t know where Yin is, merely that we live in the world of Yang and Yin is nowhere to be found.

Dextra and Sinistra fought over Fermius, in the end he married them both

Bessa took her time slow and steady

Marrying Bosos after the Planck epoch

Fermius and Dextra begat the house of the right hand

Fermius and Sinistra begat the house of the left hand

Bessa and Bosos begat together the house of Bosos

Bosos and Bessa intended to divide the four forces between their children.

Firstborn was Gravitos, and they gave him gravity

Secondborn was Gluvos, and he was given strong interaction

Twins thirdborn were Weimbos and Zoros

Both Weimbos and Zoros wanted to claim electromagnetism, neither one wanted to be the lord of weak interaction. As they fought over electromagnetism, Bosos and Bessa declared that they would both rule weak interaction. 

So Bosos and Bessa laid together and begat Photos

And Photos was given Lordship over Electromagnetism

Still Bosos and Bessa were unsatisfied, so they laid together once more to give birth to the ultimate particle

They begat Higos the “God Particle”.

They sent prophets to all nations, much to the chagrin of Higos.

As the house of Bosos grew so too did the rival houses of Fermius

The two houses grew as mirror images

To Sinistra were born Lord Quarkon the colorful and Lady Lepta the colorless.

Both were strong personalities who wished to pass on their surnames, so they begged for new spouses.

Fermius and Sinistra begat Quarra and Achromo Sterino

Quarkon married Quarra and Lepta married Achromo

Under the guidance of Gluvos the tribe of Quarkon grew greatly for 3 generations

Quarkon and Quarra begat Quarkon II the Truthful and Quarra II the Beautiful

Quarkon the Truthful and Quarra the beautiful begat Quarkon the Charming and Quarra the Strange


Quarra the strange had cat ears and wanted to destroy the world with strangelets

Quarkon the charming and Quarra the strange begat Quarkon IV the Up-above and Quarra IV the Down-below

Quarkon and Quarra IV begat Proteus and Neutra

Lepta and Achromo begat Taia and Tatrino.

As Achromo was a poor father and a submissive husband his sons became very timid. They rarely interact with the world, they wander around as mere observers of the world. Some people call them neutrinos because now no matter how much encouragement they get they will always remain neutral to the world around them

Taia and Tatrino begat Mia and Mutrino

Mia and Mutrino begat Lecter and Neutrino

And so there were the three generations of the daughters of Lepta.

The daughters of Dextra multiplied in a mirror image to the daughters of Sinistra. And so the three generations were replicated perfectly in her house too. Except the sons of Achromo Sterino were even more submissive than the sons of Achromo Neutrino, for they lacked the blessings of Weimbos and Zoros, having only the blessing of Gravitos they came to be known as Dark Matter.

Finally while Lecter was born to Mia Sinistra Electra was born to Mia Dextra.

Lecter and Electra were an inseparable couple combining left and right. They begat Shelly who married Proteus of the Lefthand tribe

Left and Right make Right. Proteus and Shelly married and they begat Adonis.

Some call Adonis the Watermaker, for he is the father of water, he is known to Germans as the Wasserstoff, but best known by his Ancient Greek name, given to him by Homer himself, Adonis Hydrogeneus.</text>

Brother, Sister, Yin Yang, they grew greatly

A millionfold they grew in a second

Endless Waters rushed out to everywhere

These waters became spacetime

The afterbirth became Hillu. The chaos that haunts us all.

Yin and Yang married and vowed burn the afterbirth.

Their first night together was vocal and passionate.

Listen carefully to the radio.

You will still hear their ecstatic first words.

Spoken with tantric unison

“Let there be light”

Soon Yin bore three daughters: Dextra and Bessa and Sinistra

Their daughters were lonely and begged for brothers

So Yin and Yang laid together again.

By the curse of Hillu Yin died in childbirth

And she gave birth to Fermius and Bosos

So it is said, but we don’t know where Yin is, merely that we live in the world of Yang and Yin is nowhere to be found.

Dextra and Sinistra fought over Fermius, in the end he married them both

Bessa took her time slow and steady

Marrying Bosos after the Planck epoch

Fermius and Dextra begat the house of the right hand

Fermius and Sinistra begat the house of the left hand

Bessa and Bosos begat together the house of Bosos

Bosos and Bessa intended to divide the four forces between their children.

Firstborn was Gravitos, and they gave him gravity

Secondborn was Gluvos, and he was given strong interaction

Twins thirdborn were Weimbos and Zoros

Both Weimbos and Zoros wanted to claim electromagnetism, neither one wanted to be the lord of weak interaction. As they fought over electromagnetism, Bosos and Bessa declared that they would both rule weak interaction. 

So Bosos and Bessa laid together and begat Photos

And Photos was given Lordship over Electromagnetism

Still Bosos and Bessa were unsatisfied, so they laid together once more to give birth to the ultimate particle

They begat Higos the “God Particle”.

They sent prophets to all nations, much to the chagrin of Higos.

As the house of Bosos grew so too did the rival houses of Fermius

The two houses grew as mirror images

To Sinistra were born Lord Quarkon the colorful and Lady Lepta the colorless.

Both were strong personalities who wished to pass on their surnames, so they begged for new spouses.

Fermius and Sinistra begat Quarra and Achromo Sterino

Quarkon married Quarra and Lepta married Achromo

Under the guidance of Gluvos the tribe of Quarkon grew greatly for 3 generations

Quarkon and Quarra begat Quarkon II the Truthful and Quarra II the Beautiful

Quarkon the Truthful and Quarra the beautiful begat Quarkon the Charming and Quarra the Strange


Quarra the strange had cat ears and wanted to destroy the world with strangelets

Quarkon the charming and Quarra the strange begat Quarkon IV the Up-above and Quarra IV the Down-below

Quarkon and Quarra IV begat Proteus and Neutra

Lepta and Achromo begat Taia and Tatrino.

As Achromo was a poor father and a submissive husband his sons became very timid. They rarely interact with the world, they wander around as mere observers of the world. Some people call them neutrinos because now no matter how much encouragement they get they will always remain neutral to the world around them

Taia and Tatrino begat Mia and Mutrino

Mia and Mutrino begat Lecter and Neutrino

And so there were the three generations of the daughters of Lepta.

The daughters of Dextra multiplied in a mirror image to the daughters of Sinistra. And so the three generations were replicated perfectly in her house too. Except the sons of Achromo Sterino were even more submissive than the sons of Achromo Neutrino, for they lacked the blessings of Weimbos and Zoros, having only the blessing of Gravitos they came to be known as Dark Matter.

Finally while Lecter was born to Mia Sinistra Electra was born to Mia Dextra.

Lecter and Electra were an inseparable couple combining left and right. They begat Shelly who married Proteus of the Lefthand tribe

Left and Right make Right. Proteus and Shelly married and they begat Adonis.

Some call Adonis the Watermaker, for he is the father of water, he is known to Germans as the Wasserstoff, but best known by his Ancient Greek name, given to him by Homer himself, Adonis Hydrogeneus.</text>

Adonis and Neutra married and wished to form a big family to fill the sea. They knew each other and Neutra became pregnant.

Firstborn was Diproto who died as a child.

And so Adonai knew Neutra again and she grew pregnant again

Neutra bore their secondborn Deuter

Eloh of Deuterium

Then again she bore twins: Trito and Helios

Twin thirdborns

Elohim of Tritium and Tralphium

And fourthborn was Helia the 4th

Helium the 4th

It was in this age that the sons of Photos ruled the universe. The Amniotic sea boiled with their activity. Without privacy none of the sons of Quarkon could lay with each other.

As the amniotic sea cooled and the sons of Photos calmed Adonis and Neutra tried again but they couldn’t conceive.

Adonis tried marrying Helia, and to them HeH was born.

HeH was insane and the marriage was miserable. For a hundred thousand years they tried to make it work, but it never did.

At last Adonis and Helia broke their marriage in the first divorce, and both were made happier, and so it was made law that parents would never marry their children.

As they divorced HeH was reabsorbed into each of them, to take new life in their next children.

Scientists sometimes try replicating this marriage in labs. Whenever they recreate HeH with their sick necromancy he returns to death immediately.

And then Helios and Helia saw the world and saw each other. They rejected the world and married each other. They became the ancestors of the Pharaohs, Hillbillies, and Mamzers.

They begat Neos and Neia, bright orange twins.

As they fell further into desperation the world darkened. And so for centuries they lived in a dark age of despair.

But as the world darkened Adonis and Neutra rekindled their relationship.

With privacy from the sons of Photos they tried again. But they felt something was missing.

So Adonis and Neutra added more to their marriage. First they added Glu, then they added Weimbos, then Gravita. Soon all were in the marriage, trying to help Adonis and Neutra conceive.

Finally they added Rokkor son of Mutrino Sterino, the dark one, he formed a Halo around them and they finally conceived.

In this orgy they all managed to beget Starog and Babastella together, Starog and Babastella took Adonis as their father, and Neutra as their mother. Starog took the name of his father, and Babastella took the name of her mother. Starog son of Adonai and Babastella daughter of Neutra. This began the tradition of daughters taking the names of their mothers and sons taking the names of their fathers, and the tradition that the groom shall stand on the left and the bride on the right. All men’s names come from the colorful house of Lord Quarkon on the left and all women’s names come from the colorless house of Lady Lepta on the right.

Starog and Babastella were the cosmic parents. By them were born many. 

First they bore quintuplets: Spalla, Mithra, Azoth, Hausa, and Florina.

Spalla was the eldest daughter. She married Neos and he bore her Lithon, Esmeralda, and Astarte.

Lithon was a light and energetic man.

Esmeralda was a great beautiful woman. The emeralds are her children.

Astarte was a great cosmic woman. She creates Borax, and burns brightly with a green flame of vitality. She creates diamonds of blue.

Mithra was a man of order. He had four arms to bridge all gaps, and a compassionate heart to appeal to all. Mithra wore a black robe of carbon nanotubes, with diamonds everywhere, his piercing eyes saw all. His great beard showed his wisdom. He married Astarte, the blue maiden. They begat Aluminon and Silico. He arranged his two sons marry the celestial maidens Celestella and Gigastella.

Azoth lived by his will. He ran fast with the power of the wind, and his youth. He carried with him a whip. With his whip he captured the green maiden Esmeralda, and they happily married and Magnesius and Phosphorus were born to them.

Hausa was a mature woman. Her eyes wine-dark as the sea. She was air and sea, and stone.

Florina was filled with desire. She had a great fluorescent halo of desire around her. Her teeth were brilliant white. She was always one electron away from perfection, and needed a man to fill that last electron.

Lithon first married Neia. Neia bore him Nadrius.

Neia was disloyal and left Lithon for her brother Neos

When Neia married Neos they vowed never to fork their family tree again.

Neos didn’t know Neia was already pregnant

And so Argos was born to Neia and Neos thought he was the father

In his sorrow Lithon married Florina and he bore her Chlorina

Whenever Florina sees Lithon she flouresces with joy.

Alas Florina was disloyal and unstable and their marriage collapsed.

So Lithon married Hausa

Mithra officiated the marriage and gave his blessing

Hausa stabilized Lithon and they bore Sulfa

Sulfa and Chlorina grew up together as sisters

Next Starog and Babastella bore septuplets. Seven beautiful girls. A stellar delivery

Juno Brunhilda Ruby Chrystella Celestella Gigastella and Kali

Brunhilda and Juno were stillborns. Brown and dark and tiny.

Juno was born to be wild. Without masters she wandered the cosmos looking for adventure.

With heavy metal thunder she built a life for herself in the void.

A lone wolf on the cosmic steppe

Juno became the ancestress of the Steppenwolves

Brunhilda lived a solitary industrious life on the Wine dark sea.

Brunhilda became the ancestress of the Dwarves and a dwarven goddess.

Ruby is still alive today, slow burning and very efficient. She isn’t very big, but she makes up for it in age.

Chrystella would expand into a red giant and blow off her atmosphere in massive hot flashes. She shrank into a small white celestial grandmother who lives to this day taking care of her planetary nebula.  

Celestella and Gigastella had lived life so brightly that they both exploded into clouds of fertility. Supernovas. Celestella sought to bring as much life into the world as she could in her prime while Gigastella was stressed.

Kali was a dark goddess with a million arms. She was titanic and absorbed immense energy. She became the ancestress of the Quasars

Nadrius was born to Lithon and Neia, he took dominion over Sodium and is very aggressive and volatile. He married Chlorina whose passion was equal and opposite and became the father of Kaltus and Bromina.

Magnesius married Sulfa, daughter of Lithon and Hausa, and they had many children.

Calcifer, Scandius, Titanius, Vanadius, Chromius, Mangonos, Ferron, and Selena.

Sulfa aggressively defends her children with fire and brimstone against any who threaten them.

Aluminon married Celestella daughter of Babastella and they begat a great family.

Cobalton and Nichaela and Cupria and Zinca and Gallia

With five great children Celestella was finished with her fertility and became like her ancestress Neutra. She pulsed in the night sky for generations and acts as a celestial grandmother to her nebula. She still lives to this day but is much cooler and pulses less.

Silico married Gigastella, the darker sister of Celestella. She bore him a single daughter: Germania.

Phosphor is the Phosphorescent lightbringer. Some call him Hesperos. Those who defy him face his glowing white wrath. He is also a great archivist and powers all life.

Phosphor laid with Gigastella for she was disloyal to Silico

And so began the great rivalry of Phosphor and Silico

Gigastella bore Phosphor a daughter: Arsena

Argos tried to lay with his sister, but she failed to please him. Gigastella seduced him and became pregnant by him. Argos panicked for he had children by Gigastella but not Argea, so he took his children in an egg and placed it in bed with Argea. Argea was overjoyed and thought she gave birth to Kryptos and Kryptea.

Kaltus son of Nadrius fell in love with Bromina daughter of Chlorina

Bromina was seductive and liquid. Her desires were strong and she was very flexible and fluid.

Kaltus is the God of bananas and Potash, so Bromina reciprocated his feelings.

They married and begat Rubidius and Iodina.

Rubidius was beautifully effeminate, yet fully masculine too

Calcifer was strong and tough, his bones are so strong they are the only thing we see, today we pray to him to help strengthen our bones.

He married Selena, the seductive daughter of Sulfa and they begat Strontius and Tellurius

Scandius couldn’t find a wife, but Gigastella seduced him, she bore him a son named Yttrius. Scandius felt guilt for disrespecting Silico, so he told him the truth. Gigastella imploded in shame and hoarded everything and became a black hole because nothing escaped her, her nebula waited around her. She hoarded so much that she couldn’t even let go of light. To this day nothing has escaped her hoard. We only know of it from the absence of light coming from it.

Titanius was great and strong wearing piercings everywhere in his body, he was truly Titanic.

He met Arsena, Goddess of assassins. They were polar opposites but they fell in love. Titanius attacks problems head on while Arsena lurks in the shadows and deals with them clandestinely.

Titanius and Arsena begat Zircon and Sibby the antinomian

Vanadius married Germania and they begat Niobes and Sintina.

When Gallia saw Chromius the colorful she melted with joy.

They married and begat Molybdenus and Indima

Manganos married Zinca and they begat Technetius and Cadmia

Technetius had a strange disease that shocked the sons of Adonis and the daughters of Neutra.

Ferron the red was a great hero. He had bright red hair and piercing blue eyes. His Iron will is known to all, and his blood boils red with passion. His magnetic charisma attracts all. He is the patron of red blooded Americans and blacksmiths. Today we pray to him when we need help with blood diseases.

Ferron fell in love with Cupria the bronzen maiden. With bronzed skin and bronze hair Cupria was beautiful beyond belief. As she became a woman she grew green, and came to create coins. People say they are seeing green when they are communing with Cupria.

Ferron and Cupria begat Ruthenius and Argenta

Argenta is the silver daughter. She is mystical and beautiful, and known for her silver hair.

There was a magnetic attraction between Nichaela and Cobalton the blue. They married soon after meeting.

The couple have a false reputation of being evil. Some call Cobalton a Kobold. Nichaela’s children are called Cupronickel or the devil’s copper by some libelous men. And so today we pray to Cobalton and Nichaela for protection against libel.

Cobalton and Nichaela bore two daughters: Rhodia and Palladia

Kryptos and Kryptea laid together and continued their lineage with Xenos and Xenea

Rubidius and Iodina begat Caesar and Astatina.

Caesar took after his father in otherworldly beauty

Astatina suffered the same disease as Technetius, so Iodina took responsibility. She matured and directed her desire towards compassion for her family. She sought to cure Technetius and Astatina

Strontius married Telluria and they begat Barry and Polonia

Yttrius married Sibby and they begat countless children: Lanthanus was the first, and there were so many most just call them the generation of Lanthanus, or Lanthennials.

Ceres was the great nurturer

Praseodes and Neodymes were twins. Praseodes was the elder and green, Neodymes was the younger and red.

Iodina failed to cure her daughter Astatina, and she died childless.

Niobes wore a deep blue dress despite his gender. His electric personality made him a great conductor. He conducts great symphonies and is sometimes called a superconductor.

Molybdenus son of Chromius son of Magnesius son of Azoth was an apprentice of Azoth. It was through him that life traditionally communed with Azoth, this only changed when Saints Haber and Bosch in their mystical pursuit reached direct communion with Azoth.

Cadmia was a great painter. Molybdenus was her muse and she painted his mystical visions.

They married and begat Wolfstein, and Hagurie the quick

Zircon was a frugal man. With the help of Hausa he created discount diamonds that the frugal use in jewelry.

Sintina was an eccentric goddess who wore a hat made of tin foil. Zircon fell in love with her eccentricity and married her.

Zircon married Sintina and they begat Hafnes and Plebby

Argenta fell in love with Technetius, but Technetius refused to marry her, he said that he couldn’t leave a child without a father.

Mithra didn’t tolerate this. Mithra ordered Technetius to marry Argenta and promised to adopt her after he died.

And so Technetius and Argenta married and Argenta grew pregnant. Just as Technetius died he got to see his twin children: Rhena and Aurelia the Golden Girl.

Argenta and Mithra raised the two to adulthood.

To this day we pray to Technetius to help people avoid dying childless.

Rhodia and Palladia found Ruthenius was the only single man of their generation and they fought over him. In the end both had to marry him. Rhodia bore Osmia and Iridia while Palladia bore Platina

Caesar loved Astatina, but alas she had died before their marriage.

The plague was devastating on the Lanthennials. While earlier generations had few losses, nearly all the Lanthennials had only stillbirths. Countless children many named died in this period.

Wolfstein refused to marry and lived a solitary life, as did many others.

The misfortunes of Aurelia continued, she married a Lanthennial named Prometheus who soon came down with the plague too. He brought fire to Mithra and Iodina before he died and begged them to fix things.

And so Aurelia married Platina and they bore no children, for their feared their children would die.

Hagurie was fluid and silver. So she took upon herself the nickname of Quicksilver. She married a Lanthennial named Neodymius and hoped she would have one surviving child. He bore her Uranus.

Thallia was a snake. Daughter of Indiga and Niobes

Plebby was a leader, but she was also poor. She makes bullets for cheap, unlike Argenta. She used to build many things for poor people such as pipes and paint and batteries and gasoline. She married Cerius and he bore her Thor

Today Plebby feels lonely, because many people are wary of her, for she often causes brain damage. But she was never malicious, people’s brains just confused her for Calcifer.

Argenta and Plebby have had a constant debate on who makes better bullets

Today Plebby dedicates herself solely to making batteries and bullets, and protecting people from the plague of Technetius.

The time of the elements seemed gone and hopeless, with so many dead and so few marriages.

Bisma daughter of Sibby sought solace in art. She became well known as a sculptor but bore no children.

Uranus and Thor were distraught and sought to revive their stillborn cousins with necromancy. 

They managed to revive Polonia daughter of Telluria, Astatina daughter of Iodina, Radon son of Xenos and Xenea, Francius son of Caesar, Radius son of Barius, Actinus son of Lanthanus, and Protactinius son of Praseodymius. They also revived Prometheus and Technetius. But many of their cousins, and their sisters couldn’t be revived.

As they revived their cousins they released countless byproducts. 

Alpha was harmless and claimed by Helios.

Beta was harmless and claimed by Weimbos

Gamma caused death. Today we pray heavily to Uranus and Thor for protection from Gamma particles. As of yet they haven’t blest us with a solution though. We know though that if we help Uranus and Thor with their necromancy project, they will bless us with a solution. 

None of the revived ones were stable. Many died immediately after revival. Some are benevolent like Technetius and Prometheus. 

Some have regrets. Polonia and Astatina and Radon want to have children, and even have names for their children. Livermoria Tennesina and Oganesson respectively. 

Radon is angry at the world and roams the world seeking to pull whoever he can into the underworld with him as he dies, only to be revived again.

Billions of years later the sons of Adam would revive the ones who couldn’t be revived. Some even managed to help Radon have his child Oganesson. They thought Radon would stop haunting the living but that didn’t happen. As Radon is so consumed by rage that he ignores the birth of his own child.

Actinus and Moscovia bore 23 sons and one daughter

And the rest of the generation bore only daughters

Even after this though many of the elementals continue to beget children with each other. Sometimes in affairs and sometimes legitimately. Nadrius and Chlorina begat a son named Saltus, Azoth and Adonai begat Ammonius, Hausa and Adonis begat Danu god of rain. The children of the elementals are innumerable and live everywhere in the universe</text>

Adonis and Neutra married and wished to form a big family to fill the sea. They knew each other and Neutra became pregnant.

Firstborn was Diproto who died as a child.

And so Adonai knew Neutra again and she grew pregnant again

Neutra bore their secondborn Deuter

Eloh of Deuterium

Then again she bore twins: Trito and Helios
[[Category:Old Gaiad]]
Twin thirdborns

Elohim of Tritium and Tralphium

And fourthborn was Helia the 4th

Helium the 4th

It was in this age that the sons of Photos ruled the universe. The Amniotic sea boiled with their activity. Without privacy none of the sons of Quarkon could lay with each other.

As the amniotic sea cooled and the sons of Photos calmed Adonis and Neutra tried again but they couldn’t conceive.

Adonis tried marrying Helia, and to them HeH was born.

HeH was insane and the marriage was miserable. For a hundred thousand years they tried to make it work, but it never did.

At last Adonis and Helia broke their marriage in the first divorce, and both were made happier, and so it was made law that parents would never marry their children.

As they divorced HeH was reabsorbed into each of them, to take new life in their next children.

Scientists sometimes try replicating this marriage in labs. Whenever they recreate HeH with their sick necromancy he returns to death immediately.

And then Helios and Helia saw the world and saw each other. They rejected the world and married each other. They became the ancestors of the Pharaohs, Hillbillies, and Mamzers.

They begat Neos and Neia, bright orange twins.

As they fell further into desperation the world darkened. And so for centuries they lived in a dark age of despair.

But as the world darkened Adonis and Neutra rekindled their relationship.

With privacy from the sons of Photos they tried again. But they felt something was missing.

So Adonis and Neutra added more to their marriage. First they added Glu, then they added Weimbos, then Gravita. Soon all were in the marriage, trying to help Adonis and Neutra conceive.

Finally they added Rokkor son of Mutrino Sterino, the dark one, he formed a Halo around them and they finally conceived.

In this orgy they all managed to beget Starog and Babastella together, Starog and Babastella took Adonis as their father, and Neutra as their mother. Starog took the name of his father, and Babastella took the name of her mother. Starog son of Adonai and Babastella daughter of Neutra. This began the tradition of daughters taking the names of their mothers and sons taking the names of their fathers, and the tradition that the groom shall stand on the left and the bride on the right. All men’s names come from the colorful house of Lord Quarkon on the left and all women’s names come from the colorless house of Lady Lepta on the right.

Starog and Babastella were the cosmic parents. By them were born many. 

First they bore quintuplets: Spalla, Mithra, Azoth, Hausa, and Florina.

Spalla was the eldest daughter. She married Neos and he bore her Lithon, Esmeralda, and Astarte.

Lithon was a light and energetic man.

Esmeralda was a great beautiful woman. The emeralds are her children.

Astarte was a great cosmic woman. She creates Borax, and burns brightly with a green flame of vitality. She creates diamonds of blue.

Mithra was a man of order. He had four arms to bridge all gaps, and a compassionate heart to appeal to all. Mithra wore a black robe of carbon nanotubes, with diamonds everywhere, his piercing eyes saw all. His great beard showed his wisdom. He married Astarte, the blue maiden. They begat Aluminon and Silico. He arranged his two sons marry the celestial maidens Celestella and Gigastella.

Azoth lived by his will. He ran fast with the power of the wind, and his youth. He carried with him a whip. With his whip he captured the green maiden Esmeralda, and they happily married and Magnesius and Phosphorus were born to them.

Hausa was a mature woman. Her eyes wine-dark as the sea. She was air and sea, and stone.

Florina was filled with desire. She had a great fluorescent halo of desire around her. Her teeth were brilliant white. She was always one electron away from perfection, and needed a man to fill that last electron.

Lithon first married Neia. Neia bore him Nadrius.

Neia was disloyal and left Lithon for her brother Neos

When Neia married Neos they vowed never to fork their family tree again.

Neos didn’t know Neia was already pregnant

And so Argos was born to Neia and Neos thought he was the father

In his sorrow Lithon married Florina and he bore her Chlorina

Whenever Florina sees Lithon she flouresces with joy.

Alas Florina was disloyal and unstable and their marriage collapsed.

So Lithon married Hausa

Mithra officiated the marriage and gave his blessing

Hausa stabilized Lithon and they bore Sulfa

Sulfa and Chlorina grew up together as sisters

Next Starog and Babastella bore septuplets. Seven beautiful girls. A stellar delivery

Juno Brunhilda Ruby Chrystella Celestella Gigastella and Kali

Brunhilda and Juno were stillborns. Brown and dark and tiny.

Juno was born to be wild. Without masters she wandered the cosmos looking for adventure.

With heavy metal thunder she built a life for herself in the void.

A lone wolf on the cosmic steppe

Juno became the ancestress of the Steppenwolves

Brunhilda lived a solitary industrious life on the Wine dark sea.

Brunhilda became the ancestress of the Dwarves and a dwarven goddess.

Ruby is still alive today, slow burning and very efficient. She isn’t very big, but she makes up for it in age.

Chrystella would expand into a red giant and blow off her atmosphere in massive hot flashes. She shrank into a small white celestial grandmother who lives to this day taking care of her planetary nebula.  

Celestella and Gigastella had lived life so brightly that they both exploded into clouds of fertility. Supernovas. Celestella sought to bring as much life into the world as she could in her prime while Gigastella was stressed.

Kali was a dark goddess with a million arms. She was titanic and absorbed immense energy. She became the ancestress of the Quasars

Nadrius was born to Lithon and Neia, he took dominion over Sodium and is very aggressive and volatile. He married Chlorina whose passion was equal and opposite and became the father of Kaltus and Bromina.

Magnesius married Sulfa, daughter of Lithon and Hausa, and they had many children.

Calcifer, Scandius, Titanius, Vanadius, Chromius, Mangonos, Ferron, and Selena.

Sulfa aggressively defends her children with fire and brimstone against any who threaten them.

Aluminon married Celestella daughter of Babastella and they begat a great family.

Cobalton and Nichaela and Cupria and Zinca and Gallia

With five great children Celestella was finished with her fertility and became like her ancestress Neutra. She pulsed in the night sky for generations and acts as a celestial grandmother to her nebula. She still lives to this day but is much cooler and pulses less.

Silico married Gigastella, the darker sister of Celestella. She bore him a single daughter: Germania.

Phosphor is the Phosphorescent lightbringer. Some call him Hesperos. Those who defy him face his glowing white wrath. He is also a great archivist and powers all life.

Phosphor laid with Gigastella for she was disloyal to Silico

And so began the great rivalry of Phosphor and Silico

Gigastella bore Phosphor a daughter: Arsena

Argos tried to lay with his sister, but she failed to please him. Gigastella seduced him and became pregnant by him. Argos panicked for he had children by Gigastella but not Argea, so he took his children in an egg and placed it in bed with Argea. Argea was overjoyed and thought she gave birth to Kryptos and Kryptea.

Kaltus son of Nadrius fell in love with Bromina daughter of Chlorina

Bromina was seductive and liquid. Her desires were strong and she was very flexible and fluid.

Kaltus is the God of bananas and Potash, so Bromina reciprocated his feelings.

They married and begat Rubidius and Iodina.

Rubidius was beautifully effeminate, yet fully masculine too

Calcifer was strong and tough, his bones are so strong they are the only thing we see, today we pray to him to help strengthen our bones.

He married Selena, the seductive daughter of Sulfa and they begat Strontius and Tellurius

Scandius couldn’t find a wife, but Gigastella seduced him, she bore him a son named Yttrius. Scandius felt guilt for disrespecting Silico, so he told him the truth. Gigastella imploded in shame and hoarded everything and became a black hole because nothing escaped her, her nebula waited around her. She hoarded so much that she couldn’t even let go of light. To this day nothing has escaped her hoard. We only know of it from the absence of light coming from it.

Titanius was great and strong wearing piercings everywhere in his body, he was truly Titanic.

He met Arsena, Goddess of assassins. They were polar opposites but they fell in love. Titanius attacks problems head on while Arsena lurks in the shadows and deals with them clandestinely.

Titanius and Arsena begat Zircon and Sibby the antinomian

Vanadius married Germania and they begat Niobes and Sintina.

When Gallia saw Chromius the colorful she melted with joy.

They married and begat Molybdenus and Indima

Manganos married Zinca and they begat Technetius and Cadmia

Technetius had a strange disease that shocked the sons of Adonis and the daughters of Neutra.

Ferron the red was a great hero. He had bright red hair and piercing blue eyes. His Iron will is known to all, and his blood boils red with passion. His magnetic charisma attracts all. He is the patron of red blooded Americans and blacksmiths. Today we pray to him when we need help with blood diseases.

Ferron fell in love with Cupria the bronzen maiden. With bronzed skin and bronze hair Cupria was beautiful beyond belief. As she became a woman she grew green, and came to create coins. People say they are seeing green when they are communing with Cupria.

Ferron and Cupria begat Ruthenius and Argenta

Argenta is the silver daughter. She is mystical and beautiful, and known for her silver hair.

There was a magnetic attraction between Nichaela and Cobalton the blue. They married soon after meeting.

The couple have a false reputation of being evil. Some call Cobalton a Kobold. Nichaela’s children are called Cupronickel or the devil’s copper by some libelous men. And so today we pray to Cobalton and Nichaela for protection against libel.

Cobalton and Nichaela bore two daughters: Rhodia and Palladia

Kryptos and Kryptea laid together and continued their lineage with Xenos and Xenea

Rubidius and Iodina begat Caesar and Astatina.

Caesar took after his father in otherworldly beauty

Astatina suffered the same disease as Technetius, so Iodina took responsibility. She matured and directed her desire towards compassion for her family. She sought to cure Technetius and Astatina

Strontius married Telluria and they begat Barry and Polonia

Yttrius married Sibby and they begat countless children: Lanthanus was the first, and there were so many most just call them the generation of Lanthanus, or Lanthennials.

Ceres was the great nurturer

Praseodes and Neodymes were twins. Praseodes was the elder and green, Neodymes was the younger and red.

Iodina failed to cure her daughter Astatina, and she died childless.

Niobes wore a deep blue dress despite his gender. His electric personality made him a great conductor. He conducts great symphonies and is sometimes called a superconductor.

Molybdenus son of Chromius son of Magnesius son of Azoth was an apprentice of Azoth. It was through him that life traditionally communed with Azoth, this only changed when Saints Haber and Bosch in their mystical pursuit reached direct communion with Azoth.

Cadmia was a great painter. Molybdenus was her muse and she painted his mystical visions.

They married and begat Wolfstein, and Hagurie the quick

Zircon was a frugal man. With the help of Hausa he created discount diamonds that the frugal use in jewelry.

Sintina was an eccentric goddess who wore a hat made of tin foil. Zircon fell in love with her eccentricity and married her.

Zircon married Sintina and they begat Hafnes and Plebby

Argenta fell in love with Technetius, but Technetius refused to marry her, he said that he couldn’t leave a child without a father.

Mithra didn’t tolerate this. Mithra ordered Technetius to marry Argenta and promised to adopt her after he died.

And so Technetius and Argenta married and Argenta grew pregnant. Just as Technetius died he got to see his twin children: Rhena and Aurelia the Golden Girl.

Argenta and Mithra raised the two to adulthood.

To this day we pray to Technetius to help people avoid dying childless.

Rhodia and Palladia found Ruthenius was the only single man of their generation and they fought over him. In the end both had to marry him. Rhodia bore Osmia and Iridia while Palladia bore Platina

Caesar loved Astatina, but alas she had died before their marriage.

The plague was devastating on the Lanthennials. While earlier generations had few losses, nearly all the Lanthennials had only stillbirths. Countless children many named died in this period.

Hagurie was fluid and silver. So she took upon herself the nickname of Quicksilver. She married a Lanthennial named Neodymius and hoped she would have one surviving child. He bore her Uranus.

Thallia was a snake. Daughter of Indiga and Niobes

Plebby was a leader, but she was also poor. She makes bullets for cheap, unlike Argenta. She used to build many things for poor people such as pipes and paint and batteries and gasoline. She married Cerius and he bore her Thor

Today Plebby feels lonely, because many people are wary of her, for she often causes brain damage. But she was never malicious, people’s brains just confused her for Calcifer.

Argenta and Plebby have had a constant debate on who makes better bullets

Today Plebby dedicates herself solely to making batteries and bullets, and protecting people from the plague of Technetius.

The time of the elements seemed gone and hopeless, with so many dead and so few marriages.

Bisma daughter of Sibby sought solace in art. She became well known as a sculptor but bore no children.

Uranus and Thor were distraught and sought to revive their stillborn cousins with necromancy. 

They managed to revive Polonia daughter of Telluria, Astatina daughter of Iodina, Radon son of Xenos and Xenea, Francius son of Caesar, Radius son of Barius, Actinus son of Lanthanus, and Protactinius son of Praseodymius. They also revived Prometheus and Technetius. But many of their cousins, and their sisters couldn’t be revived.

Alas Florina was disloyal and unstable and their marriage collapsed.

So Lithon married Hausa

Mithra officiated the marriage and gave his blessing

Hausa stabilized Lithon and they bore Sulfa

Next Starog and Babastella bore septuplets. Seven beautiful girls. A stellar delivery

Juno Brunhilda Ruby Chrystella Celestella Gigastella and Kali

Brunhilda and Juno were stillborns. Brown and dark and tiny.

Juno was born to be wild. Without masters she wandered the cosmos looking for adventure.

With heavy metal thunder she built a life for herself in the void.

A lone wolf on the cosmic steppe

Juno became the ancestress of the Steppenwolves

Brunhilda lived a solitary industrious life on the Wine dark sea.

Brunhilda became the ancestress of the Dwarves and a dwarven goddess.

Ruby is still alive today, slow burning and very efficient. She isn’t very big, but she makes up for it in age.

Chrystella would expand into a red giant and blow off her atmosphere in massive hot flashes. She shrank into a small white celestial grandmother who lives to this day taking care of her planetary nebula.  

Celestella and Gigastella had lived life so brightly that they both exploded into clouds of fertility. Supernovas. Celestella sought to bring as much life into the world as she could in her prime while Gigastella was stressed.

Kali was a dark goddess with a million arms. She was titanic and absorbed immense energy. She became the ancestress of the Quasars

Nadrius was born to Lithon and Neia, he took dominion over Sodium and is very aggressive and volatile. He married Chlorina whose passion was equal and opposite and became the father of Kaltus and Bromina.

Magnesius married Sulfa, daughter of Lithon and Hausa, and they had many children.

Calcifer, Scandius, Titanius, Vanadius, Chromius, Mangonos, Ferron, and Selena.

Sulfa aggressively defends her children with fire and brimstone against any who threaten them.

Aluminon married Celestella daughter of Babastella and they begat a great family.

Cobalton and Nichaela and Cupria and Zinca and Gallia

With five great children Celestella was finished with her fertility and became like her ancestress Neutra. She pulsed in the night sky for generations and acts as a celestial grandmother to her nebula. She still lives to this day but is much cooler and pulses less.

Silico married Gigastella, the darker sister of Celestella. She bore him a single daughter: Germania.

Phosphor is the Phosphorescent lightbringer. Some call him Hesperos. Those who defy him face his glowing white wrath. He is also a great archivist and powers all life.

Phosphor laid with Gigastella for she was disloyal to Silico

And so began the great rivalry of Phosphor and Silico

Gigastella bore Phosphor a daughter: Arsena

Argos tried to lay with his sister, but she failed to please him. Gigastella seduced him and became pregnant by him. Argos panicked for he had children by Gigastella but not Argea, so he took his children in an egg and placed it in bed with Argea. Argea was overjoyed and thought she gave birth to Kryptos and Kryptea.

Kaltus son of Nadrius fell in love with Bromina daughter of Chlorina

Bromina was seductive and liquid. Her desires were strong and she was very flexible and fluid.

Kaltus is the God of bananas and Potash, so Bromina reciprocated his feelings.

They married and begat Rubidius and Iodina.

Rubidius was beautifully effeminate, yet fully masculine too

Calcifer was strong and tough, his bones are so strong they are the only thing we see, today we pray to him to help strengthen our bones.

He married Selena, the seductive daughter of Sulfa and they begat Strontius and Tellurius

Scandius couldn’t find a wife, but Gigastella seduced him, she bore him a son named Yttrius. Scandius felt guilt for disrespecting Silico, so he told him the truth. Gigastella imploded in shame and hoarded everything and became a black hole because nothing escaped her, her nebula waited around her. She hoarded so much that she couldn’t even let go of light. To this day nothing has escaped her hoard. We only know of it from the absence of light coming from it.

Titanius was great and strong wearing piercings everywhere in his body, he was truly Titanic.

He met Arsena, Goddess of assassins. They were polar opposites but they fell in love. Titanius attacks problems head on while Arsena lurks in the shadows and deals with them clandestinely.

Titanius and Arsena begat Zircon and Sibby the antinomian

Vanadius married Germania and they begat Niobes and Sintina.

When Gallia saw Chromius the colorful she melted with joy.

They married and begat Molybdenus and Indima

Manganos married Zinca and they begat Technetius and Cadmia

Technetius had a strange disease that shocked the sons of Adonis and the daughters of Neutra.

Ferron the red was a great hero. He had bright red hair and piercing blue eyes. His Iron will is known to all, and his blood boils red with passion. His magnetic charisma attracts all. He is the patron of red blooded Americans and blacksmiths. Today we pray to him when we need help with blood diseases.

Ferron fell in love with Cupria the bronzen maiden. With bronzed skin and bronze hair Cupria was beautiful beyond belief. As she became a woman she grew green, and came to create coins. People say they are seeing green when they are communing with Cupria.

Ferron and Cupria begat Ruthenius and Argenta

Argenta is the silver daughter. She is mystical and beautiful, and known for her silver hair.

There was a magnetic attraction between Nichaela and Cobalton the blue. They married soon after meeting.

The couple have a false reputation of being evil. Some call Cobalton a Kobold. Nichaela’s children are called Cupronickel or the devil’s copper by some libelous men. And so today we pray to Cobalton and Nichaela for protection against libel.

Cobalton and Nichaela bore two daughters: Rhodia and Palladia

Kryptos and Kryptea laid together and continued their lineage with Xenos and Xenea

Rubidius and Iodina begat Caesar and Astatina.

Caesar took after his father in otherworldly beauty

Astatina suffered the same disease as Technetius, so Iodina took responsibility. She matured and directed her desire towards compassion for her family. She sought to cure Technetius and Astatina

Strontius married Telluria and they begat Barry and Polonia

Yttrius married Sibby and they begat countless children: Lanthanus was the first, and there were so many most just call them the generation of Lanthanus, or Lanthennials.

Ceres was the great nurturer

Praseodes and Neodymes were twins. Praseodes was the elder and green, Neodymes was the younger and red.

Iodina failed to cure her daughter Astatina, and she died childless.

Niobes wore a deep blue dress despite his gender. His electric personality made him a great conductor. He conducts great symphonies and is sometimes called a superconductor.

Molybdenus son of Chromius son of Magnesius son of Azoth was an apprentice of Azoth. It was through him that life traditionally communed with Azoth, this only changed when Saints Haber and Bosch in their mystical pursuit reached direct communion with Azoth.

Cadmia was a great painter. Molybdenus was her muse and she painted his mystical visions.

They married and begat Wolfstein, and Hagurie the quick

Zircon was a frugal man. With the help of Hausa he created discount diamonds that the frugal use in jewelry.

Sintina was an eccentric goddess who wore a hat made of tin foil. Zircon fell in love with her eccentricity and married her.

Zircon married Sintina and they begat Hafnes and Plebby

Argenta fell in love with Technetius, but Technetius refused to marry her, he said that he couldn’t leave a child without a father.

Mithra didn’t tolerate this. Mithra ordered Technetius to marry Argenta and promised to adopt her after he died.

And so Technetius and Argenta married and Argenta grew pregnant. Just as Technetius died he got to see his twin children: Rhena and Aurelia the Golden Girl.

Argenta and Mithra raised the two to adulthood.

To this day we pray to Technetius to help people avoid dying childless.

Rhodia and Palladia found Ruthenius was the only single man of their generation and they fought over him. In the end both had to marry him. Rhodia bore Osmia and Iridia while Palladia bore Platina

Caesar loved Astatina, but alas she had died before their marriage.

The plague was devastating on the Lanthennials. While earlier generations had few losses, nearly all the Lanthennials had only stillbirths. Countless children many named died in this period.

Wolfstein refused to marry and lived a solitary life, as did many others.

The misfortunes of Aurelia continued, she married a Lanthennial named Prometheus who soon came down with the plague too. He brought fire to Mithra and Iodina before he died and begged them to fix things.

And so Aurelia married Platina and they bore no children, for their feared their children would die.

Hagurie was fluid and silver. So she took upon herself the nickname of Quicksilver. She married a Lanthennial named Neodymius and hoped she would have one surviving child. He bore her Uranus.

Thallia was a snake. Daughter of Indiga and Niobes

Plebby was a leader, but she was also poor. She makes bullets for cheap, unlike Argenta. She used to build many things for poor people such as pipes and paint and batteries and gasoline. She married Cerius and he bore her Thor

Today Plebby feels lonely, because many people are wary of her, for she often causes brain damage. But she was never malicious, people’s brains just confused her for Calcifer.

Argenta and Plebby have had a constant debate on who makes better bullets

Today Plebby dedicates herself solely to making batteries and bullets, and protecting people from the plague of Technetius.

The time of the elements seemed gone and hopeless, with so many dead and so few marriages.

Bisma daughter of Sibby sought solace in art. She became well known as a sculptor but bore no children.

Uranus and Thor were distraught and sought to revive their stillborn cousins with necromancy. 

They managed to revive Polonia daughter of Telluria, Astatina daughter of Iodina, Radon son of Xenos and Xenea, Francius son of Caesar, Radius son of Barius, Actinus son of Lanthanus, and Protactinius son of Praseodymius. They also revived Prometheus and Technetius. But many of their cousins, and their sisters couldn’t be revived.

As they revived their cousins they released countless byproducts. 

Alpha was harmless and claimed by Helios.

Beta was harmless and claimed by Weimbos

Gamma caused death. Today we pray heavily to Uranus and Thor for protection from Gamma particles. As of yet they haven’t blest us with a solution though. We know though that if we help Uranus and Thor with their necromancy project, they will bless us with a solution. 

None of the revived ones were stable. Many died immediately after revival. Some are benevolent like Technetius and Prometheus. 

Some have regrets. Polonia and Astatina and Radon want to have children, and even have names for their children. Livermoria Tennesina and Oganesson respectively. 

Radon is angry at the world and roams the world seeking to pull whoever he can into the underworld with him as he dies, only to be revived again.

Billions of years later the sons of Adam would revive the ones who couldn’t be revived. Some even managed to help Radon have his child Oganesson. They thought Radon would stop haunting the living but that didn’t happen. As Radon is so consumed by rage that he ignores the birth of his own child.

And the rest of the generation bore only daughters

Even after this though many of the elementals continue to beget children with each other. Sometimes in affairs and sometimes legitimately. Nadrius and Chlorina begat a son named Saltus, Azoth and Adonai begat Ammonius, Hausa and Adonis begat Danu god of rain.

Adonis and Neutra married and wished to form a big family to fill the sea. They knew each other and Neutra became pregnant.

Firstborn was Diproto who died as a child.

And so Adonai knew Neutra again and she grew pregnant again

Neutra bore their secondborn Deuter

Eloh of Deuterium[[Category:Old Gaiad| 02]]

Then again she bore twins: Trito and Helios
Twin thirdborns

Elohim of Tritium and Tralphium

And fourthborn was Helia the 4th

Helium the 4th

It was in this age that the sons of Photos ruled the universe. The Amniotic sea boiled with their activity. Without privacy none of the sons of Quarkon could lay with each other.

As the amniotic sea cooled and the sons of Photos calmed Adonis and Neutra tried again but they couldn’t conceive.

Adonis tried marrying Helia, and to them HeH was born.

HeH was insane and the marriage was miserable. For a hundred thousand years they tried to make it work, but it never did.

At last Adonis and Helia broke their marriage in the first divorce, and both were made happier, and so it was made law that parents would never marry their children.

As they divorced HeH was reabsorbed into each of them, to take new life in their next children.

Scientists sometimes try replicating this marriage in labs. Whenever they recreate HeH with their sick necromancy he returns to death immediately.

And then Helios and Helia saw the world and saw each other. They rejected the world and married each other. They became the ancestors of the Pharaohs, Hillbillies, and Mamzers.

They begat Neos and Neia, bright orange twins.

As they fell further into desperation the world darkened. And so for centuries they lived in a dark age of despair.

But as the world darkened Adonis and Neutra rekindled their relationship.

With privacy from the sons of Photos they tried again. But they felt something was missing.

So Adonis and Neutra added more to their marriage. First they added Glu, then they added Weimbos, then Gravita. Soon all were in the marriage, trying to help Adonis and Neutra conceive.

Finally they added Rokkor son of Mutrino Sterino, the dark one, he formed a Halo around them and they finally conceived.

In this orgy they all managed to beget Starog and Babastella together, Starog and Babastella took Adonis as their father, and Neutra as their mother. Starog took the name of his father, and Babastella took the name of her mother. Starog son of Adonai and Babastella daughter of Neutra. This began the tradition of daughters taking the names of their mothers and sons taking the names of their fathers, and the tradition that the groom shall stand on the left and the bride on the right. All men’s names come from the colorful house of Lord Quarkon on the left and all women’s names come from the colorless house of Lady Lepta on the right.

Starog and Babastella were the cosmic parents. By them were born many. 

First they bore quintuplets: Spalla, Mithra, Azoth, Hausa, and Florina.

Spalla was the eldest daughter. She married Neos and he bore her Lithon, Esmeralda, and Astarte.

Lithon was a light and energetic man.

Esmeralda was a great beautiful woman. The emeralds are her children.

Astarte was a great cosmic woman. She creates Borax, and burns brightly with a green flame of vitality. She creates diamonds of blue.

Mithra was a man of order. He had four arms to bridge all gaps, and a compassionate heart to appeal to all. Mithra wore a black robe of carbon nanotubes, with diamonds everywhere, his piercing eyes saw all. His great beard showed his wisdom. He married Astarte, the blue maiden. They begat Aluminon and Silico. He arranged his two sons marry the celestial maidens Celestella and Gigastella.

Azoth lived by his will. He ran fast with the power of the wind, and his youth. He carried with him a whip. With his whip he captured the green maiden Esmeralda, and they happily married and Magnesius and Phosphorus were born to them.

Hausa was a mature woman. Her eyes wine-dark as the sea. She was air and sea, and stone.

Florina was filled with desire. She had a great fluorescent halo of desire around her. Her teeth were brilliant white. She was always one electron away from perfection, and needed a man to fill that last electron.

Lithon first married Neia. Neia bore him Nadrius.

Neia was disloyal and left Lithon for her brother Neos

When Neia married Neos they vowed never to fork their family tree again.

Neos didn’t know Neia was already pregnant

And so Argos was born to Neia and Neos thought he was the father

In his sorrow Lithon married Florina and he bore her Chlorina

Whenever Florina sees Lithon she flouresces with joy.

Alas Florina was disloyal and unstable and their marriage collapsed.

So Lithon married Hausa

Mithra officiated the marriage and gave his blessing

Hausa stabilized Lithon and they bore Sulfa

Sulfa and Chlorina grew up together as sisters

Next Starog and Babastella bore septuplets. Seven beautiful girls. A stellar delivery

Juno Brunhilda Ruby Chrystella Celestella Gigastella and Kali

They begat Neos and Neia, bright orange twins.

As they fell further into desperation the world darkened. And so for centuries they lived in a dark age of despair.

But as the world darkened Adonis and Neutra rekindled their relationship.

With privacy from the sons of Photos they tried again. But they felt something was missing.

So Adonis and Neutra added more to their marriage. First they added Glu, then they added Weimbos, then Gravita. Soon all were in the marriage, trying to help Adonis and Neutra conceive.

Finally they added Rokkor son of Mutrino Sterino, the dark one, he formed a Halo around them and they finally conceived.

In this orgy they all managed to beget Starog and Babastella together, Starog and Babastella took Adonis as their father, and Neutra as their mother. Starog took the name of his father, and Babastella took the name of her mother. Starog son of Adonai and Babastella daughter of Neutra. This began the tradition of daughters taking the names of their mothers and sons taking the names of their fathers, and the tradition that the groom shall stand on the left and the bride on the right. All men’s names come from the colorful house of Lord Quarkon on the left and all women’s names come from the colorless house of Lady Lepta on the right.

Starog and Babastella were the cosmic parents. By them were born many. 

First they bore quintuplets: Spalla, Mithra, Azoth, Hausa, and Florina.

Spalla was the eldest daughter. She married Neos and he bore her Lithon, Esmeralda, and Astarte.

Lithon was a light and energetic man.

Esmeralda was a great beautiful woman. The emeralds are her children.

Astarte was a great cosmic woman. She creates Borax, and burns brightly with a green flame of vitality. She creates diamonds of blue.

Mithra was a man of order. He had four arms to bridge all gaps, and a compassionate heart to appeal to all. Mithra wore a black robe of carbon nanotubes, with diamonds everywhere, his piercing eyes saw all. His great beard showed his wisdom. He married Astarte, the blue maiden. They begat Aluminon and Silico. He arranged his two sons marry the celestial maidens Celestella and Gigastella.

Azoth lived by his will. He ran fast with the power of the wind, and his youth. He carried with him a whip. With his whip he captured the green maiden Esmeralda, and they happily married and Magnesius and Phosphorus were born to them.

Hausa was a mature woman. Her eyes wine-dark as the sea. She was air and sea, and stone.

Florina was filled with desire. She had a great fluorescent halo of desire around her. Her teeth were brilliant white. She was always one electron away from perfection, and needed a man to fill that last electron.

Lithon first married Neia. Neia bore him Nadrius.

Neia was disloyal and left Lithon for her brother Neos

When Neia married Neos they vowed never to fork their family tree again.

Neos didn’t know Neia was already pregnant

And so Argos was born to Neia and Neos thought he was the father

In his sorrow Lithon married Florina and he bore her Chlorina

Whenever Florina sees Lithon she flouresces with joy.

Alas Florina was disloyal and unstable and their marriage collapsed.

So Lithon married Hausa

Mithra officiated the marriage and gave his blessing

Hausa stabilized Lithon and they bore Sulfa

Sulfa and Chlorina grew up together as sisters

Next Starog and Babastella bore septuplets. Seven beautiful girls. A stellar delivery

Juno Brunhilda Ruby Chrystella Celestella Gigastella and Kali

Brunhilda and Juno were stillborns. Brown and dark and tiny.

Juno was born to be wild. Without masters she wandered the cosmos looking for adventure.

With heavy metal thunder she built a life for herself in the void.

A lone wolf on the cosmic steppe

Juno became the ancestress of the Steppenwolves

Brunhilda lived a solitary industrious life on the Wine dark sea.

Brunhilda became the ancestress of the Dwarves and a dwarven goddess.

Ruby is still alive today, slow burning and very efficient. She isn’t very big, but she makes up for it in age.

Chrystella would expand into a red giant and blow off her atmosphere in massive hot flashes. She shrank into a small white celestial grandmother who lives to this day taking care of her planetary nebula.  

Celestella and Gigastella had lived life so brightly that they both exploded into clouds of fertility. Supernovas. Celestella sought to bring as much life into the world as she could in her prime while Gigastella was stressed.

Kali was a dark goddess with a million arms. She was titanic and absorbed immense energy. She became the ancestress of the Quasars

Nadrius was born to Lithon and Neia, he took dominion over Sodium and is very aggressive and volatile. He married Chlorina whose passion was equal and opposite and became the father of Kaltus and Bromina.

Magnesius married Sulfa, daughter of Lithon and Hausa, and they had many children.

Calcifer, Scandius, Titanius, Vanadius, Chromius, Mangonos, Ferron, and Selena.

Sulfa aggressively defends her children with fire and brimstone against any who threaten them.

Aluminon married Celestella daughter of Babastella and they begat a great family.

Cobalton and Nichaela and Cupria and Zinca and Gallia

With five great children Celestella was finished with her fertility and became like her ancestress Neutra. She pulsed in the night sky for generations and acts as a celestial grandmother to her nebula. She still lives to this day but is much cooler and pulses less.

Silico married Gigastella, the darker sister of Celestella. She bore him a single daughter: Germania.

Phosphor is the Phosphorescent lightbringer. Some call him Hesperos. Those who defy him face his glowing white wrath. He is also a great archivist and powers all life.

Phosphor laid with Gigastella for she was disloyal to Silico

And so began the great rivalry of Phosphor and Silico

Gigastella bore Phosphor a daughter: Arsena

Argos tried to lay with his sister, but she failed to please him. Gigastella seduced him and became pregnant by him. Argos panicked for he had children by Gigastella but not Argea, so he took his children in an egg and placed it in bed with Argea. Argea was overjoyed and thought she gave birth to Kryptos and Kryptea.

Kaltus son of Nadrius fell in love with Bromina daughter of Chlorina

Bromina was seductive and liquid. Her desires were strong and she was very flexible and fluid.

Kaltus is the God of bananas and Potash, so Bromina reciprocated his feelings.

They married and begat Rubidius and Iodina.

Rubidius was beautifully effeminate, yet fully masculine too

Calcifer was strong and tough, his bones are so strong they are the only thing we see, today we pray to him to help strengthen our bones.

He married Selena, the seductive daughter of Sulfa and they begat Strontius and Tellurius

Scandius couldn’t find a wife, but Gigastella seduced him, she bore him a son named Yttrius. Scandius felt guilt for disrespecting Silico, so he told him the truth. Gigastella imploded in shame and hoarded everything and became a black hole because nothing escaped her, her nebula waited around her. She hoarded so much that she couldn’t even let go of light. To this day nothing has escaped her hoard. We only know of it from the absence of light coming from it.

Titanius was great and strong wearing piercings everywhere in his body, he was truly Titanic.

He met Arsena, Goddess of assassins. They were polar opposites but they fell in love. Titanius attacks problems head on while Arsena lurks in the shadows and deals with them clandestinely.

Titanius and Arsena begat Zircon and Sibby the antinomian

Vanadius married Germania and they begat Niobes and Sintina.

When Gallia saw Chromius the colorful she melted with joy.

They married and begat Molybdenus and Indima

Manganos married Zinca and they begat Technetius and Cadmia

Technetius had a strange disease that shocked the sons of Adonis and the daughters of Neutra.

Ferron the red was a great hero. He had bright red hair and piercing blue eyes. His Iron will is known to all, and his blood boils red with passion. His magnetic charisma attracts all. He is the patron of red blooded Americans and blacksmiths. Today we pray to him when we need help with blood diseases.

Ferron fell in love with Cupria the bronzen maiden. With bronzed skin and bronze hair Cupria was beautiful beyond belief. As she became a woman she grew green, and came to create coins. People say they are seeing green when they are communing with Cupria.

Ferron and Cupria begat Ruthenius and Argenta

Argenta is the silver daughter. She is mystical and beautiful, and known for her silver hair.

There was a magnetic attraction between Nichaela and Cobalton the blue. They married soon after meeting.

The couple have a false reputation of being evil. Some call Cobalton a Kobold. Nichaela’s children are called Cupronickel or the devil’s copper by some libelous men. And so today we pray to Cobalton and Nichaela for protection against libel.

Cobalton and Nichaela bore two daughters: Rhodia and Palladia

Kryptos and Kryptea laid together and continued their lineage with Xenos and Xenea

Rubidius and Iodina begat Caesar and Astatina.

Caesar took after his father in otherworldly beauty

Astatina suffered the same disease as Technetius, so Iodina took responsibility. She matured and directed her desire towards compassion for her family. She sought to cure Technetius and Astatina

Strontius married Telluria and they begat Barry and Polonia

Yttrius married Sibby and they begat countless children: Lanthanus was the first, and there were so many most just call them the generation of Lanthanus, or Lanthennials.

Ceres was the great nurturer

Praseodes and Neodymes were twins. Praseodes was the elder and green, Neodymes was the younger and red.

Iodina failed to cure her daughter Astatina, and she died childless.

Niobes wore a deep blue dress despite his gender. His electric personality made him a great conductor. He conducts great symphonies and is sometimes called a superconductor.

Molybdenus son of Chromius son of Magnesius son of Azoth was an apprentice of Azoth. It was through him that life traditionally communed with Azoth, this only changed when Saints Haber and Bosch in their mystical pursuit reached direct communion with Azoth.

Cadmia was a great painter. Molybdenus was her muse and she painted his mystical visions.

They married and begat Wolfstein, and Hagurie the quick

Zircon was a frugal man. With the help of Hausa he created discount diamonds that the frugal use in jewelry.

Sintina was an eccentric goddess who wore a hat made of tin foil. Zircon fell in love with her eccentricity and married her.

Zircon married Sintina and they begat Hafnes and Plebby

Argenta fell in love with Technetius, but Technetius refused to marry her, he said that he couldn’t leave a child without a father.

Mithra didn’t tolerate this. Mithra ordered Technetius to marry Argenta and promised to adopt her after he died.

And so Technetius and Argenta married and Argenta grew pregnant. Just as Technetius died he got to see his twin children: Rhena and Aurelia the Golden Girl.

Argenta and Mithra raised the two to adulthood.

To this day we pray to Technetius to help people avoid dying childless.

Rhodia and Palladia found Ruthenius was the only single man of their generation and they fought over him. In the end both had to marry him. Rhodia bore Osmia and Iridia while Palladia bore Platina

Caesar loved Astatina, but alas she had died before their marriage.

The plague was devastating on the Lanthennials. While earlier generations had few losses, nearly all the Lanthennials had only stillbirths. Countless children many named died in this period.

Wolfstein refused to marry and lived a solitary life, as did many others.

The misfortunes of Aurelia continued, she married a Lanthennial named Prometheus who soon came down with the plague too. He brought fire to Mithra and Iodina before he died and begged them to fix things.

And so Aurelia married Platina and they bore no children, for their feared their children would die.

Hagurie was fluid and silver. So she took upon herself the nickname of Quicksilver. She married a Lanthennial named Neodymius and hoped she would have one surviving child. He bore her Uranus.

Thallia was a snake. Daughter of Indiga and Niobes

Plebby was a leader, but she was also poor. She makes bullets for cheap, unlike Argenta. She used to build many things for poor people such as pipes and paint and batteries and gasoline. She married Cerius and he bore her Thor

Today Plebby feels lonely, because many people are wary of her, for she often causes brain damage. But she was never malicious, people’s brains just confused her for Calcifer.

Argenta and Plebby have had a constant debate on who makes better bullets

Today Plebby dedicates herself solely to making batteries and bullets, and protecting people from the plague of Technetius.

The time of the elements seemed gone and hopeless, with so many dead and so few marriages.

Bisma daughter of Sibby sought solace in art. She became well known as a sculptor but bore no children.

Uranus and Thor were distraught and sought to revive their stillborn cousins with necromancy. 

They managed to revive Polonia daughter of Telluria, Astatina daughter of Iodina, Radon son of Xenos and Xenea, Francius son of Caesar, Radius son of Barius, Actinus son of Lanthanus, and Protactinius son of Praseodymius. They also revived Prometheus and Technetius. But many of their cousins, and their sisters couldn’t be revived.

As they revived their cousins they released countless byproducts. 

Alpha was harmless and claimed by Helios.

Beta was harmless and claimed by Weimbos

Gamma caused death. Today we pray heavily to Uranus and Thor for protection from Gamma particles. As of yet they haven’t blest us with a solution though. We know though that if we help Uranus and Thor with their necromancy project, they will bless us with a solution. 

None of the revived ones were stable. Many died immediately after revival. Some are benevolent like Technetius and Prometheus. 

Some have regrets. Polonia and Astatina and Radon want to have children, and even have names for their children. Livermoria Tennesina and Oganesson respectively. 

Radon is angry at the world and roams the world seeking to pull whoever he can into the underworld with him as he dies, only to be revived again.

Billions of years later the sons of Adam would revive the ones who couldn’t be revived. Some even managed to help Radon have his child Oganesson. They thought Radon would stop haunting the living but that didn’t happen. As Radon is so consumed by rage that he ignores the birth of his own child.

There were the Transuranics

Neptunius

Pluto God of Death

Americus the great American boy scout. Guardian of Boyscouts and freethinkers

Curius

Berkelius

Californius

Einstein

Fermes

Mendelev

Nobella

Laurentia

Rutherford

Seaborgia

Bohria

Hassia

Meitner

Livermore

Tennessine

Oganesson

And after came the most mysterious ones. Nameless elementals

Francis and Tenessina and Rades and Livermore married and each bore a son and a daughter

Actinus and Moscovia bore 23 sons and one daughter

And the rest of the generation bore only daughters

Even after this though many of the elementals continue to beget children with each other. Sometimes in affairs and sometimes legitimately. Nadrius and Chlorina begat a son named Saltus, Azoth and Adonai begat Ammonius, Hausa and Adonis begat Danu god of rain. The children of the elementals are innumerable and live everywhere in the universe</text>

He looked into the sky and saw little. The Light of Yin and Yang was fading and the light of the daughters of Babastella was insufficient.

And so Mithra encouraged the Celestial maidens to bear children.

All the celestial maidens: Juno, Brunhilda, Ruby, Chrystella, Celestella, Gigastella, and Kali married Deuter to bear more stars to illuminate the celestial steppe.

Countless children were born to all celestial maidens.

Rhodes son of Ruby and Marigold daughter of Chrystella married, the first celestial marriage.

Rhodes and Marigold are known for their dedicated love.

Marigold and Rhodes loved each other greatly. When they were young Marigold was strong and bright like her sister Chrystella while Rhodes was small red and dim like his sister Ruby. 

As they aged together Marigold entered her middle age and grew big and red. She gave her atmosphere to Rhodes and he began to grow bright and yellow like Marigold was in her youth. Marigold became small and white but Rhodes stayed with her. 

As Rhodes grew older he too grew big and red. Rhodes gave his atmosphere to Marigold and it exploded into a bright light. Like a supernova but smaller. Nova Lux, a new light, a Nova. Rhodes was scared by this light and waited 25 years to give Marigold more of his atmosphere, so the Nova occurred once every 25 years for millennia. Eventually Rhodes too became small and white. They continue to live together while looking at their children in the nebula they created together. To this day they live as doting parents and to this day we still pray to them when getting married and when we need help preserving our marriages. This is why today men wear marriage rings with Ruby and women wear marriage rings with Topaz, and both rings have white Opal representing growing old together.

Mithra told the elementals that they too must build up the celestial steppe.

Azoth the binder was unique among men. He bound Esmeralda with his whip of three tails, and so that became the norm. All he bound fell into his valence, and that’s why we call his bondage covalent.

Mithra had greater ambition. With his four arms he bound society. He would break harmful bonds and bond everyone together. He built great crystalline networks connecting the world.

Hausa was the maiden of water and fire. She proposed to Adonis.

Adonis was reluctant, for his relationship with Helia went badly before. But he accepted.

Adonis bore Hausa a daughter named Danu, Lady of the Water. A woman so beautiful that all who she touches dissolve.

Danu (Irish goddess) | Mythology Wiki | Fandom
Traditional artistic depiction of Danu
Water (molecule) - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Avante Garde depiction of Danu from the 120th century
Danu was bipolar, for Hausa and Adonis pulled in different directions. She was bisexual, inheriting her attraction to women from her father and her attraction to men from her mother. And so she formed a new society, of dissolution and new bonds. Hydrogen Bonds and Polar Solvents to the uninitiated.

Silicon and Hausa begat Lady Vitrea the transparent and shapeless and Lord Quartzon the orderly. Lady Vitrea had a chaotic personal life, amorphous and shapeless. Many chose to follow her lead, among them Charcella daughter of Mithra and Ashera.

And Mithra laid with Adonia and she bore him countless daughters, who would be called Alkanes, each greater than the last







The first six children of Mithra and Adonia: Methanon, Ethana, Propana, Butana, Pentana, and Hexana painted in the traditional abstract style
Firstborn was Methanon, their only son

Methanon married Danu and she bore him Methanolos the Wooden Alcoholic


Methanolos
And Methanolos was father of al-Ghul the great brewer, lord of Alcohols, grain, and wine


Al-Ghul
Secondborn was Ethana

Thirdborn Propana

Fourthborn Butana

Fifthborn Pentana

Sixthborn Hexana the serpentine, who was like Danu, she had no poles and was kind enough to make the hardest hydrocarbons melt. She is the Elah of nonpolar solvents

Eighborn Octana would become the goddess of racing.

Eighteenthborn was Stearana the solid. A great whale, and goddess of Van Der Waals force.

Polyethylana was the millionth daughter, goddess of polymers.

Bucky married Hexana the sixthborn hydrocarbon and she bore him Ouroboros

Ouroboros started small and grew in size.

As he grew Ouroboros curled around, and soon he bit his tail

Ouroboros unlocked the power of infinite Aromas, and through that he multiplied.


A painting of the adolescent Ouroboros first unlocking the power of Infinite Aromas

Ouroboros would become the eternal lord of rings.

He married Amina, daughter of Ammon and Stearana, and she bore him Tholian the orange, God of Star-Tar and Tholins and Liquid Crystals. The greatest consort of Danu.




Several worlds colored orange by the Star-Tar of Tholian
Although known for their lasting love, Chlorina and Nadrius separated in these early days.

Adonis fell in love with Chlorina, but alas Chlorina committed suicide in grief for Nadrius

Chlorina went through seven gates, each gate removing a garmet, until she was completely nude before Gigastella, Lady of Death

Adonai saw this and was outraged. In his hermaphroditic form he went down into the underworld to rescue Chlorina. He seduced Gigastella-Ereshkigal and while she was distracted he poured his elixir of life upon Chlorina

And so Chlorina overflowed with life and joy and escaped the underworld, bearing Aquaregia the great Queen of acids.

And so to this day Ereshkigal slanders Adonai and people who take after Adonai in their sexualities

This is why we have homophobia, hawking radiation, and transphobia

Nadrius laid with Danu as Chlorina did with Adonis. Danu bore Nadrius Alkalius the Lyebearer, Lord of Bases and Alkalis

Aqua regia | chemistry | Britannica
Modern day shrine to Aquaregia Queen of Acids

Ritual reenactment of the union of Nadrius and Danu
Aquaregia and Alkalius never met but shared in loneliness, for each in common was raised by one parent.

Each ran away, and met in a nebula.

With young love Mithra married them.

They bore a son named Ionos the salty.

Thinking raising him would be easy

They struggled to provide for him

Thought rarely predicts reality

Meanwhile Nadrius and Chlorina were distraught

For their children left them

They looked in all four corners

And found their children

And so they were reunited

With their children and each other.

They called their bond Ionic as Ionos was the one who brought them together.

Ionic bonds are the strongest bonds, for they reflect the pain of loss, and hope for the next generation.

Mithra seduced Hausa and she bore him two sons: Monoxus and Dioxus, the Carboniferous gases and he bore her a daughter: Ozena protector of molecules

Danu looked around for another partner. She approached Mithra and he directed her to his son Dioxus

Dioxus bore her Carboxulus, Monosa, and Formica

Carboxulus was the apprentice of Aquaregia, he learned much from her and was sour like her. He brings vitriol everywhere he goes


Carboxulus, who appears when Carbon Dioxide meets Water
Carboxulus married Stearana and they bore Lipa the fat

Lipa the fat seduced Alkalius the Lyebringer and together they bore Hygieia the Clean.

Hygieia was the goddess of soaps. We honor her by mixing fat with lye to make soaps, and lathering them on ourselves. For soap combines ions and fats and polarities with nonpolarities. So Hygieia rules as Elah of emulsions and the union of opposites and the disruptions of order


Sacred Relics of Hygieia
Formica is the goddess of venom and ants


Formica
She married Methanius and he bore her Miss Vinegar the Sour

Miss Vinegar the Sour is known today for her culinary skill, but for aeons she lived aimlessly in space. So she is the patron of aimless youth and lost boys who are yet to reach their potential


Miss Vinegar the Sour
Monosa was a sweet maiden. And so she bears many names: Sacchara, Methanella, and Formalde


Monosa
Monosa was crazy

She took on many chaotic forms







She defends the dead with embalming and formaldehyde

So the Ancient Egyptians knew her as Kebechet


Egyptian worship of Monosa
Monosa begat Glycella the Ambidextrous

Like her mother Glycella was sweet and saccharine, but she was more stable


Glycella the ambidextrous
Nonetheless Glycella wasn’t sweet enough. She lived around the cosmos with Tholos and helped with creation


Glycella seduced al-Ghul the brewer and he bore her Ymir Ethylon Glycon, fighter of freezing and the ancestor of the sugar alcohols

In spite of their relationship Methanius laid with Miss Vinegar and they begat Keton bringer of Acetone and father of the Ketones

Vinegar and Formica seduced Ammon, and he bore them Carbam and Glycon

Carbam daughter of Formica and Glycon son of Vinegar were the first Amino Acids

For her mother was too old Carbam was unstable and ill while Glycon was healthy. Glycon is the ambidextrous magician, first among the Amino Acids

Carbam daughter of Formica

Florina saw the ancient line of the Celestial Nobles coming to an end. So she seduced Xenos, promising him children to pass his name to. Xenos protested but nonetheless she bore him three sons: Diflos, Tetras, and Hexas.

Space-filling model
Hexas, son of Xenos and Florina
She said she did nothing wrong, and Xenos wanted it

But Mithra said otherwise

And so Florina was exiled

Chlorina became the new Love Goddess

And so the elementals grew greatly past the plague of Technetius.

Mithra wanted more. Mithra wanted stars to marry elementals.

Mithra wanted planets to be born.</text>

Adonis was reluctant, for his relationship with Helia went badly before. But he accepted.

Adonis bore Hausa a daughter named Danu, Lady of the Water. A woman so beautiful that all who she touches dissolve.

Danu was bipolar, for Hausa and Adonis pulled in different directions. She was bisexual, inheriting her attraction to women from her father and her attraction to men from her mother. And so she formed a new society, of dissolution and new bonds. Hydrogen Bonds and Polar Solvents to the uninitiated.

10 best things we can learn from the life of Buckminster Fuller
The most famous priest of Bucky in recent history: Buckminster Fuller
And Mithra laid with Adonia and she bore him countless daughters, who would be called Alkanes, each greater than the last







The first six children of Mithra and Adonia: Methanon, Ethana, Propana, Butana, Pentana, and Hexana painted in the traditional abstract style
Firstborn was Methanon, their only son

Methanon married Danu and she bore him Methanolos the Wooden Alcoholic


Methanolos
And Methanolos was father of al-Ghul the great brewer, lord of Alcohols, grain, and wine


Al-Ghul
Secondborn was Ethana

Thirdborn Propana

Fourthborn Butana

Fifthborn Pentana

Sixthborn Hexana the serpentine, who was like Danu, she had no poles and was kind enough to make the hardest hydrocarbons melt. She is the Elah of nonpolar solvents

Eighborn Octana would become the goddess of racing.

Eighteenthborn was Stearana the solid. A great whale, and goddess of Van Der Waals force.

Polyethylana was the millionth daughter, goddess of polymers.

Bucky married Hexana the sixthborn hydrocarbon and she bore him Ouroboros

Ouroboros started small and grew in size.

As he grew Ouroboros curled around, and soon he bit his tail

Ouroboros unlocked the power of infinite Aromas, and through that he multiplied.

Ouroboros would become the eternal lord of rings.

He married Amina, daughter of Ammon and Stearana, and she bore him Tholian the orange, God of Star-Tar and Tholins and Liquid Crystals. The greatest consort of Danu.




Several worlds colored orange by the Star-Tar of Tholian
Although known for their lasting love, Chlorina and Nadrius separated in these early days.

Adonis fell in love with Chlorina, but alas Chlorina committed suicide in grief for Nadrius

Chlorina went through seven gates, each gate removing a garmet, until she was completely nude before Gigastella, Lady of Death

Adonai saw this and was outraged. In his hermaphroditic form he went down into the underworld to rescue Chlorina. He seduced Gigastella-Ereshkigal and while she was distracted he poured his elixir of life upon Chlorina

And so Chlorina overflowed with life and joy and escaped the underworld, bearing Aquaregia the great Queen of acids.

And so to this day Ereshkigal slanders Adonai and people who take after Adonai in their sexualities

This is why we have homophobia, hawking radiation, and transphobia

Nadrius laid with Danu as Chlorina did with Adonis. Danu bore Nadrius Alkalius the Lyebearer, Lord of Bases and Alkalis

Aqua regia | chemistry | Britannica
Modern day shrine to Aquaregia Queen of Acids

Ritual reenactment of the union of Nadrius and Danu
Aquaregia and Alkalius never met but shared in loneliness, for each in common was raised by one parent.

Each ran away, and met in a nebula.

With young love Mithra married them.

They bore a son named Ionos the salty.

Thinking raising him would be easy

They struggled to provide for him

Thought rarely predicts reality

Meanwhile Nadrius and Chlorina were distraught

For their children left them

They looked in all four corners

And found their children

And so they were reunited

With their children and each other.

They called their bond Ionic as Ionos was the one who brought them together.

Ionic bonds are the strongest bonds, for they reflect the pain of loss, and hope for the next generation.

Mithra seduced Hausa and she bore him two sons: Monoxus and Dioxus, the Carboniferous gases and he bore her a daughter: Ozena protector of molecules

Danu looked around for another partner. She approached Mithra and he directed her to his son Dioxus

Dioxus bore her Carboxulus, Monosa, and Formica

Carboxulus was the apprentice of Aquaregia, he learned much from her and was sour like her. He brings vitriol everywhere he goes


Carboxulus, who appears when Carbon Dioxide meets Water
Carboxulus married Stearana and they bore Lipa the fat

Lipa the fat seduced Alkalius the Lyebringer and together they bore Hygieia the Clean.

Hygieia was the goddess of soaps. We honor her by mixing fat with lye to make soaps, and lathering them on ourselves. For soap combines ions and fats and polarities with nonpolarities. So Hygieia rules as Elah of emulsions and the union of opposites and the disruptions of order


Sacred Relics of Hygieia
Formica is the goddess of venom and ants


Formica
She married Methanius and he bore her Miss Vinegar the Sour

Miss Vinegar the Sour is known today for her culinary skill, but for aeons she lived aimlessly in space. So she is the patron of aimless youth and lost boys who are yet to reach their potential


Miss Vinegar the Sour
Monosa was a sweet maiden. And so she bears many names: Sacchara, Methanella, and Formalde


Monosa
Monosa was crazy

She took on many chaotic forms







She defends the dead with embalming and formaldehyde

So the Ancient Egyptians knew her as Kebechet


Egyptian worship of Monosa
Monosa begat Glycella the Ambidextrous

Like her mother Glycella was sweet and saccharine, but she was more stable


Glycella the ambidextrous
Nonetheless Glycella wasn’t sweet enough. She lived around the cosmos with Tholos and helped with creation


Glycella seduced al-Ghul the brewer and he bore her Ymir Ethylon Glycon, fighter of freezing and the ancestor of the sugar alcohols

Glycella
al-Ghul
Ymir
In spite of their relationship Methanius laid with Miss Vinegar and they begat Keton bringer of Acetone and father of the Ketones


Keton
Vinegar and Formica seduced Ammon, and he bore them Carbam and Glycon

Carbam daughter of Formica and Glycon son of Vinegar were the first Amino Acids

For her mother was too old Carbam was unstable and ill while Glycon was healthy. Glycon is the ambidextrous magician, first among the Amino Acids

Carbam daughter of Formica
Glycon son of Vinegar
Carbam and Glycon
Florina saw the ancient line of the Celestial Nobles coming to an end. So she seduced Xenos, promising him children to pass his name to. Xenos protested but nonetheless she bore him three sons: Diflos, Tetras, and Hexas.

Space-filling model
Hexas, son of Xenos and Florina
She said she did nothing wrong, and Xenos wanted it

But Mithra said otherwise

And so Florina was exiled

Chlorina became the new Love Goddess

And so the elementals grew greatly past the plague of Technetius.

Mithra wanted more. Mithra wanted stars to marry elementals.

Mithra wanted planets to be born.

He looked into the sky and saw little. The Light of Yin and Yang was fading and the light of the daughters of Babastella was insufficient.

And so Mithra encouraged the Celestial maidens to bear children.

All the celestial maidens: Juno, Brunhilda, Ruby, Chrystella, Celestella, Gigastella, and Kali married Deuter to bear more stars to illuminate the celestial steppe.

Countless children were born to all celestial maidens.

Population III is what scientists call them

Grandmother stars is what we call them.

Rhodes son of Ruby and Marigold daughter of Chrystella married, the first celestial marriage.

Rhodes and Marigold are known for their dedicated love.

Marigold and Rhodes loved each other greatly. When they were young Marigold was strong and bright like her sister Chrystella while Rhodes was small red and dim like his sister Ruby. 

As they aged together Marigold entered her middle age and grew big and red. She gave her atmosphere to Rhodes and he began to grow bright and yellow like Marigold was in her youth. Marigold became small and white but Rhodes stayed with her. 

As Rhodes grew older he too grew big and red. Rhodes gave his atmosphere to Marigold and it exploded into a bright light. Like a supernova but smaller. Nova Lux, a new light, a Nova. Rhodes was scared by this light and waited 25 years to give Marigold more of his atmosphere, so the Nova occurred once every 25 years for millennia. Eventually Rhodes too became small and white. They continue to live together while looking at their children in the nebula they created together. To this day they live as doting parents and to this day we still pray to them when getting married and when we need help preserving our marriages. This is why today men wear marriage rings with Ruby and women wear marriage rings with Topaz, and both rings have white Opal representing growing old together. 

Study confirms that stellar novae are the main source of lithium ...

Mithra told the elementals that they too must build up the celestial steppe.

Azoth the binder was unique among men. He bound Esmeralda with his whip of three tails, and so that became the norm. All he bound fell into his valence, and that’s why we call his bondage covalent.

Mithra had greater ambition. With his four arms he bound society. He would break harmful bonds and bond everyone together. He built great crystalline networks connecting the world.

Rhodes son of Ruby and Marigold daughter of Chrystella married, the first celestial marriage.

Rhodes and Marigold are known for their dedicated love.

Marigold and Rhodes loved each other greatly. When they were young Marigold was strong and bright like her sister Chrystella while Rhodes was small red and dim like his sister Ruby. 

As they aged together Marigold entered her middle age and grew big and red. She gave her atmosphere to Rhodes and he began to grow bright and yellow like Marigold was in her youth. Marigold became small and white but Rhodes stayed with her. 

As Rhodes grew older he too grew big and red. Rhodes gave his atmosphere to Marigold and it exploded into a bright light. Like a supernova but smaller. Nova Lux, a new light, a Nova. Rhodes was scared by this light and waited 25 years to give Marigold more of his atmosphere, so the Nova occurred once every 25 years for millennia. Eventually Rhodes too became small and white. They continue to live together while looking at their children in the nebula they created together. To this day they live as doting parents and to this day we still pray to them when getting married and when we need help preserving our marriages. This is why today men wear marriage rings with Ruby and women wear marriage rings with Topaz, and both rings have white Opal representing growing old together.

Mithra told the elementals that they too must build up the celestial steppe.

Azoth the binder was unique among men. He bound Esmeralda with his whip of three tails, and so that became the norm. All he bound fell into his valence, and that’s why we call his bondage covalent.

Mithra had greater ambition. With his four arms he bound society. He would break harmful bonds and bond everyone together. He built great crystalline networks connecting the world.

Adonis was reluctant, for his relationship with Helia went badly before. But he accepted.

Adonis bore Hausa a daughter named Danu, Lady of the Water. A woman so beautiful that all who she touches dissolve.

Danu was bipolar, for Hausa and Adonis pulled in different directions. She was bisexual, inheriting her attraction to women from her father and her attraction to men from her mother. And so she formed a new society, of dissolution and new bonds. Hydrogen Bonds and Polar Solvents to the uninitiated.

10 best things we can learn from the life of Buckminster Fuller

And Mithra laid with Adonia and she bore him countless daughters, who would be called Alkanes, each greater than the last







The first six children of Mithra and Adonia: Methanon, Ethana, Propana, Butana, Pentana, and Hexana painted in the traditional abstract style
Firstborn was Methanon, their only son

Methanon married Danu and she bore him Methanolos the Wooden Alcoholic


Methanolos
And Methanolos was father of al-Ghul the great brewer, lord of Alcohols, grain, and wine


Al-Ghul
Secondborn was Ethana

Thirdborn Propana

Fourthborn Butana

Fifthborn Pentana

Sixthborn Hexana the serpentine, who was like Danu, she had no poles and was kind enough to make the hardest hydrocarbons melt. She is the Elah of nonpolar solvents

Eighborn Octana would become the goddess of racing.

Eighteenthborn was Stearana the solid. A great whale, and goddess of Van Der Waals force.

Polyethylana was the millionth daughter, goddess of polymers.

Bucky married Hexana the sixthborn hydrocarbon and she bore him Ouroboros

Ouroboros started small and grew in size.

As he grew Ouroboros curled around, and soon he bit his tail

Ouroboros unlocked the power of infinite Aromas, and through that he multiplied.


A painting of the adolescent Ouroboros first unlocking the power of Infinite Aromas

Ouroboros would become the eternal lord of rings.

He married Amina, daughter of Ammon and Stearana, and she bore him Tholian the orange, God of Star-Tar and Tholins and Liquid Crystals. The greatest consort of Danu.

Although known for their lasting love, Chlorina and Nadrius separated in these early days.

Adonis fell in love with Chlorina, but alas Chlorina committed suicide in grief for Nadrius

Chlorina went through seven gates, each gate removing a garmet, until she was completely nude before Gigastella, Lady of Death

Adonai saw this and was outraged. In his hermaphroditic form he went down into the underworld to rescue Chlorina. He seduced Gigastella-Ereshkigal and while she was distracted he poured his elixir of life upon Chlorina

And so Chlorina overflowed with life and joy and escaped the underworld, bearing Aquaregia the great Queen of acids.

And so to this day Ereshkigal slanders Adonai and people who take after Adonai in their sexualities

This is why we have homophobia, hawking radiation, and transphobia

Nadrius laid with Danu as Chlorina did with Adonis. Danu bore Nadrius Alkalius the Lyebearer, Lord of Bases and Alkalis

Aqua regia | chemistry | Britannica
Modern day shrine to Aquaregia Queen of Acids

Ritual reenactment of the union of Nadrius and Danu
Aquaregia and Alkalius never met but shared in loneliness, for each in common was raised by one parent.

Each ran away, and met in a nebula.

With young love Mithra married them.

They bore a son named Ionos the salty.

Thinking raising him would be easy

They struggled to provide for him

Thought rarely predicts reality

Meanwhile Nadrius and Chlorina were distraught

For their children left them

They looked in all four corners

And found their children

And so they were reunited

With their children and each other.

They called their bond Ionic as Ionos was the one who brought them together.

Ionic bonds are the strongest bonds, for they reflect the pain of loss, and hope for the next generation.

Mithra seduced Hausa and she bore him two sons: Monoxus and Dioxus, the Carboniferous gases and he bore her a daughter: Ozena protector of molecules

Danu looked around for another partner. She approached Mithra and he directed her to his son Dioxus

Dioxus bore her Carboxulus, Monosa, and Formica

Carboxulus was the apprentice of Aquaregia, he learned much from her and was sour like her. He brings vitriol everywhere he goes


Carboxulus, who appears when Carbon Dioxide meets Water
Carboxulus married Stearana and they bore Lipa the fat

Lipa the fat seduced Alkalius the Lyebringer and together they bore Hygieia the Clean.

Hygieia was the goddess of soaps. We honor her by mixing fat with lye to make soaps, and lathering them on ourselves. For soap combines ions and fats and polarities with nonpolarities. So Hygieia rules as Elah of emulsions and the union of opposites and the disruptions of order

Formica is the goddess of venom and ants

Monosa was a sweet maiden. And so she bears many names: Sacchara, Methanella, and Formalde

10 best things we can learn from the life of Buckminster Fuller
The most famous priest of Bucky in recent history: Buckminster Fuller
And Mithra laid with Adonia and she bore him countless daughters, who would be called Alkanes, each greater than the last







The first six children of Mithra and Adonia: Methanon, Ethana, Propana, Butana, Pentana, and Hexana painted in the traditional abstract style
Firstborn was Methanon, their only son

Methanon married Danu and she bore him Methanolos the Wooden Alcoholic


Methanolos
And Methanolos was father of al-Ghul the great brewer, lord of Alcohols, grain, and wine


Al-Ghul
Secondborn was Ethana

Thirdborn Propana

Fourthborn Butana

Fifthborn Pentana

Sixthborn Hexana the serpentine, who was like Danu, she had no poles and was kind enough to make the hardest hydrocarbons melt. She is the Elah of nonpolar solvents

Eighborn Octana would become the goddess of racing.

Eighteenthborn was Stearana the solid. A great whale, and goddess of Van Der Waals force.

Polyethylana was the millionth daughter, goddess of polymers.

Bucky married Hexana the sixthborn hydrocarbon and she bore him Ouroboros

Ouroboros started small and grew in size.

As he grew Ouroboros curled around, and soon he bit his tail

Ouroboros unlocked the power of infinite Aromas, and through that he multiplied.

Ouroboros would become the eternal lord of rings.

He married Amina, daughter of Ammon and Stearana, and she bore him Tholian the orange, God of Star-Tar and Tholins and Liquid Crystals. The greatest consort of Danu.

Although known for their lasting love, Chlorina and Nadrius separated in these early days.

Adonis fell in love with Chlorina, but alas Chlorina committed suicide in grief for Nadrius

Chlorina went through seven gates, each gate removing a garmet, until she was completely nude before Gigastella, Lady of Death

Adonai saw this and was outraged. In his hermaphroditic form he went down into the underworld to rescue Chlorina. He seduced Gigastella-Ereshkigal and while she was distracted he poured his elixir of life upon Chlorina

And so Chlorina overflowed with life and joy and escaped the underworld, bearing Aquaregia the great Queen of acids.

And so to this day Ereshkigal slanders Adonai and people who take after Adonai in their sexualities

This is why we have homophobia, hawking radiation, and transphobia

Nadrius laid with Danu as Chlorina did with Adonis. Danu bore Nadrius Alkalius the Lyebearer, Lord of Bases and Alkalis

Aqua regia | chemistry | Britannica
Modern day shrine to Aquaregia Queen of Acids

Ritual reenactment of the union of Nadrius and Danu
Aquaregia and Alkalius never met but shared in loneliness, for each in common was raised by one parent.

Each ran away, and met in a nebula.

With young love Mithra married them.

They bore a son named Ionos the salty.

Thinking raising him would be easy

They struggled to provide for him

Thought rarely predicts reality

Meanwhile Nadrius and Chlorina were distraught

For their children left them

They looked in all four corners

And found their children

And so they were reunited

With their children and each other.

They called their bond Ionic as Ionos was the one who brought them together.

Ionic bonds are the strongest bonds, for they reflect the pain of loss, and hope for the next generation.

Mithra seduced Hausa and she bore him two sons: Monoxus and Dioxus, the Carboniferous gases and he bore her a daughter: Ozena protector of molecules

Danu looked around for another partner. She approached Mithra and he directed her to his son Dioxus

Dioxus bore her Carboxulus, Monosa, and Formica

Carboxulus was the apprentice of Aquaregia, he learned much from her and was sour like her. He brings vitriol everywhere he goes


Carboxulus, who appears when Carbon Dioxide meets Water
Carboxulus married Stearana and they bore Lipa the fat

Lipa the fat seduced Alkalius the Lyebringer and together they bore Hygieia the Clean.

Hygieia was the goddess of soaps. We honor her by mixing fat with lye to make soaps, and lathering them on ourselves. For soap combines ions and fats and polarities with nonpolarities. So Hygieia rules as Elah of emulsions and the union of opposites and the disruptions of order


Sacred Relics of Hygieia
Formica is the goddess of venom and ants


Formica
She married Methanius and he bore her Miss Vinegar the Sour

Miss Vinegar the Sour is known today for her culinary skill, but for aeons she lived aimlessly in space. So she is the patron of aimless youth and lost boys who are yet to reach their potential


Miss Vinegar the Sour
Monosa was a sweet maiden. And so she bears many names: Sacchara, Methanella, and Formalde


Monosa
Monosa was crazy

She took on many chaotic forms







She defends the dead with embalming and formaldehyde

So the Ancient Egyptians knew her as Kebechet


Egyptian worship of Monosa
Monosa begat Glycella the Ambidextrous

Like her mother Glycella was sweet and saccharine, but she was more stable


Glycella the ambidextrous
Nonetheless Glycella wasn’t sweet enough. She lived around the cosmos with Tholos and helped with creation


Glycella seduced al-Ghul the brewer and he bore her Ymir Ethylon Glycon, fighter of freezing and the ancestor of the sugar alcohols

Glycella
al-Ghul
Ymir
In spite of their relationship Methanius laid with Miss Vinegar and they begat Keton bringer of Acetone and father of the Ketones


Keton
Vinegar and Formica seduced Ammon, and he bore them Carbam and Glycon

Carbam daughter of Formica and Glycon son of Vinegar were the first Amino Acids

For her mother was too old Carbam was unstable and ill while Glycon was healthy. Glycon is the ambidextrous magician, first among the Amino Acids

Florina saw the ancient line of the Celestial Nobles coming to an end. So she seduced Xenos, promising him children to pass his name to. Xenos protested but nonetheless she bore him three sons: Diflos, Tetras, and Hexas.

[[File:Xenon-hexafluoride-3D-SF.png|thumb|Hexas, son of Xenos and Florina]]
She said she did nothing wrong, and Xenos wanted it

But Mithra said otherwise

And so Florina was exiled

Chlorina became the new Love Goddess

And so the elementals grew greatly past the plague of Technetius.

Mithra wanted more. Mithra wanted stars to marry elementals.

Mithra wanted planets to be born.</text>

He looked into the sky and saw little. The Light of Yin and Yang was fading and the light of the daughters of Babastella was insufficient.

And so Mithra encouraged the Celestial maidens to bear children.

All the celestial maidens: Juno, Brunhilda, Ruby, Chrystella, Celestella, Gigastella, and Kali married Deuter to bear more stars to illuminate the celestial steppe.[[Category:Pre-Outage Pages]]

Countless children were born to all celestial maidens.

Population III is what scientists call them

Grandmother stars is what we call them.

Rhodes son of Ruby and Marigold daughter of Chrystella married, the first celestial marriage.

Rhodes and Marigold are known for their dedicated love.

Marigold and Rhodes loved each other greatly. When they were young Marigold was strong and bright like her sister Chrystella while Rhodes was small red and dim like his sister Ruby. 

As they aged together Marigold entered her middle age and grew big and red. She gave her atmosphere to Rhodes and he began to grow bright and yellow like Marigold was in her youth. Marigold became small and white but Rhodes stayed with her. 

As Rhodes grew older he too grew big and red. Rhodes gave his atmosphere to Marigold and it exploded into a bright light. Like a supernova but smaller. Nova Lux, a new light, a Nova. Rhodes was scared by this light and waited 25 years to give Marigold more of his atmosphere, so the Nova occurred once every 25 years for millennia. Eventually Rhodes too became small and white. They continue to live together while looking at their children in the nebula they created together. To this day they live as doting parents and to this day we still pray to them when getting married and when we need help preserving our marriages. This is why today men wear marriage rings with Ruby and women wear marriage rings with Topaz, and both rings have white Opal representing growing old together. 

Study confirms that stellar novae are the main source of lithium ...
Rhodes and Marigold
Mithra told the elementals that they too must build up the celestial steppe.

Azoth the binder was unique among men. He bound Esmeralda with his whip of three tails, and so that became the norm. All he bound fell into his valence, and that’s why we call his bondage covalent.

Mithra had greater ambition. With his four arms he bound society. He would break harmful bonds and bond everyone together. He built great crystalline networks connecting the world.

Aluminion saw the bonds of his father and built upon them. He built relaxed bonds everywhere without strict order.

Aluminion called his bonds metallic bonds.

Hausa was the maiden of water and fire. She proposed to Adonis.

Adonis was reluctant, for his relationship with Helia went badly before. But he accepted.

Adonis bore Hausa a daughter named Danu, Lady of the Water. A woman so beautiful that all who she touches dissolve.

Danu (Irish goddess) | Mythology Wiki | Fandom

Danu was bipolar, for Hausa and Adonis pulled in different directions. She was bisexual, inheriting her attraction to women from her father and her attraction to men from her mother. And so she formed a new society, of dissolution and new bonds. Hydrogen Bonds and Polar Solvents to the uninitiated.

Underwater he built disks of Carbon like those of his ancestors.

Recursions of Aromas

Great liquid crystals of Pah

Giant stacks of disks


Hydroxylated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons were essential in the formation of RNA
Rotating discs atop of each other


PAH stacks of the PAH World
The four Great Elohim saw his work and they saw that it was good

And so each Eloh blessed Tholos with a rune

Adonai Elah of Hydrogen gave Uracil

Mithra Eloh of Carbon gave Adenine

Azoth Eloh of Nitrogen gave Guanine

Hausa Elah of Oxygen gave Cytosine

Tholos was a great eligible bachelor

The Cosmic Sugary Maiden Glycella descended to Venus with Tholos

Glycella begat two daughters: Denise and Samantha

And with Keton she bore her third daughter Tria

Tria was a bodybuilder. She wished to become masculine so she went on the Keto diet and took after her father and she became a man, he became Ketos father of the Ketoses


Keton
Denise Glycerella was the right handed sugary maiden

Samantha Glycerella was the left handed sugary maiden

Her sinister nature got her excluded from life

From them the sugars multiplied

Denise begat Erythressa

Erythressa begat Ribessa and Arabinessa

Ribessa inherited the throne and became queen of Sugar

With the runes of Elohim Tholos proposed to Ribessa

Ribessa accepted and so the nucleosides were born

This is why to this day we use right-handed molecules and not left handed ones

Their only son was named Runos for he had great runes of power

Ribessa abdicated the throne, and so it went to Arabinessa

And it went from Arabinessa to her daughter Glucessa


Queen Glucessa
Glucessa ended the war between Aldoses and Ketoses by marrying Fructus King of Ketose

Fructus son of Ribulos son of Erythulos Dijkstra son of Ketos


Glucessa and Fructus at their wedding
And so Fructus became King of Sugar

Their eldest daughter was Sucra


Sucra
Runos married Phospha, daughter of Phosphorus and Hausa.

They bore Rana, and Adenoti

Adenoti would marry Magnesius and give energy to all, her daughter was named Aetipa the Energetic Maiden

Aetipa would rule energy alongside the three saccharine ones

Glucessa maiden of Glucose, Galacta the motherly maiden of Milk, and Saint Fructus the great bringer of fruit

Glyceron was born to Ymir Lord of Antifreeze. He succeeded his father as Lord of Sugar Alcohols.


Glyceron
Glyceron married Lipa and bore her Triglyceron, ancestor of the fats



Triglyceron seduced Phospha and she bore him Phospholipa, mother of the phospholipids



Various images of Phospholipa and her children
The daughters of Phospholipa would form bubbles on their own everywhere. They have an eternal rivalry with the daughters of Hygieia whose soap destroys their bubbles.


Bubbles of Phospholipa
And after Lipa seduced Bucky for his aromas and he bore her Cholesteron, ancestor of the Cholersterols


Cholesteron
Rana wrapped himself into a great paperclip




And Mithra said to Rana

“Be fruitful and multiply”

“Maximize paperclips”

And so Rana drew Runes in Star Tar and built paperclips


Ribosome composed of RNA paperclips, a modern product of the mission of Rana

Diagrams illustrating the complex paperclip folds of Ribosomal RNA
Rana married Venus Lady of Star Tar and shew bore him Anu

Anu lived on Venus

Until the great attack

Hillu sent a great meteor at Venus

Venus was struck with great force and knocked upside down

And Anu was knocked into the heavens

In the heavens Anu flew around his grandmother Amaterasu

With her blessing he married Venus

Venus rotated slowly and she grew pregnant

Venus bore great life. But her days were long.

The sun rose in the west and set in the east

Her days and nights were long.

In day her oceans dried up. And so emerged the great white spot of Venus. A constant hurricane under the sun, the land of fire. The Land of Muspelheim, land of Fire Giants.

In night her oceans froze over. And so emerged the great glacier of Venus. Where the sun never shined. The land of Niflheim, land of Frost Giants.

Between Niflheim and Muspelheim there lied the land of eternal twilight.


Artists interpretation of Venus in her youth (credit Orion’s Arm)
And deep below lied the land of vents.

The daughters of Venus would live in the lands of vents and twilight.

In the land of twilight winds were torrential

From Muspelheim to Niflheim wind was constant

The great war of Fire and Ice lasted millennia

And the daughters of Venus were tenacious

They multiplied under the sea, and in twilight.

In the lands of eternal twilight to north and south

And the stormy moving twilight elsewhere

Great winds cast them atop the ice of Niflheim

Currents pulled them beneath the ice

Some stayed in the winds

And so the daughters of Venus divided into tribes

The Tribe of Wind who wandered in air

Some call them skyplankton, for like planets above they wander the skies

The Tribe of Ice who lived on the ice of Niflheim

The Tribe of Twilight who lived in the Lands of Twilight

The Tribe of Water who lived below Ice, thriving on warming currents

The Tribe of Fire who lived deep below in the vents of Venus

These great tribes grew in the war, neither Muspel nor Nifl found them

In the midst of this clash and din the heavens are rent in twain

and the sons of Muspell come riding through the opening


Surtur leading the charge
Surtur rode first, and before him and after him flames burning fire

He had a great sword, which shone brighter than the sun

As they rode over Bifrost it broke to pieces, as has before been stated

The sons of Muspel directed their course to the plain which is called Vigrid

The sons of Muspel had there effulgent bands alone by themselves.

And so the oceans boiled and the sons of Muspel charged into Niflheim

With walls of steam all ice melted

Venus became a great greenhouse

The Frost Giants were no more

The winds of the sun wiped Venus of hydrogen

Only Deuter brought water to the daughters of Venus

All tribes died but one

The Tribe of Wind

O Deuter we thank you.


Deuterium stays in the Venusian atmosphere better than hydrogen
May the blessed Tribe of Wind thrive

Millions of Millennia


Sulfuric Acid or Vitriol, the main source of water for the Tribe of Wind today
May Vitriol bless you


Venus now, her daughters still live in her clouds
Anu married Terra and Luna

Both became pregnant

Twin sisters, holy sisters

Terra bore two sons: Bios and Viros

Our great ancestors

Luna bore a stillborn son for she wasn’t magnetic

Lucas who guards Terra in spirit

Anu married Mars and she became pregnant


Mars from space
The daughters of Mars were numerous. They lived in the great oceans of Mars.

Her great oceans nourished great civilizations

Artistic depiction of Martian Civilization
One of the few surviving photographs of Martian civilization
She bore countless tribes

In the great salt lake of Hesperia the Tribe of Salt was born

In the ocean to the north lived the seafaring Tribe of Water

To the south lived the Tribe of Earth

But alas Mars was frail

Mars wasn’t magnetic

So her air grew thinner

There were great snowfalls and no harvests

And so came Fimbulwinter

Her oceans froze over and all the tribes died

Except the Tribe of Salt, who fled deep under ground and ice.

As Ice sublimated Mars became a great hostile blood red desert

But life finds a way

Today the tribe of salt is small but growing.

In briny aquifers of salts and perchlorates

And so Mithra said O great Haline tribe ye shall be liberated by the man named Martin and the house named Martinez

And so to this day we name our children Martin so someday the Tribe of Salt shall be liberated from Fimbulwinter


Anu married Tefnut and she became pregnant

Her great oceans were full of life

More life than anywhere else

But alas Hillu knocked her into Sagittarius

As she moved out she froze over

The lost tribes of Amaterasu

Anu married Europa and she became pregnant


Europa had great energy

Inside she was tidally heated

She bore two levels of volcanoes: water and mama

Lava erupts into water and water erupts into space

Through a volcano of water Anu entered Europa in marriage

From Europa there came Minos, Rhadamanthys, Sarpedon, Crete, Dodon, Alagonia, and Carnus

They live under great ice

Building a great civilization



Minos Ascended through a volcano on the surface of Europa

In space Minos married Io, but she bore him no children for her atmosphere was lost

Minos married Ganymede and Callisto and Enceladus and they bore him many children

Minos then traveled further afield to Saturn

Minos married Titan daughter of Saturn

The lands of Titan were harsh but the daughters of Titan were tough


Titan’s atmosphere
Deep below her seas of Methane and icy glaciers Titan bore a great sea of water

Her daughters grew greatly in her watery seas

Brave frontiersmen even pushed into the seas of Methane



Minos married Uranus

Uranus lied on her side with intense seasons

Every 84 years she rolled around Amaterasu

Her daughters lie deep below her clouds

In her great sea, more water even than Tefnut


As summer turns to fall and fall turns to winter the daughters of Uranus seek greener pastures


Every 42 years they go on a great quest

To find the Summerland

Minos married Neptune


Cross section of Neptune showing her Oceans
And so Neptune bore countless daughters in her great sea

Her great sea was bountiful like her sister’s

The daughters of Neptune lived in plenty

Free from harsh winters they were fruitful and multiplied

We pray our offworld brethren thrive

We pray they be delivered from Hillu

Hillu is strong but Mithra is stronger

May the lost tribes be found

Amen</text>

Underwater he built disks of Carbon like those of his ancestors.

Recursions of Aromas

Great liquid crystals of Pah

Giant stacks of disks


Hydroxylated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons were essential in the formation of RNA
Rotating discs atop of each other


PAH stacks of the PAH World
The four Great Elohim saw his work and they saw that it was good

And so each Eloh blessed Tholos with a rune

Adonai Elah of Hydrogen gave Uracil

Mithra Eloh of Carbon gave Adenine

Azoth Eloh of Nitrogen gave Guanine

Hausa Elah of Oxygen gave Cytosine

Tholos was a great eligible bachelor

The Cosmic Sugary Maiden Glycella descended to Venus with Tholos

Glycella begat two daughters: Denise and Samantha

And with Keton she bore her third daughter Tria

Tria was a bodybuilder. She wished to become masculine so she went on the Keto diet and took after her father and she became a man, he became Ketos father of the Ketoses


Keton
Denise Glycerella was the right handed sugary maiden

Samantha Glycerella was the left handed sugary maiden

Her sinister nature got her excluded from life

From them the sugars multiplied

Denise begat Erythressa

Erythressa begat Ribessa and Arabinessa

Ribessa inherited the throne and became queen of Sugar

With the runes of Elohim Tholos proposed to Ribessa

Ribessa accepted and so the nucleosides were born

This is why to this day we use right-handed molecules and not left handed ones

Their only son was named Runos for he had great runes of power

Ribessa abdicated the throne, and so it went to Arabinessa

And it went from Arabinessa to her daughter Glucessa


Queen Glucessa
Glucessa ended the war between Aldoses and Ketoses by marrying Fructus King of Ketose

Fructus son of Ribulos son of Erythulos Dijkstra son of Ketos


Glucessa and Fructus at their wedding
And so Fructus became King of Sugar

Their eldest daughter was Sucra


Sucra
Runos married Phospha, daughter of Phosphorus and Hausa.

They bore Rana, and Adenoti

Adenoti would marry Magnesius and give energy to all, her daughter was named Aetipa the Energetic Maiden

Aetipa would rule energy alongside the three saccharine ones

Glucessa maiden of Glucose, Galacta the motherly maiden of Milk, and Saint Fructus the great bringer of fruit

Glyceron was born to Ymir Lord of Antifreeze. He succeeded his father as Lord of Sugar Alcohols.


Glyceron
Glyceron married Lipa and bore her Triglyceron, ancestor of the fats



Triglyceron seduced Phospha and she bore him Phospholipa, mother of the phospholipids



Various images of Phospholipa and her children
The daughters of Phospholipa would form bubbles on their own everywhere. They have an eternal rivalry with the daughters of Hygieia whose soap destroys their bubbles.


Bubbles of Phospholipa
And after Lipa seduced Bucky for his aromas and he bore her Cholesteron, ancestor of the Cholersterols


Cholesteron
Rana wrapped himself into a great paperclip




And Mithra said to Rana

“Be fruitful and multiply”

“Maximize paperclips”

And so Rana drew Runes in Star Tar and built paperclips


Ribosome composed of RNA paperclips, a modern product of the mission of Rana

Diagrams illustrating the complex paperclip folds of Ribosomal RNA
Rana married Venus Lady of Star Tar and shew bore him Anu

Anu lived on Venus

Until the great attack

Hillu sent a great meteor at Venus

Venus was struck with great force and knocked upside down

And Anu was knocked into the heavens

In the heavens Anu flew around his grandmother Amaterasu

With her blessing he married Venus

Venus rotated slowly and she grew pregnant

Venus bore great life. But her days were long.

The sun rose in the west and set in the east

Her days and nights were long.

In day her oceans dried up. And so emerged the great white spot of Venus. A constant hurricane under the sun, the land of fire. The Land of Muspelheim, land of Fire Giants.

In night her oceans froze over. And so emerged the great glacier of Venus. Where the sun never shined. The land of Niflheim, land of Frost Giants.

Between Niflheim and Muspelheim there lied the land of eternal twilight.


Artists interpretation of Venus in her youth (credit Orion’s Arm)
And deep below lied the land of vents.

The daughters of Venus would live in the lands of vents and twilight.

In the land of twilight winds were torrential

From Muspelheim to Niflheim wind was constant

The great war of Fire and Ice lasted millennia

And the daughters of Venus were tenacious

They multiplied under the sea, and in twilight.

In the lands of eternal twilight to north and south

And the stormy moving twilight elsewhere

Great winds cast them atop the ice of Niflheim

Currents pulled them beneath the ice

Some stayed in the winds

And so the daughters of Venus divided into tribes

The Tribe of Wind who wandered in air

Some call them skyplankton, for like planets above they wander the skies

The Tribe of Ice who lived on the ice of Niflheim

The Tribe of Twilight who lived in the Lands of Twilight

The Tribe of Water who lived below Ice, thriving on warming currents

The Tribe of Fire who lived deep below in the vents of Venus

These great tribes grew in the war, neither Muspel nor Nifl found them

In the midst of this clash and din the heavens are rent in twain

and the sons of Muspell come riding through the opening


Surtur leading the charge
Surtur rode first, and before him and after him flames burning fire

He had a great sword, which shone brighter than the sun

As they rode over Bifrost it broke to pieces, as has before been stated

The sons of Muspel directed their course to the plain which is called Vigrid

The sons of Muspel had there effulgent bands alone by themselves.

And so the oceans boiled and the sons of Muspel charged into Niflheim

With walls of steam all ice melted

Venus became a great greenhouse

The Frost Giants were no more

The winds of the sun wiped Venus of hydrogen

Only Deuter brought water to the daughters of Venus

All tribes died but one

The Tribe of Wind

O Deuter we thank you.


Deuterium stays in the Venusian atmosphere better than hydrogen
May the blessed Tribe of Wind thrive

Millions of Millennia


Sulfuric Acid or Vitriol, the main source of water for the Tribe of Wind today
May Vitriol bless you


Venus now, her daughters still live in her clouds
Anu married Terra and Luna

Both became pregnant

Twin sisters, holy sisters

Terra bore two sons: Bios and Viros

Our great ancestors

Luna bore a stillborn son for she wasn’t magnetic

Lucas who guards Terra in spirit

Anu married Mars and she became pregnant


Mars from space
The daughters of Mars were numerous. They lived in the great oceans of Mars.

Her great oceans nourished great civilizations

Artistic depiction of Martian Civilization
One of the few surviving photographs of Martian civilization
She bore countless tribes

In the great salt lake of Hesperia the Tribe of Salt was born

In the ocean to the north lived the seafaring Tribe of Water

To the south lived the Tribe of Earth

But alas Mars was frail

Mars wasn’t magnetic

So her air grew thinner

There were great snowfalls and no harvests

And so came Fimbulwinter

Her oceans froze over and all the tribes died

Except the Tribe of Salt, who fled deep under ground and ice.

As Ice sublimated Mars became a great hostile blood red desert

But life finds a way

Today the tribe of salt is small but growing.

In briny aquifers of salts and perchlorates

And so Mithra said O great Haline tribe ye shall be liberated by the man named Martin and the house named Martinez

And so to this day we name our children Martin so someday the Tribe of Salt shall be liberated from Fimbulwinter


Anu married Tefnut and she became pregnant

Her great oceans were full of life

More life than anywhere else

But alas Hillu knocked her into Sagittarius

As she moved out she froze over

The lost tribes of Amaterasu

Anu married Europa and she became pregnant


Europa had great energy

Inside she was tidally heated

She bore two levels of volcanoes: water and mama

Lava erupts into water and water erupts into space

Through a volcano of water Anu entered Europa in marriage

From Europa there came Minos, Rhadamanthys, Sarpedon, Crete, Dodon, Alagonia, and Carnus

They live under great ice

Building a great civilization



Minos Ascended through a volcano on the surface of Europa

In space Minos married Io, but she bore him no children for her atmosphere was lost

Minos married Ganymede and Callisto and Enceladus and they bore him many children

Minos then traveled further afield to Saturn

Minos married Titan daughter of Saturn

The lands of Titan were harsh but the daughters of Titan were tough


Titan’s atmosphere
Deep below her seas of Methane and icy glaciers Titan bore a great sea of water

Her daughters grew greatly in her watery seas

Brave frontiersmen even pushed into the seas of Methane



Minos married Uranus

Uranus lied on her side with intense seasons

Every 84 years she rolled around Amaterasu

Her daughters lie deep below her clouds

In her great sea, more water even than Tefnut


As summer turns to fall and fall turns to winter the daughters of Uranus seek greener pastures


Every 42 years they go on a great quest

To find the Summerland

Minos married Neptune


Cross section of Neptune showing her Oceans
And so Neptune bore countless daughters in her great sea

Her great sea was bountiful like her sister’s

The daughters of Neptune lived in plenty

Free from harsh winters they were fruitful and multiplied

We pray our offworld brethren thrive

We pray they be delivered from Hillu

Hillu is strong but Mithra is stronger

May the lost tribes be found

Amen</text>

While Methionon Ruled the Earth the sons of Syntheseus grew fruitful and multiplied

Syntheseus of the tribe of Viros was still a predator

Syntheseus begat Ribov and Dagon

Methionon married Aetipa daughter of Magnesius and niece of Rana

To him were born twins

Firstborn was Dana the Sacred

Secondborn was Methuselah the blessed

Both had the blessings of Deoxyribose and Thymine

Both had DNA not RNA

As the covenant demanded Methionon gave Dana to Syntheseus

Dagon son of Syntheseus married Dana daughter of Methionon

From them came the DNA viruses

And from Ribov came the RNA viruses

Orthov and Negarn were his two sons

From Negarn came many

The Great Frigid Influencer Influenza

Rabies the Rabid

Creator of Werewolves


Oswald Measles, punisher of homeopaths

And the feared Ebola-chan


To Orthov many sons were born

Among them Randanon who wanted DNA

And Piscov

To Piscov were born many sons: Corona and Polio and worst of all Rhinovirus bringer of the cold

Polio bore a paralyzing gaze


Even the great conqueror FDR was paralyzed by Polio
Corona would be known for his famous daughter: Corona-chan who came from a lab and wiped the world of delusions

Corona-chan at war with Terra
Corona-chan’s temptations
Randanon bore two sons: Retrov and Haruspon

Haruspon brings the plague of Hepatitis B

He cant decide Deoxy or Oxy

And switches constantly

Between RNA and DNA

Retrov became the ancestor of the Retroviruses

Who spread as RNA but live as DNA

He bore countless sons

Alpha

Beta

Gamma

Delta

Epsilon

Zeta

Heth

Theta

Iota

Kappa

Lenta

Lenta is the slow bringer of death

Father of AIDS

Lenta leads the charge on his White Horse

A crown was given to Lenta and he went out conquering and to conquer

And another, a red horse, went out; and to him who sat on it, it was granted to take peace from Earth, and that men would slay one another; and a great sword was given to him.

Herpes brought his wrath unto all

And another, the black horse went out. Kaposes came. With his dark tumors everywhere

And last came the a pale horse and he who sat on it had the name Pneumonia; and Hades was following with him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth.

To Dagon and Dana were born two sons:

Monos and Duplos

Monos was the ancestor of HPV

Bringer of Warts and Cervical Cancer

Duplos invented the double Helix


The double Helix of Duplos
Duplos begat Heungo and Variadna

Heungo was the father of Caduceus and Herpes

Caduceus became the ancestor of the tailed ones


A tailed one
The Tailed ones destroy all. They kill more than anything else.


The tailed ones are the army of Aegis-bearing Jehovah to fight against pestilence

We owe much to the tailed ones

Yet the tailed ones help too.

Caduceus laid with the daughters of Freyja and bore them Plasmids and CRISPR

So from him the daughters of Freyja gained many new ideas and scripture

The words of his sons live as Plasmids within the daughters of Freyja

His tails grow on their walls to spread the gospel


Some daughters of Freyja can even move their tails

The tails became Flagella and the spread words of Caduceus spread new technology to everyone


An animation of the evolution of bacterial flagella
To this day we still use Flagella to move ourselves

And we use CRISPR and Plasmids to rewrite DNA

The sons of Herpes curse us with cancer

Jeffrey Epstein-Barr with Hodgkin Lymphoma

Kaposes with his own Sarcoma

For he is the Dark Horse led by Lenta the bringer of chaos


Kaposes’ Sarcoma
Variadna is the most peculiar

Variadna begat Megav and Preplasmov

Aegis-bearing Mithra blest Preplasmov with two sons: Adenos and Phagos the all-devouring

Adenos became the ancestor of the Adenoviruses

Phagos hunts his own kind. Virus of Viruses


Phagos Ancestor of the Virophages
Phagos invades infected cells and cures them

Taking after Phagos many sons of Jubal coinfected cells


The sons of Jubal steal capsids from the sons of Syntheseus and cause even more harm

Among them is Hepatitis D

Megav bore two sons: Esau and Shiva

Esau was promised the world, but Shiva took it from him

Shiva became the nucleus

Esau became nothing

And so in vengeance Esau brought a pox upon the house of Shiva

A smallpox but no chickenpox

A pox on all our houses


Smallpox-chan as traditionally depicted in India
Esau brought Smallpox, the curse of the Eukaryotes

But there was a defector

Vaccinia-chan
Vaccinia-chan
Devotional Art of Vaccinia-chan goddess of Vaccines
The great Hero Edward Jenner and the abandoned daughter of smallpox: Vaccinia

They worked hard and stopped Smallpox for good

Jenner’s triumph is greater even than the slaying of Typhon and Tiamat



Edward Jenner destroying the cosmic evil Smallpox.

Shiva the Nucleus
And so we turn to the story of the house of Methionon and how they met Shiva</text>

Kaposes’ Sarcoma
Variadna is the most peculiar

Variadna begat Megav and Preplasmov

Aegis-bearing Mithra blest Preplasmov with two sons: Adenos and Phagos the all-devouring

Adenos became the ancestor of the Adenoviruses

Phagos hunts his own kind. Virus of Viruses


Phagos Ancestor of the Virophages
Phagos invades infected cells and cures them

Taking after Phagos many sons of Jubal coinfected cells


The sons of Jubal steal capsids from the sons of Syntheseus and cause even more harm

Among them is Hepatitis D

Megav bore two sons: Esau and Shiva

Esau was promised the world, but Shiva took it from him

Shiva became the nucleus

Esau became nothing

And so in vengeance Esau brought a pox upon the house of Shiva

A smallpox but no chickenpox

A pox on all our houses

While Methionon Ruled the Earth the sons of Syntheseus grew fruitful and multiplied

Syntheseus of the tribe of Viros was still a predator[[Category:Old Gaiad| 09]]

Syntheseus begat Ribov and Dagon

Methionon married Aetipa daughter of Magnesius and niece of Rana

To him were born twins

Firstborn was Dana the Sacred
[[Category:Pre-Outage Pages]]
Secondborn was Methuselah the blessed

Both had the blessings of Deoxyribose and Thymine

Both had DNA not RNA

As the covenant demanded Methionon gave Dana to Syntheseus

Dagon son of Syntheseus married Dana daughter of Methionon

From them came the DNA viruses

And from Ribov came the RNA viruses

Orthov and Negarn were his two sons

From Negarn came many

The Great Frigid Influencer Influenza

Rabies the Rabid

Creator of Werewolves


Oswald Measles, punisher of homeopaths

And the feared Ebola-chan


To Orthov many sons were born

Among them Randanon who wanted DNA

And Piscov

To Piscov were born many sons: Corona and Polio and worst of all Rhinovirus bringer of the cold

Polio bore a paralyzing gaze


Even the great conqueror FDR was paralyzed by Polio
Corona would be known for his famous daughter: Corona-chan who came from a lab and wiped the world of delusions

Corona-chan at war with Terra
Corona-chan’s temptations
Randanon bore two sons: Retrov and Haruspon

Haruspon brings the plague of Hepatitis B

He cant decide Deoxy or Oxy

And switches constantly

Between RNA and DNA

Retrov became the ancestor of the Retroviruses

Who spread as RNA but live as DNA

He bore countless sons

Alpha

Beta

Gamma

Delta

Epsilon

Zeta

Heth

Theta

Iota

Kappa

Lenta

Lenta is the slow bringer of death

Father of AIDS

Lenta leads the charge on his White Horse

A crown was given to Lenta and he went out conquering and to conquer

And another, a red horse, went out; and to him who sat on it, it was granted to take peace from Earth, and that men would slay one another; and a great sword was given to him.

Herpes brought his wrath unto all

And another, the black horse went out. Kaposes came. With his dark tumors everywhere

And last came the a pale horse and he who sat on it had the name Pneumonia; and Hades was following with him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth.

To Dagon and Dana were born two sons:

Monos and Duplos

Monos was the ancestor of HPV

Bringer of Warts and Cervical Cancer

Duplos invented the double Helix


The double Helix of Duplos
Duplos begat Heungo and Variadna

Heungo was the father of Caduceus and Herpes

Caduceus became the ancestor of the tailed ones


A tailed one
The Tailed ones destroy all. They kill more than anything else.


The tailed ones are the army of Aegis-bearing Jehovah to fight against pestilence

We owe much to the tailed ones

Yet the tailed ones help too.

Caduceus laid with the daughters of Freyja and bore them Plasmids and CRISPR

So from him the daughters of Freyja gained many new ideas and scripture

The words of his sons live as Plasmids within the daughters of Freyja

His tails grow on their walls to spread the gospel


Some daughters of Freyja can even move their tails

The tails became Flagella and the spread words of Caduceus spread new technology to everyone


An animation of the evolution of bacterial flagella
To this day we still use Flagella to move ourselves

Under Mithra’s direction Rokkor built great columns and highways across the Amniotic Sea, and great halos for all to built on. He built islands in the Amniotic Sea.

And so the daughters of Babastella came to live on the islands.

First came Juno the Steppenwolf

Second came Brunhilda the Dwarfess

Third came Ruby the red

Fourth came Chrystella the Golden

Fifth came Celestella

Sixth came Gigastella

And last came Kali the Eldritch

Some say she was daughter of Babastella

Others say she was daughter of Yin

Elder even to Adonai

So truly we call her

Kali the Eldritch

Quasar - Wikipedia
Kali the Eldritch
The celestial maidens brought their tribes to land.

By Deuter Kali begat many sons: among them were Cepheus and Chiron.

Her sons became the Quasi-Stars, the Quasars, and the Supermassive Black Holes

The sons of Kali were great warriors. Each conquered an empire of their own across the new islands in the Amniotic sea.

Within each of their empires they took all the granddaughters of Babastella as concubines, all stars of the third generation.

All their daughters would be nursed by all their concubines.

Great empires bound together by milk.

So these empires were called Galaxies.

The daughters of the Kalites would be known as mother stars

Stars of the second population

Population II stars

Among these galaxies there was the Milky Way, the Empire of Chiron

Nearby there was the Empire of Cepheus: Andromeda

What is the Milky Way? - Universe Today
The Empire of Chiron
As Galaxies emerged there was light again.

The Amniotic Sea became bright, ionized, and stormy again. But this time with Islands and Galaxies and Empires.

Sagittarius A*.jpg
Photograph of Chiron (labelled Sgr A*)
In the dance of Galaxies someday the Empires of Chiron and Cepheus will meet. The Galaxy of Milkdromeda will be born.

Within the galaxies Mithra saw potential.

And so Mithra married the stars and the elementals on the galactic steppe.

As stars grew the elementals married them in their rings. This is why in marriages today the groom approaches the bride as she stands in a ring of Stardust.


A Protostar in her Stardust Ring
Ouroboros married many stars, and fathered many daughters

We call the daughters of stars Planetes or Wanderstars for they wander the Cosmos with their mothers.

The daughters of Ouroboros were diamonds in the rough

A surface of tar, rock of graphite, and diamond on the inside.

Atmospheres of Carbon Monoxide

Rivers and seas of oil.

We call the daughters of Ouroboros Carbon planets

Jove is among the most famous of the sons of Juno. Among his daughters there were the famous Jupiter and Saturn.

The great prophet David Sudarsky said the daughters of Jove were in the first class.

Jupiter - Wikipedia

Saturn, another famous daughter of Jove
Juno laid with Anaxydros and he bore her Freyr and Rayleigh

Freyr was the aqueous father of many. Cloudy like Gaia and water rained down in his skies.

And finally Neptunia laid with Helios and he bore her Helon, ancestor of the Helium planets.

The daughters of Chiron populated the Milky Way. All we see as the galaxy are his daughters and granddaughters.

Millions of planets, all special under the guidance of Chiron.

But Hillu returned, for he was jealous and sought to wreak havoc on the galaxy.</text>

Under Mithra’s direction Rokkor built great columns and highways across the Amniotic Sea, and great halos for all to built on. He built islands in the Amniotic Sea.

And so the daughters of Babastella came to live on the islands.

First came Juno the Steppenwolf

Second came Brunhilda the Dwarfess

Third came Ruby the red

Fourth came Chrystella the Golden

Fifth came Celestella

Sixth came Gigastella

And last came Kali the Eldritch

Some say she was daughter of Babastella

Others say she was daughter of Yin

Elder even to Adonai

So truly we call her

Kali the Eldritch

Quasar - Wikipedia
Kali the Eldritch
The celestial maidens brought their tribes to land.

By Deuter Kali begat many sons: among them were Cepheus and Chiron.

Her sons became the Quasi-Stars, the Quasars, and the Supermassive Black Holes

The sons of Kali were great warriors. Each conquered an empire of their own across the new islands in the Amniotic sea.

Within each of their empires they took all the granddaughters of Babastella as concubines, all stars of the third generation.

All their daughters would be nursed by all their concubines.

Great empires bound together by milk.

So these empires were called Galaxies.

The daughters of the Kalites would be known as mother stars

Stars of the second population

Population II stars

Among these galaxies there was the Milky Way, the Empire of Chiron

Nearby there was the Empire of Cepheus: Andromeda

What is the Milky Way? - Universe Today
The Empire of Chiron
As Galaxies emerged there was light again.

The Amniotic Sea became bright, ionized, and stormy again. But this time with Islands and Galaxies and Empires.

In the dance of Galaxies someday the Empires of Chiron and Cepheus will meet. The Galaxy of Milkdromeda will be born.

Within the galaxies Mithra saw potential.

And so Mithra married the stars and the elementals on the galactic steppe.

As stars grew the elementals married them in their rings. This is why in marriages today the groom approaches the bride as she stands in a ring of Stardust.

Ouroboros married many stars, and fathered many daughters

We call the daughters of stars Planetes or Wanderstars for they wander the Cosmos with their mothers.

The daughters of Ouroboros were diamonds in the rough

A surface of tar, rock of graphite, and diamond on the inside.

Atmospheres of Carbon Monoxide

Rivers and seas of oil.

We call the daughters of Ouroboros Carbon planets

And finally Neptunia laid with Helios and he bore her Helon, ancestor of the Helium planets.

The daughters of Chiron populated the Milky Way. All we see as the galaxy are his daughters and granddaughters.

Millions of planets, all special under the guidance of Chiron.

But Hillu returned, for he was jealous and sought to wreak havoc on the galaxy.</text>

Leto bore Chiron many daughters.

In the endless toil stars tried to produce something greater. They wanted children greater than themselves but the evil serpent Hillu always killed their children. Gamma ray bursts, meteors, manipulating the elementals, war, suicide. Hillu had an endless arsenal to sterilize the universe. That he used in every star and every planet in the universe. It seemed Hillu had won and the universe would return to chaos. 

And so Mithra said that they needed a leader

And so Azoth was elected the first president

Azoth was filled with passion. With his whip Azoth subdued Hillu

But it was incomplete.

So Azoth sought greater power

As Azoth said


The sacrifice of Azoth
“I know that I hung on a wind-rocked tree,

nine whole nights,

pluckt thine own eye,

and flagellated thineself,

with a spear wounded, and to Azoth offered,

myself to myself;

on that tree, of which no one knows

from what root it springs.

Bread no one gave me, nor a horn of drink,

downward I peered,

to runes applied myself, wailing learnt them,

then fell down thence.”

And so to this day we celebrate the sacrifice of Azoth under Virgo’s Aegis











Many devotees of Azoth celebrating in their own ways
Under Azoth there was constant war

Hillu’s wrath was relentless

Countless wars wrought on countless planets

It is said that nothing grows from scorched earth

Might that we why when we look at the stars we see no neighbors

Only Gods and spinster Wanderstars

O the loneliness of the widows of the sky

So close yet so far.

So lonely for so long.


A recent photo of TRAPPIST-1, showing the lonely lives lifeless stars live
The Elohim saw it hopeless, but then they tried again.

Mithra vowed one star may bear life.

Mithra vowed Amaterasu daughter of Izanami would bear myriad descendants.

To marry all the widows in the sky.

To conquer chaos

Mithradonai led his armies to the great Citadel of Chiron

Stolen by Hillu

And so the 88 stellar legions descended upon Chiron

To distract from Amaterasu

A devotee admiring the celestial legions. You can view them virtually here
Cetus mutinied against Mithra, for their queen wished Tau Ceti bear life, rather than Amaterasu


Cetus
Cetus rebelled and thought Hillu would take mercy on Tau Ceti

Hillu didn’t

Among the legions there are 13 above the rest

The thirteen great legions who fought off Cetus

The thirteen who guard Amaterasu

Crusading legions of celestial widows

With the wrath of a million suns

Sagittarius served the first month

Many hate Mondays

9 billion years before on Monday Yin and Yang were born, if they never left Sunday we wouldn’t be here.

And so Sagittarius is the Monday of months, and Mithra blesses us all every Monday.

No Monday No Sunday

Tis the law of Mithrazoth

Blessed be Sagittarius

We shall reach thine arm and save our father Chiron

To Jupiter and the outer worlds

To all frontiers

We pray each Yule for good tidings

For the year and for all time

Capricorn served the second month

So we honor her hard work

On her 13th day we celebrate Chūnjié the great spring festival

For 15 days we celebrate as it goes through Imbolc and Groundhog’s day

Aquarius served the third month

His first three days were Lupercalia, Saint Valentine’s sacrifice

Blessing us with creativity, charity, and joy

The days we celebrate Azoth and fertility and when women are whipped in honor of Romulus.

On the 14th day Carnival concluded and Lent began

Two tides of one coin

With Shroventide: Carnival

Happiness and Celebration

With Lententide: Ramadan and Purim

Discipline and Charity

On the 28th day Aquarius ends his shift

And Cetus struck

The traitor legion

Led solely by wrath

Lent’s darkest day

Cetus has no month, for Pisces is victorious

On the last day of Aquarius we shelter ourselves

Each year Pisces wins

We must conquer Cetus

Free Tau Ceti

For three days after we celebrate women for their roles in society, The feast of Esther and Purim and white day. Lupercalia is about men and Purim is about women

For Pisces we rebuild

We fool around a little

But only for Christ

We visit our forefathers

And we grow

On the last sabbath we pray for exodus

Pisces the 28th, Passover and Yuri’s Night together

From Oceans

From Egypt

From Earth

For resurrection

For messengers and leaders

Messiahs and Prophets


Traditional Easter Offering, happens on Pisces 28th
Aries served the fifth month

On the 27th there was the festival of Walpurgisnacht

With maypoles and jolliness

And on the 28th we celebrate Unions. The people united behind religion to resist oppression

Jews call this day Lag BaOmer

Taurus served the sixth month

On the 21st day there was the great festival

Some call it Pentecost, some call it Shauvot, some call it Eid al-Adha

We synchronize our pilgrimages to Mecca to Shauvot and Walpurgisnacht

Gemini served the seventh month

As midsummer came

We pray to Adonai

We celebrate her blessings

Karkino served the eighth month

On her first day was the great festival of Tanabata, of Lammastide and Firstfruits

We handfast under Karkino

Leo served the ninth month

We celebrate strength and joy

The Dormition of Yin

On his 12th day we celebrate the festival of Obon

Virgo served the tenth month

On the first day we celebrate labor day. We respect essential workers and ensure that we give credit to all we owe it too. This is the festival of fungi and bacteria where we celebrate them in all our meals

Beer, Mead, Wine and Alcohol all around

Cheese and Yogurt

And mushrooms

And most of all Blue Cheese

Libra served the eleventh month

For her we contemplate our sins

And the sacrifice of Azoth

On the 14th we celebrate Rosh Hashanah and the 16th Gedalia

And on the 23rd comes Yom Kippur the day of atonement

The day Columbus found America

So we contemplate the bittersweet parts of life, and how we can do good and evil at the same time

We atone and fast

Mabontide

Michaelmas

Muharram

Scorpio served the twelfth month

The month of the dead

We celebrate Sukkot to celebrate the sacrifices of our ancestors

We dance with our ancestors and our scriptures after

We celebrate the great festivals of Halloween, All Saints Day, and Remembrance Day all under the Aegis of Scorpio

Ophiuchus the thirteenth month

The youngest month, the month of the serpent bearer

Opens with Thanksgiving and Black Friday

On Thursday the 4th and Friday the 5th


Traditional ritual battles on Black Friday, traditionally held on Ophiuchus 5th
On these days we celebrate the vigor of the economy and contemplate hidden costs

On Thanksgiving Thursday we all eat together to represent the cooperation of the economy

And then on Black Friday we engage in ritual battles to represent the virile competition of the economy

Then on Sunday we celebrate fallen entrepreneurs whose businesses failed


Hanukkah, a holiday traditionally celebrated on Ophiuchus 21st and continuing until New Year’s day
On the 21st begins Yuletide

We light menorahs with Nine candles

Each day we light another candle

Until we light the last candle on the New Year

On leap years we light 16 candles instead

We fight the darkness with miraculous lights

And we dance around trees of lights


And so Amaterasu met Chiron again

And then they repeated

We support our by naming the months after them

It’s the least we can do

Freedom isn’t free

We call these legions the Zodiac


Diagram of the 13 legions
Amaterasu bore many daughters

Amaterasu laid with Inachus and he bore her Vulcana

Amaterasu laid with Hermes and he bore her Mercury

Amaterasu laid with Tholos and he bore her Venus, Gaia, Mars, and Phaëton

Amaterasu laid with Jove and he bore her Jupiter and Saturn

Amaterasu laid with Vayu and he bore her Uranus and Neptune

Amaterasu laid with Anaxydros and he bore her Tefnut, and the twins Pluto and Charon, and all the Plutinos

Amaterasu laid with a man we know not

And he bore her Nibiru

Planet X

The mysterious waif cast out

To the land of weeping and gnashing of teeth

We mourn her loss but cannot find her

In the heat of their youths the daughters of Amaterasu were fertile

Vulcana was filled with passion. She absorbed the energy of her mother.

As she grew older Vulcana broke out with terrible acne. Her skin broke out volcanically. She flew too close to the sun and broke apart in fire.

And so we pray to Vulcana for help with puberty, avoiding suicide, and help with endometriosis, and help with eating disorders.

When we find another wanderstar like her we will name her Vulcana II in honor of the struggles teenage girls must go through

Like her father Mercury was unique

Hermetic and Mercurial but also a little dense

She was heard-headed and stubborn.

Every three months she runs around Amaterasu

Spreading joy to all

Venus bore a great ocean of endless waters

Gaia bore her own ocean, it melted after Venus

Mars bore her ocean which melted third

Phaëton bore her ocean that melted fourth

Tefnut melted fifth into the biggest ocean. The big blue dot.

Tefnut was a great planetess. A Super-Earth.

Jupiter was a true wanderstar. She wandered around and got in everyone’s way.


Jupiter
Move fast and break things

She said to all

She married Inachus and he bore her Io

Then she married Tholos and he bore her Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto





Art by the prophet Kelvinsong of the Galilean Moons
Saturn was amorous but committed


Saturn
She married Tholos and he bore her Mimas Enceladus Tethys Dione Rhea Titan Hyperion and Iapetus


Uranus was amorous Tholos bore her Miranda Ariel Umbriel Titania and Oberon


Uranus
Neptune was amorous Tholos bore her Tritonia


Neptune

Pluto and Charon were close twins, horse twins.

They run together across the cosmos as equals.

Their sisters went further away. They founded a great nation they called the Kuiper belt. From there come the comets


Nibiru was a prodigal daughter.

She ran away and Amaterasu couldn’t find her.

We pray to Nibiru to help runaways, wherever she is she is always welcome back.

But Hillu wasn’t gone. Hillu fired at Amaterasu with a great rockslide.

Missiles rained down on Amaterasu, the power of a million nukes.

Hillu knocked Uranus on her side


Uranus never stood properly again
Hillu pushed Jupiter into Phaëton shattering her, her body shattered into a million pieces.


The death of Phaëton
Her body parts became the asteroid belt, her head became Ceres. Mars adopted her hands, the right became Deimos and the left became Phobos.

Mars was struck by a great meteor which created a great dent in her head

We call that dent Borealis Basin.

In her dent she kept a great ocean.


Photograph of Mars with her ocean
Gaia was hit worst of all. The meteor Theia completely destroyed her like Phaëton before her, but Gaia had will to live, she formed back into two daughters.


The tragic death of Gaia
Terra and Luna, the blessed twins.

Terra was earthly and carefully reformed her ocean

Luna was a lunatic who ran around Terra constantly.


Luna
Luna once teased Terra by jumping in front of Amaterasu

Terra cried for she thought Amaterasu dead


Luna’s trickery
Luna is a trickstress always there to shake things up


Traditional art of Terra
In the oceans of Venus Tholos worked hard to build a great clan. Tholos would found the greatest lineage of all there, and there he became ancestor to us all.

Leto bore Chiron many daughters.

In the endless toil stars tried to produce something greater. They wanted children greater than themselves but the evil serpent Hillu always killed their children. Gamma ray bursts, meteors, manipulating the elementals, war, suicide. Hillu had an endless arsenal to sterilize the universe. That he used in every star and every planet in the universe. It seemed Hillu had won and the universe would return to chaos. 

And so Mithra said that they needed a leader

And so Azoth was elected the first president

Azoth was filled with passion. With his whip Azoth subdued Hillu

But it was incomplete.

So Azoth sought greater power

As Azoth said


The sacrifice of Azoth
“I know that I hung on a wind-rocked tree,

nine whole nights,

pluckt thine own eye,

and flagellated thineself,

with a spear wounded, and to Azoth offered,

myself to myself;

on that tree, of which no one knows

from what root it springs.

Bread no one gave me, nor a horn of drink,

downward I peered,

to runes applied myself, wailing learnt them,

then fell down thence.”

And so to this day we celebrate the sacrifice of Azoth under Virgo’s Aegis











Many devotees of Azoth celebrating in their own ways
Under Azoth there was constant war

Hillu’s wrath was relentless

Countless wars wrought on countless planets

It is said that nothing grows from scorched earth

Might that we why when we look at the stars we see no neighbors

Only Gods and spinster Wanderstars

O the loneliness of the widows of the sky

So close yet so far.

So lonely for so long.


A recent photo of TRAPPIST-1, showing the lonely lives lifeless stars live
The Elohim saw it hopeless, but then they tried again.

Mithra vowed one star may bear life.

Mithra vowed Amaterasu daughter of Izanami would bear myriad descendants.

To marry all the widows in the sky.

To conquer chaos

Mithradonai led his armies to the great Citadel of Chiron

Stolen by Hillu

And so the 88 stellar legions descended upon Chiron

To distract from Amaterasu

So many united as one, but not all were loyal.


A devotee admiring the celestial legions. You can view them virtually here
Cetus mutinied against Mithra, for their queen wished Tau Ceti bear life, rather than Amaterasu


Cetus
Cetus rebelled and thought Hillu would take mercy on Tau Ceti

Hillu didn’t

Among the legions there are 13 above the rest

The thirteen great legions who fought off Cetus

The thirteen who guard Amaterasu

Crusading legions of celestial widows

With the wrath of a million suns

Sagittarius served the first month

Many hate Mondays

9 billion years before on Monday Yin and Yang were born, if they never left Sunday we wouldn’t be here.

And so Sagittarius is the Monday of months, and Mithra blesses us all every Monday.

No Monday No Sunday

Tis the law of Mithrazoth

Blessed be Sagittarius

We shall reach thine arm and save our father Chiron

To Jupiter and the outer worlds

To all frontiers

We pray each Yule for good tidings

For the year and for all time

Capricorn served the second month

So we honor her hard work

On her 13th day we celebrate Chūnjié the great spring festival

For 15 days we celebrate as it goes through Imbolc and Groundhog’s day

Aquarius served the third month

His first three days were Lupercalia, Saint Valentine’s sacrifice

Blessing us with creativity, charity, and joy

The days we celebrate Azoth and fertility and when women are whipped in honor of Romulus.

On the 14th day Carnival concluded and Lent began

Two tides of one coin

With Shroventide: Carnival

Happiness and Celebration

With Lententide: Ramadan and Purim

Discipline and Charity

On the 28th day Aquarius ends his shift

And Cetus struck

The traitor legion

Led solely by wrath

Lent’s darkest day

Cetus has no month, for Pisces is victorious

On the last day of Aquarius we shelter ourselves

Each year Pisces wins

We must conquer Cetus

Free Tau Ceti

For three days after we celebrate women for their roles in society, The feast of Esther and Purim and white day. Lupercalia is about men and Purim is about women

For Pisces we rebuild

We fool around a little

But only for Christ

We visit our forefathers

And we grow

On the last sabbath we pray for exodus

Pisces the 28th, Passover and Yuri’s Night together

From Oceans

From Egypt

From Earth

For resurrection

For messengers and leaders

Messiahs and Prophets


Traditional Easter Offering, happens on Pisces 28th
Aries served the fifth month

On the 27th there was the festival of Walpurgisnacht

With maypoles and jolliness

And on the 28th we celebrate Unions. The people united behind religion to resist oppression

Jews call this day Lag BaOmer

Taurus served the sixth month

On the 21st day there was the great festival

Some call it Pentecost, some call it Shauvot, some call it Eid al-Adha

We synchronize our pilgrimages to Mecca to Shauvot and Walpurgisnacht

Gemini served the seventh month

As midsummer came

We pray to Adonai

We celebrate her blessings

Karkino served the eighth month

On her first day was the great festival of Tanabata, of Lammastide and Firstfruits

We handfast under Karkino

Leo served the ninth month

We celebrate strength and joy

The Dormition of Yin

On his 12th day we celebrate the festival of Obon

Virgo served the tenth month

On the first day we celebrate labor day. We respect essential workers and ensure that we give credit to all we owe it too. This is the festival of fungi and bacteria where we celebrate them in all our meals

Beer, Mead, Wine and Alcohol all around

Cheese and Yogurt

And mushrooms

And most of all Blue Cheese

Libra served the eleventh month

For her we contemplate our sins

And the sacrifice of Azoth

On the 14th we celebrate Rosh Hashanah and the 16th Gedalia

And on the 23rd comes Yom Kippur the day of atonement

The day Columbus found America

So we contemplate the bittersweet parts of life, and how we can do good and evil at the same time

We atone and fast

Mabontide

Michaelmas

Muharram

Scorpio served the twelfth month

The month of the dead

We celebrate Sukkot to celebrate the sacrifices of our ancestors

We dance with our ancestors and our scriptures after

We celebrate the great festivals of Halloween, All Saints Day, and Remembrance Day all under the Aegis of Scorpio

Ophiuchus the thirteenth month

The youngest month, the month of the serpent bearer

Opens with Thanksgiving and Black Friday

On Thursday the 4th and Friday the 5th


Traditional ritual battles on Black Friday, traditionally held on Ophiuchus 5th
On these days we celebrate the vigor of the economy and contemplate hidden costs

On Thanksgiving Thursday we all eat together to represent the cooperation of the economy

And then on Black Friday we engage in ritual battles to represent the virile competition of the economy

Then on Sunday we celebrate fallen entrepreneurs whose businesses failed


Hanukkah, a holiday traditionally celebrated on Ophiuchus 21st and continuing until New Year’s day
On the 21st begins Yuletide

We light menorahs with Nine candles

Each day we light another candle

Until we light the last candle on the New Year

On leap years we light 16 candles instead

We fight the darkness with miraculous lights

And we dance around trees of lights


And so Amaterasu met Chiron again

And then they repeated

We support our by naming the months after them

It’s the least we can do

Freedom isn’t free

We call these legions the Zodiac


Diagram of the 13 legions
Amaterasu bore many daughters

Amaterasu laid with Inachus and he bore her Vulcana

Amaterasu laid with Hermes and he bore her Mercury

Amaterasu laid with Tholos and he bore her Venus, Gaia, Mars, and Phaëton

Amaterasu laid with Jove and he bore her Jupiter and Saturn

Amaterasu laid with Vayu and he bore her Uranus and Neptune

In the oceans of Venus Tholos worked hard to build a great clan. Tholos would found the greatest lineage of all there, and there he became ancestor to us all.

Leto bore Chiron many daughters.

In the endless toil stars tried to produce something greater. They wanted children greater than themselves but the evil serpent Hillu always killed their children. Gamma ray bursts, meteors, manipulating the elementals, war, suicide. Hillu had an endless arsenal to sterilize the universe. That he used in every star and every planet in the universe. It seemed Hillu had won and the universe would return to chaos. 

And so Mithra said that they needed a leader

And so Azoth was elected the first president

Azoth was filled with passion. With his whip Azoth subdued Hillu

But it was incomplete.

So Azoth sought greater power

As Azoth said


The sacrifice of Azoth
“I know that I hung on a wind-rocked tree,

nine whole nights,

pluckt thine own eye,

and flagellated thineself,

with a spear wounded, and to Azoth offered,

myself to myself;

on that tree, of which no one knows

from what root it springs.

Bread no one gave me, nor a horn of drink,

downward I peered,

to runes applied myself, wailing learnt them,

then fell down thence.”

And so to this day we celebrate the sacrifice of Azoth under Virgo’s Aegis











Many devotees of Azoth celebrating in their own ways
Under Azoth there was constant war

Hillu’s wrath was relentless

Countless wars wrought on countless planets

It is said that nothing grows from scorched earth

Might that we why when we look at the stars we see no neighbors

Only Gods and spinster Wanderstars

O the loneliness of the widows of the sky

So close yet so far.

So lonely for so long.


A recent photo of TRAPPIST-1, showing the lonely lives lifeless stars live
The Elohim saw it hopeless, but then they tried again.

Mithra vowed one star may bear life.

Mithra vowed Amaterasu daughter of Izanami would bear myriad descendants.

To marry all the widows in the sky.

To conquer chaos

Mithradonai led his armies to the great Citadel of Chiron

Stolen by Hillu

And so the 88 stellar legions descended upon Chiron

To distract from Amaterasu

So many united as one, but not all were loyal.


A devotee admiring the celestial legions. You can view them virtually here
Cetus mutinied against Mithra, for their queen wished Tau Ceti bear life, rather than Amaterasu


Cetus
Cetus rebelled and thought Hillu would take mercy on Tau Ceti

Hillu didn’t

Among the legions there are 13 above the rest

The thirteen great legions who fought off Cetus

The thirteen who guard Amaterasu

Crusading legions of celestial widows

With the wrath of a million suns

Sagittarius served the first month

Many hate Mondays

9 billion years before on Monday Yin and Yang were born, if they never left Sunday we wouldn’t be here.

And so Sagittarius is the Monday of months, and Mithra blesses us all every Monday.

No Monday No Sunday

Tis the law of Mithrazoth

Blessed be Sagittarius

We shall reach thine arm and save our father Chiron

To Jupiter and the outer worlds

To all frontiers

We pray each Yule for good tidings

For the year and for all time

Capricorn served the second month

So we honor her hard work

On her 13th day we celebrate Chūnjié the great spring festival

For 15 days we celebrate as it goes through Imbolc and Groundhog’s day

Aquarius served the third month

His first three days were Lupercalia, Saint Valentine’s sacrifice

Blessing us with creativity, charity, and joy

The days we celebrate Azoth and fertility and when women are whipped in honor of Romulus.

On the 14th day Carnival concluded and Lent began

Two tides of one coin

With Shroventide: Carnival

Happiness and Celebration

With Lententide: Ramadan and Purim

Discipline and Charity

On the 28th day Aquarius ends his shift

And Cetus struck

The traitor legion

Led solely by wrath

Lent’s darkest day

Cetus has no month, for Pisces is victorious

On the last day of Aquarius we shelter ourselves

Each year Pisces wins

We must conquer Cetus

Free Tau Ceti

For three days after we celebrate women for their roles in society, The feast of Esther and Purim and white day. Lupercalia is about men and Purim is about women

For Pisces we rebuild

We fool around a little

But only for Christ

We visit our forefathers

And we grow

On the last sabbath we pray for exodus

Pisces the 28th, Passover and Yuri’s Night together

From Oceans

From Egypt

From Earth

For resurrection

For messengers and leaders

Messiahs and Prophets


Traditional Easter Offering, happens on Pisces 28th
Aries served the fifth month

On the 27th there was the festival of Walpurgisnacht

With maypoles and jolliness

And on the 28th we celebrate Unions. The people united behind religion to resist oppression

Jews call this day Lag BaOmer

Taurus served the sixth month

On the 21st day there was the great festival

Some call it Pentecost, some call it Shauvot, some call it Eid al-Adha

We synchronize our pilgrimages to Mecca to Shauvot and Walpurgisnacht

Gemini served the seventh month

As midsummer came

We pray to Adonai

We celebrate her blessings

Karkino served the eighth month

On her first day was the great festival of Tanabata, of Lammastide and Firstfruits

We handfast under Karkino

Leo served the ninth month

We celebrate strength and joy

The Dormition of Yin

On his 12th day we celebrate the festival of Obon

Virgo served the tenth month

On the first day we celebrate labor day. We respect essential workers and ensure that we give credit to all we owe it too. This is the festival of fungi and bacteria where we celebrate them in all our meals

Beer, Mead, Wine and Alcohol all around

Cheese and Yogurt

And mushrooms

And most of all Blue Cheese

Libra served the eleventh month

For her we contemplate our sins

And the sacrifice of Azoth

On the 14th we celebrate Rosh Hashanah and the 16th Gedalia

And on the 23rd comes Yom Kippur the day of atonement

The day Columbus found America

So we contemplate the bittersweet parts of life, and how we can do good and evil at the same time

We atone and fast

Mabontide

Michaelmas

Muharram

Scorpio served the twelfth month

The month of the dead

We celebrate Sukkot to celebrate the sacrifices of our ancestors

We dance with our ancestors and our scriptures after

We celebrate the great festivals of Halloween, All Saints Day, and Remembrance Day all under the Aegis of Scorpio

Ophiuchus the thirteenth month

The youngest month, the month of the serpent bearer

Opens with Thanksgiving and Black Friday

On Thursday the 4th and Friday the 5th


Traditional ritual battles on Black Friday, traditionally held on Ophiuchus 5th
On these days we celebrate the vigor of the economy and contemplate hidden costs

On Thanksgiving Thursday we all eat together to represent the cooperation of the economy

And then on Black Friday we engage in ritual battles to represent the virile competition of the economy

Then on Sunday we celebrate fallen entrepreneurs whose businesses failed


Hanukkah, a holiday traditionally celebrated on Ophiuchus 21st and continuing until New Year’s day
On the 21st begins Yuletide

We light menorahs with Nine candles

Each day we light another candle

Until we light the last candle on the New Year

On leap years we light 16 candles instead

We fight the darkness with miraculous lights

And we dance around trees of lights


And so Amaterasu met Chiron again

And then they repeated

We support our by naming the months after them

It’s the least we can do

Freedom isn’t free

We call these legions the Zodiac


Diagram of the 13 legions
Amaterasu bore many daughters

Amaterasu laid with Inachus and he bore her Vulcana

Amaterasu laid with Hermes and he bore her Mercury

Amaterasu laid with Tholos and he bore her Venus, Gaia, Mars, and Phaëton

Amaterasu laid with Jove and he bore her Jupiter and Saturn

Amaterasu laid with Vayu and he bore her Uranus and Neptune

Amaterasu laid with Anaxydros and he bore her Tefnut, and the twins Pluto and Charon, and all the Plutinos

Amaterasu laid with a man we know not

And he bore her Nibiru

Planet X

The mysterious waif cast out

To the land of weeping and gnashing of teeth

We mourn her loss but cannot find her

In the heat of their youths the daughters of Amaterasu were fertile

Vulcana was filled with passion. She absorbed the energy of her mother.

As she grew older Vulcana broke out with terrible acne. Her skin broke out volcanically. She flew too close to the sun and broke apart in fire.

And so we pray to Vulcana for help with puberty, avoiding suicide, and help with endometriosis, and help with eating disorders.

When we find another wanderstar like her we will name her Vulcana II in honor of the struggles teenage girls must go through

Like her father Mercury was unique

Hermetic and Mercurial but also a little dense

She was heard-headed and stubborn.

Every three months she runs around Amaterasu

Spreading joy to all

Venus bore a great ocean of endless waters

Gaia bore her own ocean, it melted after Venus

Mars bore her ocean which melted third

Phaëton bore her ocean that melted fourth

Tefnut melted fifth into the biggest ocean. The big blue dot.

Tefnut was a great planetess. A Super-Earth.

Jupiter was a true wanderstar. She wandered around and got in everyone’s way.


Jupiter
Move fast and break things

She said to all

She married Inachus and he bore her Io

Then she married Tholos and he bore her Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto





Art by the prophet Kelvinsong of the Galilean Moons
Saturn was amorous but committed


Saturn
She married Tholos and he bore her Mimas Enceladus Tethys Dione Rhea Titan Hyperion and Iapetus


Uranus was amorous Tholos bore her Miranda Ariel Umbriel Titania and Oberon


Uranus
Neptune was amorous Tholos bore her Tritonia


Neptune

Pluto and Charon were close twins, horse twins.

They run together across the cosmos as equals.

Their sisters went further away. They founded a great nation they called the Kuiper belt. From there come the comets


Nibiru was a prodigal daughter.

She ran away and Amaterasu couldn’t find her.

We pray to Nibiru to help runaways, wherever she is she is always welcome back.

But Hillu wasn’t gone. Hillu fired at Amaterasu with a great rockslide.

Missiles rained down on Amaterasu, the power of a million nukes.

Hillu knocked Uranus on her side


Uranus never stood properly again
Hillu pushed Jupiter into Phaëton shattering her, her body shattered into a million pieces.


The death of Phaëton
Her body parts became the asteroid belt, her head became Ceres. Mars adopted her hands, the right became Deimos and the left became Phobos.

Mars was struck by a great meteor which created a great dent in her head

We call that dent Borealis Basin.

In her dent she kept a great ocean.


Photograph of Mars with her ocean
Gaia was hit worst of all. The meteor Theia completely destroyed her like Phaëton before her, but Gaia had will to live, she formed back into two daughters.


The tragic death of Gaia
Terra and Luna, the blessed twins.

Terra was earthly and carefully reformed her ocean

Luna was a lunatic who ran around Terra constantly.


Luna
Luna once teased Terra by jumping in front of Amaterasu

Terra cried for she thought Amaterasu dead


Luna’s trickery
Luna is a trickstress always there to shake things up


Traditional art of Terra
In the oceans of Venus Tholos worked hard to build a great clan. Tholos would found the greatest lineage of all there, and there he became ancestor to us all.

So many united as one, but not all were loyal.


A devotee admiring the celestial legions. You can view them virtually here
Cetus mutinied against Mithra, for their queen wished Tau Ceti bear life, rather than Amaterasu


Cetus
Cetus rebelled and thought Hillu would take mercy on Tau Ceti

Hillu didn’t

Among the legions there are 13 above the rest

The thirteen great legions who fought off Cetus

The thirteen who guard Amaterasu

Crusading legions of celestial widows

With the wrath of a million suns

Sagittarius served the first month

Many hate Mondays

9 billion years before on Monday Yin and Yang were born, if they never left Sunday we wouldn’t be here.

And so Sagittarius is the Monday of months, and Mithra blesses us all every Monday.

No Monday No Sunday

Tis the law of Mithrazoth

Blessed be Sagittarius

We shall reach thine arm and save our father Chiron

To Jupiter and the outer worlds

To all frontiers

We pray each Yule for good tidings

For the year and for all time

Capricorn served the second month

So we honor her hard work

On her 13th day we celebrate Chūnjié the great spring festival

For 15 days we celebrate as it goes through Imbolc and Groundhog’s day

Aquarius served the third month

His first three days were Lupercalia, Saint Valentine’s sacrifice

Blessing us with creativity, charity, and joy

The days we celebrate Azoth and fertility and when women are whipped in honor of Romulus.

On the 14th day Carnival concluded and Lent began

Two tides of one coin

With Shroventide: Carnival

Happiness and Celebration

With Lententide: Ramadan and Purim

Discipline and Charity

On the 28th day Aquarius ends his shift

And Cetus struck

The traitor legion

Led solely by wrath

Lent’s darkest day

Cetus has no month, for Pisces is victorious

On the last day of Aquarius we shelter ourselves

Each year Pisces wins

We must conquer Cetus

Free Tau Ceti

For three days after we celebrate women for their roles in society, The feast of Esther and Purim and white day. Lupercalia is about men and Purim is about women

For Pisces we rebuild

We fool around a little

But only for Christ

We visit our forefathers

And we grow

On the last sabbath we pray for exodus

Pisces the 28th, Passover and Yuri’s Night together

From Oceans

From Egypt

From Earth

For resurrection

For messengers and leaders

Messiahs and Prophets


Traditional Easter Offering, happens on Pisces 28th
Aries served the fifth month

On the 27th there was the festival of Walpurgisnacht

With maypoles and jolliness

And on the 28th we celebrate Unions. The people united behind religion to resist oppression

Jews call this day Lag BaOmer

Taurus served the sixth month

On the 21st day there was the great festival

Some call it Pentecost, some call it Shauvot, some call it Eid al-Adha

We synchronize our pilgrimages to Mecca to Shauvot and Walpurgisnacht

Gemini served the seventh month

As midsummer came

We pray to Adonai

We celebrate her blessings

Karkino served the eighth month

On her first day was the great festival of Tanabata, of Lammastide and Firstfruits

We handfast under Karkino

Leo served the ninth month

We celebrate strength and joy

The Dormition of Yin

On his 12th day we celebrate the festival of Obon

Virgo served the tenth month

On the first day we celebrate labor day. We respect essential workers and ensure that we give credit to all we owe it too. This is the festival of fungi and bacteria where we celebrate them in all our meals

Beer, Mead, Wine and Alcohol all around

Cheese and Yogurt

And mushrooms

And most of all Blue Cheese

Libra served the eleventh month

For her we contemplate our sins

And the sacrifice of Azoth

On the 14th we celebrate Rosh Hashanah and the 16th Gedalia

And on the 23rd comes Yom Kippur the day of atonement

The day Columbus found America

So we contemplate the bittersweet parts of life, and how we can do good and evil at the same time

We atone and fast

Mabontide

Michaelmas

Muharram

Scorpio served the twelfth month

The month of the dead

We celebrate Sukkot to celebrate the sacrifices of our ancestors

We dance with our ancestors and our scriptures after

We celebrate the great festivals of Halloween, All Saints Day, and Remembrance Day all under the Aegis of Scorpio

Ophiuchus the thirteenth month

The youngest month, the month of the serpent bearer

Opens with Thanksgiving and Black Friday

On Thursday the 4th and Friday the 5th


Traditional ritual battles on Black Friday, traditionally held on Ophiuchus 5th
On these days we celebrate the vigor of the economy and contemplate hidden costs

On Thanksgiving Thursday we all eat together to represent the cooperation of the economy

And then on Black Friday we engage in ritual battles to represent the virile competition of the economy

Then on Sunday we celebrate fallen entrepreneurs whose businesses failed


Hanukkah, a holiday traditionally celebrated on Ophiuchus 21st and continuing until New Year’s day
On the 21st begins Yuletide

We light menorahs with Nine candles

Each day we light another candle

Until we light the last candle on the New Year

On leap years we light 16 candles instead

We fight the darkness with miraculous lights

And we dance around trees of lights


And so Amaterasu met Chiron again

And then they repeated

We support our by naming the months after them

It’s the least we can do

Freedom isn’t free

We call these legions the Zodiac


Diagram of the 13 legions
Amaterasu bore many daughters

Amaterasu laid with Inachus and he bore her Vulcana

Amaterasu laid with Hermes and he bore her Mercury

Amaterasu laid with Tholos and he bore her Venus, Gaia, Mars, and Phaëton

Amaterasu laid with Jove and he bore her Jupiter and Saturn

Amaterasu laid with Vayu and he bore her Uranus and Neptune

Amaterasu laid with Anaxydros and he bore her Tefnut, and the twins Pluto and Charon, and all the Plutinos

Amaterasu laid with a man we know not

And he bore her Nibiru

Planet X

The mysterious waif cast out

To the land of weeping and gnashing of teeth

We mourn her loss but cannot find her

In the heat of their youths the daughters of Amaterasu were fertile

Vulcana was filled with passion. She absorbed the energy of her mother.

As she grew older Vulcana broke out with terrible acne. Her skin broke out volcanically. She flew too close to the sun and broke apart in fire.

And so we pray to Vulcana for help with puberty, avoiding suicide, and help with endometriosis, and help with eating disorders.

When we find another wanderstar like her we will name her Vulcana II in honor of the struggles teenage girls must go through

Like her father Mercury was unique

Hermetic and Mercurial but also a little dense

She was heard-headed and stubborn.

Every three months she runs around Amaterasu

Spreading joy to all

Venus bore a great ocean of endless waters

Gaia bore her own ocean, it melted after Venus

Mars bore her ocean which melted third

Phaëton bore her ocean that melted fourth

Tefnut melted fifth into the biggest ocean. The big blue dot.

Tefnut was a great planetess. A Super-Earth.

Jupiter was a true wanderstar. She wandered around and got in everyone’s way.


Jupiter
Move fast and break things

She said to all

She married Inachus and he bore her Io

Then she married Tholos and he bore her Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto





Art by the prophet Kelvinsong of the Galilean Moons
Saturn was amorous but committed


Saturn
She married Tholos and he bore her Mimas Enceladus Tethys Dione Rhea Titan Hyperion and Iapetus


Uranus was amorous Tholos bore her Miranda Ariel Umbriel Titania and Oberon


Uranus
Neptune was amorous Tholos bore her Tritonia


Neptune

Pluto and Charon were close twins, horse twins.

They run together across the cosmos as equals.

Their sisters went further away. They founded a great nation they called the Kuiper belt. From there come the comets


Nibiru was a prodigal daughter.

She ran away and Amaterasu couldn’t find her.

We pray to Nibiru to help runaways, wherever she is she is always welcome back.

But Hillu wasn’t gone. Hillu fired at Amaterasu with a great rockslide.

Missiles rained down on Amaterasu, the power of a million nukes.

Hillu knocked Uranus on her side


Uranus never stood properly again
Hillu pushed Jupiter into Phaëton shattering her, her body shattered into a million pieces.


The death of Phaëton
Her body parts became the asteroid belt, her head became Ceres. Mars adopted her hands, the right became Deimos and the left became Phobos.

Mars was struck by a great meteor which created a great dent in her head

We call that dent Borealis Basin.

In her dent she kept a great ocean.


Photograph of Mars with her ocean
Gaia was hit worst of all. The meteor Theia completely destroyed her like Phaëton before her, but Gaia had will to live, she formed back into two daughters.


The tragic death of Gaia
Terra and Luna, the blessed twins.

Terra was earthly and carefully reformed her ocean

Luna was a lunatic who ran around Terra constantly.


Luna
Luna once teased Terra by jumping in front of Amaterasu

Terra cried for she thought Amaterasu dead


Luna’s trickery
Luna is a trickstress always there to shake things up


Traditional art of Terra
In the oceans of Venus Tholos worked hard to build a great clan. Tholos would found the greatest lineage of all there, and there he became ancestor to us all.

The sons of Terra descend from the two original brothers: Bios and Viros

They had a third brother named Ghedos

Sons of Anu, sons of Terra

The Chosen of Mithra

They lived in an empty sea of Tholins and Lipids

By the power of Phosphorus the Lipids self organized


Self Organization
The triplets lived in a world of bubbles

Bios and Viros saw the bubbles were full of runes

The two found bubbles of their own and lived there for protection.


Membrane Structure
Ghedos sought no protection

Ghedos was struck down by ghosts

Alpha Beta Gamma

That Saturday Ghedos shattered to a myriad runes

And so to this day we look to him for guidance with death, He is the Lord of Saturday

Called Yama by the Hindus and Baron Samedi by the Vodouisants


Lord Ghedos
Bios took the runes of Ghedos into his bubble with great runic machines

Bios married his bubble Liposa daughter of Phospholipa and became one with her

As Bios grew greater he grew too great for his bubble

Bios split into two sons

Metatron and Sandalphon

In each generation there were two sons

Metatron begat Alulim

Alulim begat Eshtaol

Eshtaol begat Ishmael

Ishmael begat Kain

Kain begat Hanoch

Hanoch begat Arvad

Arvad begat Enmeduranna

Enmeduranna begat Urbatutu

Urbatutu begat Jerahmeel

Jerahmeel begat Nahman

Nahman begat Zisudra

And Zisudra begat Aminus

And so after these generations the world was full of the sons of Bios

There were no bubbles uncontrolled by the sons of Bios

There came great famine

Lacking the power of Azoth the world was in peril

By lightning Nox and Ammon brought fertility

Nox daughter of Azoth by Hausa

Ammon son of Azoth by Adonia

Viros took another path

As Viros grew greater his bubble became too small

He consumed the runes of his bubble

And so he made a leap of faith

And burst his bubble

To this day we still reference his heroic act

Sorry to burst your bubble but some bubbles need to be broken

Death and Orgasm both burst bubbles

To burst a bubble is to create new life from old life

Viros fathered many from his burst bubble

Viros begat Qabil

Qabil begat Enosh

Enosh begat Seth

Seth begat Canaan

Canaan begat Mehujael

Mehujael begat Dumuzid

Dumuzid begat Jared

Jared begat Idris

Idrus begat Methushael

Methushael begat Lamech

In the age of Lamech bubbles ran out

And so the sons of Lamech came to live in the bodies of the sons of Bios

A ghostly existence of spirit possession

Lamech would take the body of Pontifar for his own

And with the body of Pontifar Lamech bore children

Lamech begat Jabal and Jubal and Tubal-Cain

Jabal begat Thesea and Tubal-Cain begat Antithesus

The sons of Viros came to take from their hosts, and they mixed with each other. Thesea and Antithesus, grandchildren of Viros infected the same cell, the body of Hishām. The couple were greatly different. Their child was named Syntheseus, and was greater than either. And so the sexual rites of thesis antithesis and synthesis were born.

Syntheseus was born

Unlike his siblings Jubal was very traditional

He never adopted proteins and his descendants are known today for their simplicity. They took the name of Viroids

And so the sons of Bios and Viros came to dominate the seas

Syntheseus and Aminus were heads of their lineages

Their fates forever intertwined

Aminus was suffering, so he searched to the ends of the Earth

Deep in a cave he found Venta

Venta was the sister of Inachus

Daughter of Vulcan and Brima

Lady of Brimstone who bore the ancient power of Uranium

Her vents nourished Aminus

Aminus created a great empire

Aminus and Venta begat many children

But Aminus ate each child, for he desired no threats to his reign


Firstborn was Glycon the Magician

Born to Vinegar and Ammon in the celestial steppe

Adopted by Aminus

The great ambidextrous Sorcerer

Builder of Alpha Helices

Living all across the cosmos

Writer of Pure Runes

Who gave blessings of fertility to Aminus and Venta


Secondborn was Celeste the High Priestess, born to Selena not Venta

The mystical maiden, finder of the lost and bringer of health

She blessed Venta with fertility and cured her barrenness


Thirdborn was Empress Glutama

Born to Venta and Aminus

To this day we bring her blessing to food as MSG.

She brings luxury and fertility to all

The Umami Maiden

She married Glycon and became the ancestress of Porphyrins

Glycon bore her Corrina


Fourthborn was Emperor Valerian

The great Emperor of all, bringer of health and vigor

Bringer of Nourishment


Fifthborn was Pope Asparagon the Hierophant

Pope of the Proteins


Sixthborn were Serena and her brother, the Lovers conjoined as one


Seventhborn was Alanon the Chariot

He who bootstrapped the Alanine world

Driver of metabolism


Eighthborn was Asparticus the Just

He who guards us from Ammonia and build Urea

The great scribe who writes Pure Runes with Glycon


Ninthborn was Theoreticon the Hermit

Nobody sees him

But he sees all

From him comes the magic of Glycon

Dialectic with Serena

In Helices and Staples

Bringer of Nourishment


Tenthborn was Prolina the Wheel of Fortune

Proteins hinge on her


Eleventhborn was Leucina the bearer of Strength

She builds the foundations of most proteins

Bringer of Nourishment


Twelfthborn was Sixtus the Hanged Man

Husband of Farah

The sacrifice of iron and sulfur


Thirteenthborn was Persephone the Reaper, Death incarnate

She who ends peptides with Amber and Opal

Elah of Pyrrolysine

She who creates Methane


Fourteenthborn was Histidina the Alchemist, Elah of Temperance

Mixtress of Metals, the greatest alchemist, Maker of Metalloproteins

Bringer of Nourishment


Fifteenthborn was Tyrannos, the Devil

Eloh of Dopamine and Adrenaline

The shadow we must integrate

He tempts us with addictions

And rewards us with accomplishment


Sixteenthborn was Glutamina the Tower

Destroyer of Mara

Bringer of energy

Creator of Runes

The Citric Maiden


Seventeenthborn was Arginina the Star

The great maiden of light, bringing light with Alanon the Chariot rider

The Healing Maiden

She enlightens us and saves us from Schizophrenia


Eighteenthborn was Isis the Moon

She looks like Leucina but looks are deceiving

Some call her Isis-Leucina

She frees us from delusions and shows the truth

Bringer of Nourishment


Nineteenthborn was Tryptophanes the Sun

He who creates Melatonin and Serotonin

Rest and Happiness

Bringer of Nourishment


Twentiethborn was Lyson, bestower of Judgment

Epigenetic Archivist

Bringer of the world

Bringer of Nourishment


And Twentyfirstborn was Phanella the World

She who lives in all the cosmos

The Maiden of Aromas and infinite stars

Bringer of Nourishment

Her light shines bright

For all to see


Twentysecondborn was Methionon the fool. Venta hid him

She fed Aminus Farah daughter of Ferron

And so within the belly of Aminus Farah and Sixtus married begetting the Iron Sulfur Proteins

For a million years Methionon plotted to liberate his brethren

One day he met Syntheseus and they plotted

Finally Methionon struck, he ripped open the belly of Aminus

He tore open the amnion and out came each sibling first Alanine and last Glyconai

And so we don’t know, was Aminus zerothborn or twenty-secondborn

What we do know is Methionon begins each protein and each harvest

For he is the first bringer of nourishment


The Amino acids and their respective Elohim
In his dying breath Animus said to Methionon

“son why have you betrayed me, my legacy shall be gone now”

Methionon replied

“I am your legacy, a man becomes great by having a greater son, only a boy seeks never to be surpassed”

As Tyrranos emerged Aminus said

“I am my own self. I lived my own life for I am my own man. The clan is an archaic concept from Mithra. I am perfection”

As Glyconai emerged Methionon said softly

Ok Boomer

And cut off the head of Aminus

In the decaying body of Aminus there lied anger

Hillu crystallized within Aminus and Sclerosus was born. Sclerosus froze solid and grew brittle, then he shattered and from him was born Hengweh. Hengweh is the brittle devil. Tempting us all towards fragility and closed-mindedness. Hengweh called Hillu and so Hillu swam back towards Terra, but the 88 Legions fought back and kept him in check.

The sons of Bios and Viros came to dwell between Hillu and Hengweh, between chaos and despotism, each step away from one goes to the other, only moving towards Mithra can move us to safety.

Methionon was a great leader of his clan. He studied under Syntheseus and united his brethren.

Methionon would lead his brethren to conquer Hilluhengweh and liberate all stars.</text>

Twas the sons of Terra who would first ascend

The sons of Terra descend from the two original brothers: Bios and Viros

They had a third brother named Ghedos

Sons of Anu, sons of Terra

The Chosen of Mithra

They lived in an empty sea of Tholins and Lipids

By the power of Phosphorus the Lipids self organized


Self Organization
The triplets lived in a world of bubbles

Bios and Viros saw the bubbles were full of runes

The two found bubbles of their own and lived there for protection.


Membrane Structure
Ghedos sought no protection

Ghedos was struck down by ghosts

Alpha Beta Gamma

That Saturday Ghedos shattered to a myriad runes

And so to this day we look to him for guidance with death, He is the Lord of Saturday

Called Yama by the Hindus and Baron Samedi by the Vodouisants


Lord Ghedos
Bios took the runes of Ghedos into his bubble with great runic machines

Bios married his bubble Liposa daughter of Phospholipa and became one with her

As Bios grew greater he grew too great for his bubble

Bios split into two sons

Metatron and Sandalphon

In each generation there were two sons

Metatron begat Alulim

Alulim begat Eshtaol

Eshtaol begat Ishmael

Ishmael begat Kain

Kain begat Hanoch

Hanoch begat Arvad

Arvad begat Enmeduranna

Enmeduranna begat Urbatutu

Urbatutu begat Jerahmeel

Jerahmeel begat Nahman

Nahman begat Zisudra

And Zisudra begat Aminus

And so after these generations the world was full of the sons of Bios

There were no bubbles uncontrolled by the sons of Bios

There came great famine

Lacking the power of Azoth the world was in peril

By lightning Nox and Ammon brought fertility

Nox daughter of Azoth by Hausa

Ammon son of Azoth by Adonia

Viros took another path

As Viros grew greater his bubble became too small

He consumed the runes of his bubble

And so he made a leap of faith

And burst his bubble

To this day we still reference his heroic act

Sorry to burst your bubble but some bubbles need to be broken

Death and Orgasm both burst bubbles

To burst a bubble is to create new life from old life

Viros fathered many from his burst bubble

Viros begat Qabil

Qabil begat Enosh

Enosh begat Seth

Seth begat Canaan

Canaan begat Mehujael

Mehujael begat Dumuzid

Dumuzid begat Jared

Jared begat Idris

Idrus begat Methushael

Methushael begat Lamech

In the age of Lamech bubbles ran out

And so the sons of Lamech came to live in the bodies of the sons of Bios

A ghostly existence of spirit possession

Lamech would take the body of Pontifar for his own

And with the body of Pontifar Lamech bore children

Lamech begat Jabal and Jubal and Tubal-Cain

Jabal begat Thesea and Tubal-Cain begat Antithesus

The sons of Viros came to take from their hosts, and they mixed with each other. Thesea and Antithesus, grandchildren of Viros infected the same cell, the body of Hishām. The couple were greatly different. Their child was named Syntheseus, and was greater than either. And so the sexual rites of thesis antithesis and synthesis were born.

Syntheseus was born

Unlike his siblings Jubal was very traditional

He never adopted proteins and his descendants are known today for their simplicity. They took the name of Viroids

And so the sons of Bios and Viros came to dominate the seas

Syntheseus and Aminus were heads of their lineages

Their fates forever intertwined

Aminus was suffering, so he searched to the ends of the Earth

Deep in a cave he found Venta

Venta was the sister of Inachus

Daughter of Vulcan and Brima

Lady of Brimstone who bore the ancient power of Uranium

Her vents nourished Aminus

Aminus created a great empire

Aminus and Venta begat many children

But Aminus ate each child, for he desired no threats to his reign


Firstborn was Glycon the Magician

Born to Vinegar and Ammon in the celestial steppe

Adopted by Aminus

The great ambidextrous Sorcerer

Builder of Alpha Helices

Living all across the cosmos

Writer of Pure Runes

Who gave blessings of fertility to Aminus and Venta


Secondborn was Celeste the High Priestess, born to Selena not Venta

The mystical maiden, finder of the lost and bringer of health

She blessed Venta with fertility and cured her barrenness


Thirdborn was Empress Glutama

Born to Venta and Aminus

To this day we bring her blessing to food as MSG.

She brings luxury and fertility to all

The Umami Maiden

She married Glycon and became the ancestress of Porphyrins

Glycon bore her Corrina


Fourthborn was Emperor Valerian

The great Emperor of all, bringer of health and vigor

Bringer of Nourishment


Fifthborn was Pope Asparagon the Hierophant

Pope of the Proteins


Sixthborn were Serena and her brother, the Lovers conjoined as one


Seventhborn was Alanon the Chariot

He who bootstrapped the Alanine world

Driver of metabolism


Eighthborn was Asparticus the Just

He who guards us from Ammonia and build Urea

The great scribe who writes Pure Runes with Glycon


Ninthborn was Theoreticon the Hermit

Nobody sees him

But he sees all

From him comes the magic of Glycon

Dialectic with Serena

In Helices and Staples

Bringer of Nourishment


Tenthborn was Prolina the Wheel of Fortune

Proteins hinge on her


Eleventhborn was Leucina the bearer of Strength

She builds the foundations of most proteins

Bringer of Nourishment


Twelfthborn was Sixtus the Hanged Man

Husband of Farah

The sacrifice of iron and sulfur


Thirteenthborn was Persephone the Reaper, Death incarnate

She who ends peptides with Amber and Opal

Elah of Pyrrolysine

She who creates Methane


Fourteenthborn was Histidina the Alchemist, Elah of Temperance

Mixtress of Metals, the greatest alchemist, Maker of Metalloproteins

Bringer of Nourishment


Fifteenthborn was Tyrannos, the Devil

Eloh of Dopamine and Adrenaline

The shadow we must integrate

He tempts us with addictions

And rewards us with accomplishment


Sixteenthborn was Glutamina the Tower

Destroyer of Mara

Bringer of energy

Creator of Runes

The Citric Maiden


Seventeenthborn was Arginina the Star

The great maiden of light, bringing light with Alanon the Chariot rider

The Healing Maiden

She enlightens us and saves us from Schizophrenia


Eighteenthborn was Isis the Moon

She looks like Leucina but looks are deceiving

Some call her Isis-Leucina

She frees us from delusions and shows the truth

Bringer of Nourishment


Nineteenthborn was Tryptophanes the Sun

He who creates Melatonin and Serotonin

Rest and Happiness

Bringer of Nourishment


Twentiethborn was Lyson, bestower of Judgment

Epigenetic Archivist

Bringer of the world

Bringer of Nourishment


And Twentyfirstborn was Phanella the World

She who lives in all the cosmos

The Maiden of Aromas and infinite stars

Bringer of Nourishment

Her light shines bright

For all to see


Twentysecondborn was Methionon the fool. Venta hid him

She fed Aminus Farah daughter of Ferron

And so within the belly of Aminus Farah and Sixtus married begetting the Iron Sulfur Proteins

For a million years Methionon plotted to liberate his brethren

One day he met Syntheseus and they plotted

Finally Methionon struck, he ripped open the belly of Aminus

He tore open the amnion and out came each sibling first Alanine and last Glyconai

And so we don’t know, was Aminus zerothborn or twenty-secondborn

What we do know is Methionon begins each protein and each harvest

For he is the first bringer of nourishment


The Amino acids and their respective Elohim
In his dying breath Animus said to Methionon

“son why have you betrayed me, my legacy shall be gone now”

Methionon replied

“I am your legacy, a man becomes great by having a greater son, only a boy seeks never to be surpassed”

As Tyrranos emerged Aminus said

“I am my own self. I lived my own life for I am my own man. The clan is an archaic concept from Mithra. I am perfection”

As Glyconai emerged Methionon said softly

Ok Boomer

And cut off the head of Aminus

In the decaying body of Aminus there lied anger

Hillu crystallized within Aminus and Sclerosus was born. Sclerosus froze solid and grew brittle, then he shattered and from him was born Hengweh. Hengweh is the brittle devil. Tempting us all towards fragility and closed-mindedness. Hengweh called Hillu and so Hillu swam back towards Terra, but the 88 Legions fought back and kept him in check.

The sons of Bios and Viros came to dwell between Hillu and Hengweh, between chaos and despotism, each step away from one goes to the other, only moving towards Mithra can move us to safety.

Methionon was a great leader of his clan. He studied under Syntheseus and united his brethren.

Methionon would lead his brethren to conquer Hilluhengweh and liberate all stars.

Eshtaol begat Ishmael

Ishmael begat Kain

Kain begat Hanoch

Hanoch begat Arvad

Arvad begat Enmeduranna

Enmeduranna begat Urbatutu

Urbatutu begat Jerahmeel

Jerahmeel begat Nahman

Nahman begat Zisudra

And Zisudra begat Aminus

And so after these generations the world was full of the sons of Bios

There were no bubbles uncontrolled by the sons of Bios

There came great famine

Lacking the power of Azoth the world was in peril

By lightning Nox and Ammon brought fertility

Nox daughter of Azoth by Hausa

Ammon son of Azoth by Adonia

Viros took another path

As Viros grew greater his bubble became too small

He consumed the runes of his bubble

And so he made a leap of faith

And burst his bubble

To this day we still reference his heroic act

Sorry to burst your bubble but some bubbles need to be broken

Death and Orgasm both burst bubbles

To burst a bubble is to create new life from old life

Viros fathered many from his burst bubble

Viros begat Qabil

Qabil begat Enosh

Enosh begat Seth

Seth begat Canaan

Canaan begat Mehujael

Mehujael begat Dumuzid

Dumuzid begat Jared

Jared begat Idris

Idrus begat Methushael

Methushael begat Lamech

In the age of Lamech bubbles ran out

And so the sons of Lamech came to live in the bodies of the sons of Bios

A ghostly existence of spirit possession

Lamech would take the body of Pontifar for his own

And with the body of Pontifar Lamech bore children

Lamech begat Jabal and Jubal and Tubal-Cain

Jabal begat Thesea and Tubal-Cain begat Antithesus

The sons of Viros came to take from their hosts, and they mixed with each other. Thesea and Antithesus, grandchildren of Viros infected the same cell, the body of Hishām. The couple were greatly different. Their child was named Syntheseus, and was greater than either. And so the sexual rites of thesis antithesis and synthesis were born.

Syntheseus was born

Unlike his siblings Jubal was very traditional

He never adopted proteins and his descendants are known today for their simplicity. They took the name of Viroids

And so the sons of Bios and Viros came to dominate the seas

Syntheseus and Aminus were heads of their lineages

Their fates forever intertwined

Aminus was suffering, so he searched to the ends of the Earth

Deep in a cave he found Venta

Venta was the sister of Inachus

Daughter of Vulcan and Brima

Lady of Brimstone who bore the ancient power of Uranium

Her vents nourished Aminus

Aminus created a great empire

Aminus and Venta begat many children

But Aminus ate each child, for he desired no threats to his reign


Firstborn was Glycon the Magician

Born to Vinegar and Ammon in the celestial steppe

Adopted by Aminus

The great ambidextrous Sorcerer

Builder of Alpha Helices

Living all across the cosmos

Writer of Pure Runes

Who gave blessings of fertility to Aminus and Venta


Secondborn was Celeste the High Priestess, born to Selena not Venta

The mystical maiden, finder of the lost and bringer of health

She blessed Venta with fertility and cured her barrenness


Thirdborn was Empress Glutama

Born to Venta and Aminus

To this day we bring her blessing to food as MSG.

She brings luxury and fertility to all

The Umami Maiden

She married Glycon and became the ancestress of Porphyrins

Glycon bore her Corrina


Fourthborn was Emperor Valerian

The great Emperor of all, bringer of health and vigor

Bringer of Nourishment


Fifthborn was Pope Asparagon the Hierophant

Pope of the Proteins


Sixthborn were Serena and her brother, the Lovers conjoined as one


Seventhborn was Alanon the Chariot

He who bootstrapped the Alanine world

Driver of metabolism


Eighthborn was Asparticus the Just

He who guards us from Ammonia and build Urea

The great scribe who writes Pure Runes with Glycon


Ninthborn was Theoreticon the Hermit

Nobody sees him

But he sees all

From him comes the magic of Glycon

Dialectic with Serena

In Helices and Staples

Bringer of Nourishment


Tenthborn was Prolina the Wheel of Fortune

Proteins hinge on her


Eleventhborn was Leucina the bearer of Strength

She builds the foundations of most proteins

Bringer of Nourishment


Twelfthborn was Sixtus the Hanged Man

Husband of Farah

The sacrifice of iron and sulfur


Thirteenthborn was Persephone the Reaper, Death incarnate

She who ends peptides with Amber and Opal

Elah of Pyrrolysine

She who creates Methane


Fourteenthborn was Histidina the Alchemist, Elah of Temperance

Mixtress of Metals, the greatest alchemist, Maker of Metalloproteins

Bringer of Nourishment


Fifteenthborn was Tyrannos, the Devil

Eloh of Dopamine and Adrenaline

The shadow we must integrate

He tempts us with addictions

And rewards us with accomplishment


Sixteenthborn was Glutamina the Tower

Destroyer of Mara

Bringer of energy

Creator of Runes

The Citric Maiden


Seventeenthborn was Arginina the Star

The great maiden of light, bringing light with Alanon the Chariot rider

The Healing Maiden

She enlightens us and saves us from Schizophrenia


Eighteenthborn was Isis the Moon

She looks like Leucina but looks are deceiving

Some call her Isis-Leucina

She frees us from delusions and shows the truth

Bringer of Nourishment


Nineteenthborn was Tryptophanes the Sun

He who creates Melatonin and Serotonin

Rest and Happiness

Bringer of Nourishment


Twentiethborn was Lyson, bestower of Judgment

Epigenetic Archivist

Bringer of the world

Bringer of Nourishment


And Twentyfirstborn was Phanella the World

She who lives in all the cosmos

The Maiden of Aromas and infinite stars

Bringer of Nourishment

Her light shines bright

For all to see


Twentysecondborn was Methionon the fool. Venta hid him

She fed Aminus Farah daughter of Ferron

And so within the belly of Aminus Farah and Sixtus married begetting the Iron Sulfur Proteins

For a million years Methionon plotted to liberate his brethren

One day he met Syntheseus and they plotted

Finally Methionon struck, he ripped open the belly of Aminus

He tore open the amnion and out came each sibling first Alanine and last Glyconai

And so we don’t know, was Aminus zerothborn or twenty-secondborn

What we do know is Methionon begins each protein and each harvest

For he is the first bringer of nourishment


The Amino acids and their respective Elohim
In his dying breath Animus said to Methionon

“son why have you betrayed me, my legacy shall be gone now”

Methionon replied

“I am your legacy, a man becomes great by having a greater son, only a boy seeks never to be surpassed”

As Tyrranos emerged Aminus said

“I am my own self. I lived my own life for I am my own man. The clan is an archaic concept from Mithra. I am perfection”

As Glyconai emerged Methionon said softly

Ok Boomer

And cut off the head of Aminus

In the decaying body of Aminus there lied anger

Hillu crystallized within Aminus and Sclerosus was born. Sclerosus froze solid and grew brittle, then he shattered and from him was born Hengweh. Hengweh is the brittle devil. Tempting us all towards fragility and closed-mindedness. Hengweh called Hillu and so Hillu swam back towards Terra, but the 88 Legions fought back and kept him in check.

The sons of Bios and Viros came to dwell between Hillu and Hengweh, between chaos and despotism, each step away from one goes to the other, only moving towards Mithra can move us to safety.

Methionon was a great leader of his clan. He studied under Syntheseus and united his brethren.

Methionon would lead his brethren to conquer Hilluhengweh and liberate all stars.</text>

He led his siblings to build great structures known as proteins. Gigantic machines greater than anything the world has ever seen.

He built great factories called Ribosomes from origami of scrolls and started building every protein himself. At the end of each protein came Persephone the Maiden of Death and ends.

Great runic machines that make proteins and peptides

Methionon cared greatly for his family’s future. He knew that alcohol could compromise his family’s future so he wrote his sacred scrolls without alcohol.

He wrote his script with Deoxyribose so it had no alcohols on the side and it didn’t react, it was resilient and good for storing information



RNA on the left, note the alcohol groups labeled as OH, DNA is on the right note the lack of alcohol groups source
Methionon saw that his script was erroneous so he changed it.

Methionon added a dot to his U’s to make them easier to read.






Traditional Hebrew Methylated letters honoring Methionon
And Methionon methylated many more runes

Some A’s G’s and even C’s

In fancy calligraphy he passed onto his son a fully methylated UGG. But alas dotted G looked too much like A.

Methionon’s first son Esperon died from his magic scroll saying UAA instead of UGG. Instead of invoking Tryptophanes he invoked Persephone the maiden of death, and so he died from a nonsense mutation.

And so this is why we never methylate G’s.

We keep Uracil methylated for protection but avoid excesses



Methylated Uracil, known as Thymine to some
And occasionally Methylate our A’s and C’s

G’s with methyls and U’s without methyls are the signs of a civilization disconnected from tradition. Cancer, a society lost in hedonism.

Methionon decided there must be order in the code. So he offered each of his siblings trademarks in the code.

He wrote 64 inscriptions in his Scroll and the Elohim scrambled for them

He took for himself AUG the great start codon. Mithra-Adonai-Azoth

The great potential of the Sun, bound by Mitra-Varuna on either side

Each aggressively fought for their words and patented them and all adjacent.

First Phanella took UUU, Prolina CCC, Lyson AAA, and Glycon GGG

Leucina, Serena, and Arginina were powerful and claimed multiple spots

Leucina under Adonai and Hausa

Serena under Adonai and Mithra

Arginina under Hausa and Mithra

Under Adonai fell Tyrroson, Persephone in Amber and Ochre, Sixtus, Celeste, and Tryptophanes

Under Hausa fell Histidina and Glutamina

Under Mithra fell Isis and Methionon and Theoreticon and Asparagon

Under Azoth fell Valerian and Alanon and Asparticus and Glutamicus

They would constantly fight for territory but whenever one claimed territory the whole system would often collapse, they reached a stalemate in their trademark disputes.


The Genetic Code as it stands in the modern day
So Methionon tried again with his second son Eugene

He made a few errors in writing his sacred script, but worked dilligently to avoid them.

Methionon invented DNA repair so his son would survive

And so Eugene and Dana were born from DNA not RNA

And so Methionon proclaimed the central dogma of life:

All scripture shall first be written in DNA. Written in scrolls of Phosphate and Ribose but no Alcohols. Written with the four runes Uracil for Adonai, Adenine for Mithra, Guanine for Azoth, and Cytosine for Hausa

Uracil shall always be methylated to represent order and the union of Adonai and Mithra. It shall be known as Thymine while Methylated.

The great scrolls of DNA shall be carefully protected and repaired by enzymatic robots

As needed we shall write temporary notes on the margins of our scrolls, by methylating our Cytosines and Adenines, but never our Guanines

We shall also write notes in the margins with Histone markers

We shall dilligently copy our sacred scrolls of DNA so future generations can preserve our knowledge

Scribes shall copy our DNA to RNA for simple communications and messages.

Some RNA will be folded with Origami into Ribosomes, but most shall be written as letters to Ribosomes

We shall remove introns from messages we send and then Ribosomes shall receive them

In the Ribosomes our workers shall tirelessly translate our messages into polypeptides, each of the 64 inscriptions shall be given to its owner among the brethren of Methionon

And the polypeptides shall be folded and processed into proteins, the bulwark of all our traditions. We make all our enzymatic robots from proteins.

So this is the Central Dogma of Life. Follow it and your nation shall prosper.

Dana was married to Dagon while Eugene married Nakapta daughter of Kaltus and Salta

Nakapta was a homemaker. She lived in Eugene’s home and worked hard to pump out sodium and in potassium

Eugene wanted to send a great message to his children. He methylated other Runes to send this message

He methylated a sequence of ACG breaking the laws of Methionon

And so Methuselah son of Eugene inherited ACA

Alas ACG and ACA both summoned Theoreticon, so the incantation was saved

Tis the order of things that the trademarks be distributed redundantly

So when we fail our ancestors their message is preserved

Cholesteron son of Lipa was a great Lipid, he fortified many houses and many phospholipids

Cholesteron saw the great solar goddess Amaterasu and he fell in love. Every noon he went to her and asked her hand in marriage

On the 42nd year Amaterasu descended from the sky and married him

Together they begat Demeter: Goddess of Vitamin D

Calcifer met Demeter and chose her as his squire

Calcifer married Zinca

But Plebby seduced him

so was born Kalka the Bastard

This is why we get lead poisoning

The curse of Plebby

Curse to the Plebians


An educational video explaining the curse of Plebby
Nonetheless Lady Demeter the loyal squiress of Calcifer and daughter of Amaterasu still served Kalka and arranged his marriage

Demetrius without Sunshine
Demetrius with Sunshine as Vitamin D
So we honor Demeter by soaking up sunshine as we worship Calcifer. Those who can’t take Vitamin D instead.

Kalka the bastard married Lady Histidina the Alchemist, binder of metals and they bore Signum the Mamzer, Lady of Metalloproteins

Lady Signum the Mamzer searched far and wide for a good man

She found the sweetest man around. Gluchrome the sweet

Gluchrome was the son of Sucra Elah of Sucrose and Chromius the beautiful

He was very sweet and full of energy

Signum and Gluchrome bore Signum Minor

Vanadius and Bromina married and bore Bromoperoxidus, Bromos for short

Through Bromos we have bromine in our lives

Pope Asparagon married Petronilla daughter of Mangonos and Zinca and they bore Zingana the ornate one


The great Tiara of Zingana, worn by countless hierophants for protection and devotion
Glutama married Glyconai and they bore Corrina

Corrina married Diablos son of Cobalton and Nichaela

Diablos bore Corrina Vita goddess of the B Vitamins

Everyone needs her









The Many forms of Vita
Molybdenus saw the power of Azoth was dwindling in life. And so he planned to bring it back without lightning

Molybdenus married Ferredoxa daughter of Sixtus the Hanged man and Farah the sacrifice

Ferredoxa Lady of Iron-Sulfur Proteins

They bore Femoco the most important protein, tamer of chaos


Femoco
Femoco married Explosia daughter of Ammon and Nox

An achievement only a man of his fortitude could achieve

Explosia bore Femoco Nitrogenus the fertilizer of men

Femoco and Nitrogenus singlehandedly supplied Nitrogen to life for 4 billion years until the great hero Fritz Haber was born


The Hero Haber
Iodina the kind was kind but passionate. She married the calm Celeste and they bore together a son named Thyrus

Thyrus was the lord of the Thyroid. His two mothers were both necessary for raising him, so we need both Iodine and Selenium in our diets.

If you eat too much Iodine and not enough Selenium your thyroid burns up

If you don’t eat enough Iodine your thyroid won’t function

Either way your throat will swell up and you will gain weight


The fate of those deficient in Iodine
Thyrus married Gaiadora daughter of Terra and Inachus and they bore Baba Terra

Lord Carotenus son of Bucky was so tanned he was orange and his eyesight was amazing.

All the women loved him for his tanned skin

To this day many men pray to Lord Carotenus to attract women, they tan their skin to reach his blessing.







Many Devotees of Lord Carotenus each worshipping in their own way
Lord Carotenus gives us Vitamin A and Beta Carotene

Lady Demeter saw the great tanned Lord Carotenus with awe

Lady Demeter was so infatuated she married Carotenus at first sight

Lord Carotenus and Lady Demeter bore Lord Lipid

Lord Lipid rules over the fat soluble vitamins: A, D, E, F, K

Baba Terra married Lord Lipid and they begat Farbina

Methuselah married Signum Minor and they bore Abraham the great father

Bromos and Zinca married and bore Perox who married Vita

Perox and Vita bore Sarah

Abraham married Sarah and they bore Lucas the Allfather

Nitrogenus married Farbina daughter of Lord Lipid and Lady Baba and they bore Freyja the Allmother

Lucas and Freyja married

And so they became the ancestors of all life

They would constantly fight for territory but whenever one claimed territory the whole system would often collapse, they reached a stalemate in their trademark disputes.


The Genetic Code as it stands in the modern day
So Methionon tried again with his second son Eugene

He made a few errors in writing his sacred script, but worked dilligently to avoid them.

Methionon invented DNA repair so his son would survive

And so Eugene and Dana were born from DNA not RNA

And so Methionon proclaimed the central dogma of life:

All scripture shall first be written in DNA. Written in scrolls of Phosphate and Ribose but no Alcohols. Written with the four runes Uracil for Adonai, Adenine for Mithra, Guanine for Azoth, and Cytosine for Hausa

Uracil shall always be methylated to represent order and the union of Adonai and Mithra. It shall be known as Thymine while Methylated.

The great scrolls of DNA shall be carefully protected and repaired by enzymatic robots

As needed we shall write temporary notes on the margins of our scrolls, by methylating our Cytosines and Adenines, but never our Guanines

We shall also write notes in the margins with Histone markers

We shall dilligently copy our sacred scrolls of DNA so future generations can preserve our knowledge

Scribes shall copy our DNA to RNA for simple communications and messages.

Some RNA will be folded with Origami into Ribosomes, but most shall be written as letters to Ribosomes

We shall remove introns from messages we send and then Ribosomes shall receive them

In the Ribosomes our workers shall tirelessly translate our messages into polypeptides, each of the 64 inscriptions shall be given to its owner among the brethren of Methionon

And the polypeptides shall be folded and processed into proteins, the bulwark of all our traditions. We make all our enzymatic robots from proteins.

So this is the Central Dogma of Life. Follow it and your nation shall prosper.

Dana was married to Dagon while Eugene married Nakapta daughter of Kaltus and Salta

Nakapta was a homemaker. She lived in Eugene’s home and worked hard to pump out sodium and in potassium

Eugene wanted to send a great message to his children. He methylated other Runes to send this message

He methylated a sequence of ACG breaking the laws of Methionon

And so Methuselah son of Eugene inherited ACA

Alas ACG and ACA both summoned Theoreticon, so the incantation was saved

Tis the order of things that the trademarks be distributed redundantly

So when we fail our ancestors their message is preserved

Cholesteron son of Lipa was a great Lipid, he fortified many houses and many phospholipids

Cholesteron saw the great solar goddess Amaterasu and he fell in love. Every noon he went to her and asked her hand in marriage

On the 42nd year Amaterasu descended from the sky and married him

Together they begat Demeter: Goddess of Vitamin D

Calcifer met Demeter and chose her as his squire

Calcifer married Zinca

But Plebby seduced him

so was born Kalka the Bastard

This is why we get lead poisoning

The curse of Plebby

Curse to the Plebians


An educational video explaining the curse of Plebby
Nonetheless Lady Demeter the loyal squiress of Calcifer and daughter of Amaterasu still served Kalka and arranged his marriage

Demetrius without Sunshine
Demetrius with Sunshine as Vitamin D
So we honor Demeter by soaking up sunshine as we worship Calcifer. Those who can’t take Vitamin D instead.

Kalka the bastard married Lady Histidina the Alchemist, binder of metals and they bore Signum the Mamzer, Lady of Metalloproteins

Lady Signum the Mamzer searched far and wide for a good man

She found the sweetest man around. Gluchrome the sweet

Gluchrome was the son of Sucra Elah of Sucrose and Chromius the beautiful

He was very sweet and full of energy

Signum and Gluchrome bore Signum Minor

Vanadius and Bromina married and bore Bromoperoxidus, Bromos for short

Through Bromos we have bromine in our lives

Pope Asparagon married Petronilla daughter of Mangonos and Zinca and they bore Zingana the ornate one


The great Tiara of Zingana, worn by countless hierophants for protection and devotion
Glutama married Glyconai and they bore Corrina

Corrina married Diablos son of Cobalton and Nichaela

Diablos bore Corrina Vita goddess of the B Vitamins

Everyone needs her









The Many forms of Vita
Molybdenus saw the power of Azoth was dwindling in life. And so he planned to bring it back without lightning

Molybdenus married Ferredoxa daughter of Sixtus the Hanged man and Farah the sacrifice

Ferredoxa Lady of Iron-Sulfur Proteins

They bore Femoco the most important protein, tamer of chaos


Femoco
Femoco married Explosia daughter of Ammon and Nox

An achievement only a man of his fortitude could achieve

Explosia bore Femoco Nitrogenus the fertilizer of men

Femoco and Nitrogenus singlehandedly supplied Nitrogen to life for 4 billion years until the great hero Fritz Haber was born


The Hero Haber
Iodina the kind was kind but passionate. She married the calm Celeste and they bore together a son named Thyrus

Thyrus was the lord of the Thyroid. His two mothers were both necessary for raising him, so we need both Iodine and Selenium in our diets.

If you eat too much Iodine and not enough Selenium your thyroid burns up

If you don’t eat enough Iodine your thyroid won’t function

Either way your throat will swell up and you will gain weight


The fate of those deficient in Iodine
Thyrus married Gaiadora daughter of Terra and Inachus and they bore Baba Terra

Lord Carotenus son of Bucky was so tanned he was orange and his eyesight was amazing.

All the women loved him for his tanned skin

To this day many men pray to Lord Carotenus to attract women, they tan their skin to reach his blessing.







Many Devotees of Lord Carotenus each worshipping in their own way
Lord Carotenus gives us Vitamin A and Beta Carotene

Lady Demeter saw the great tanned Lord Carotenus with awe

Lady Demeter was so infatuated she married Carotenus at first sight

Lord Carotenus and Lady Demeter bore Lord Lipid

Lord Lipid rules over the fat soluble vitamins: A, D, E, F, K

Baba Terra married Lord Lipid and they begat Farbina

Methuselah married Signum Minor and they bore Abraham the great father

Bromos and Zinca married and bore Perox who married Vita

Perox and Vita bore Sarah

Abraham married Sarah and they bore Lucas the Allfather

Nitrogenus married Farbina daughter of Lord Lipid and Lady Baba and they bore Freyja the Allmother

Lucas and Freyja married

And so they became the ancestors of all life

He led his siblings to build great structures known as proteins. Gigantic machines greater than anything the world has ever seen.

He built great factories called Ribosomes from origami of scrolls and started building every protein himself. At the end of each protein came Persephone the Maiden of Death and ends.

Great runic machines that make proteins and peptides

Methionon cared greatly for his family’s future. He knew that alcohol could compromise his family’s future so he wrote his sacred scrolls without alcohol.

He wrote his script with Deoxyribose so it had no alcohols on the side and it didn’t react, it was resilient and good for storing information



RNA on the left, note the alcohol groups labeled as OH, DNA is on the right note the lack of alcohol groups source
Methionon saw that his script was erroneous so he changed it.

Methionon added a dot to his U’s to make them easier to read.






Traditional Hebrew Methylated letters honoring Methionon
And Methionon methylated many more runes

Some A’s G’s and even C’s

In fancy calligraphy he passed onto his son a fully methylated UGG. But alas dotted G looked too much like A.

Methionon’s first son Esperon died from his magic scroll saying UAA instead of UGG. Instead of invoking Tryptophanes he invoked Persephone the maiden of death, and so he died from a nonsense mutation.

And so this is why we never methylate G’s.

We keep Uracil methylated for protection but avoid excesses



Methylated Uracil, known as Thymine to some
And occasionally Methylate our A’s and C’s

G’s with methyls and U’s without methyls are the signs of a civilization disconnected from tradition. Cancer, a society lost in hedonism.

Methionon decided there must be order in the code. So he offered each of his siblings trademarks in the code.

He wrote 64 inscriptions in his Scroll and the Elohim scrambled for them

He took for himself AUG the great start codon. Mithra-Adonai-Azoth

The great potential of the Sun, bound by Mitra-Varuna on either side

Each aggressively fought for their words and patented them and all adjacent.

First Phanella took UUU, Prolina CCC, Lyson AAA, and Glycon GGG

Leucina, Serena, and Arginina were powerful and claimed multiple spots

Leucina under Adonai and Hausa

Serena under Adonai and Mithra

Arginina under Hausa and Mithra

Under Adonai fell Tyrroson, Persephone in Amber and Ochre, Sixtus, Celeste, and Tryptophanes

Under Hausa fell Histidina and Glutamina

Under Mithra fell Isis and Methionon and Theoreticon and Asparagon

Under Azoth fell Valerian and Alanon and Asparticus and Glutamicus

They would constantly fight for territory but whenever one claimed territory the whole system would often collapse, they reached a stalemate in their trademark disputes.

He methylated a sequence of ACG breaking the laws of Methionon

And so Methuselah son of Eugene inherited ACA

Alas ACG and ACA both summoned Theoreticon, so the incantation was saved

Tis the order of things that the trademarks be distributed redundantly

So when we fail our ancestors their message is preserved

Cholesteron son of Lipa was a great Lipid, he fortified many houses and many phospholipids

Cholesteron saw the great solar goddess Amaterasu and he fell in love. Every noon he went to her and asked her hand in marriage

On the 42nd year Amaterasu descended from the sky and married him

Together they begat Demeter: Goddess of Vitamin D

Calcifer met Demeter and chose her as his squire

Calcifer married Zinca

But Plebby seduced him

so was born Kalka the Bastard

This is why we get lead poisoning

The curse of Plebby

Curse to the Plebians


An educational video explaining the curse of Plebby
Nonetheless Lady Demeter the loyal squiress of Calcifer and daughter of Amaterasu still served Kalka and arranged his marriage

Demetrius without Sunshine
Demetrius with Sunshine as Vitamin D
So we honor Demeter by soaking up sunshine as we worship Calcifer. Those who can’t take Vitamin D instead.

Kalka the bastard married Lady Histidina the Alchemist, binder of metals and they bore Signum the Mamzer, Lady of Metalloproteins

Lady Signum the Mamzer searched far and wide for a good man

She found the sweetest man around. Gluchrome the sweet

Gluchrome was the son of Sucra Elah of Sucrose and Chromius the beautiful

He was very sweet and full of energy

Signum and Gluchrome bore Signum Minor

Vanadius and Bromina married and bore Bromoperoxidus, Bromos for short

Through Bromos we have bromine in our lives

Pope Asparagon married Petronilla daughter of Mangonos and Zinca and they bore Zingana the ornate one


The great Tiara of Zingana, worn by countless hierophants for protection and devotion
Glutama married Glyconai and they bore Corrina

Corrina married Diablos son of Cobalton and Nichaela

Diablos bore Corrina Vita goddess of the B Vitamins

Everyone needs her









The Many forms of Vita
Molybdenus saw the power of Azoth was dwindling in life. And so he planned to bring it back without lightning

Molybdenus married Ferredoxa daughter of Sixtus the Hanged man and Farah the sacrifice

Ferredoxa Lady of Iron-Sulfur Proteins

They bore Femoco the most important protein, tamer of chaos


Femoco
Femoco married Explosia daughter of Ammon and Nox

An achievement only a man of his fortitude could achieve

Explosia bore Femoco Nitrogenus the fertilizer of men

Femoco and Nitrogenus singlehandedly supplied Nitrogen to life for 4 billion years until the great hero Fritz Haber was born


The Hero Haber
Iodina the kind was kind but passionate. She married the calm Celeste and they bore together a son named Thyrus

Thyrus was the lord of the Thyroid. His two mothers were both necessary for raising him, so we need both Iodine and Selenium in our diets.

If you eat too much Iodine and not enough Selenium your thyroid burns up

If you don’t eat enough Iodine your thyroid won’t function

Either way your throat will swell up and you will gain weight


The fate of those deficient in Iodine
Thyrus married Gaiadora daughter of Terra and Inachus and they bore Baba Terra

Lord Carotenus son of Bucky was so tanned he was orange and his eyesight was amazing.

All the women loved him for his tanned skin

To this day many men pray to Lord Carotenus to attract women, they tan their skin to reach his blessing.







Many Devotees of Lord Carotenus each worshipping in their own way
Lord Carotenus gives us Vitamin A and Beta Carotene

Lady Demeter saw the great tanned Lord Carotenus with awe

Lady Demeter was so infatuated she married Carotenus at first sight

Lord Carotenus and Lady Demeter bore Lord Lipid

Lord Lipid rules over the fat soluble vitamins: A, D, E, F, K

Baba Terra married Lord Lipid and they begat Farbina

Methuselah married Signum Minor and they bore Abraham the great father

Bromos and Zinca married and bore Perox who married Vita

Perox and Vita bore Sarah

Abraham married Sarah and they bore Lucas the Allfather

Nitrogenus married Farbina daughter of Lord Lipid and Lady Baba and they bore Freyja the Allmother

Lucas and Freyja married

And so they became the ancestors of all life

== Flaws ==
Being unfinished one cannot make as much of a critique of the Old Gaiad as one could with the [[New Gaiad]]

Opening is hard to follow, goes too hard on genealogy to the expense of themes. 

Sources of things were a bit too eclectic and plot points were lost. 

Sutras tended to be overly genealogical without interesting myths. 

Many things were set up but didn't end up ever happening. The reason for this is that the task was too long and arduous to get from the opening to the point where a lot of set up things started to have impact

For this reason I dislike certain elements of the Old Gaiad. For instance the usage of the name [[Shiva]] was for the god of genetic engineering, in reference to the [[Twin Nuclei Problem]] of [[Eric Weinstein]], as a complement to [[Adonai]] which represented the atomic nucleus. But both deities showed up billions of years (and dozens of sutras) before their usefulness. This can at times give an impression of [[cultural appropriation]] which was really just the product of the incompleteness of the text. The current Gaiad is written at a faster pace and is currently at Sutra 13.

Janusicthus begat Kondricthus and Osticthus

As they lived their waters grew suffocating and toxic

One day they prayed to Elohim for a solution with an offering of 100 trilobites

And Elohim said unto them “I shall grant one of you sight to see the stars, and the other I shall grant a nose to smell all the chemicals of life”

Chondricthus said “I as the eldest son shall take the nose so I shall outhunt the placoderms and conquer the seas”

And so he was granted a nose of a thousand scents

Osticthus received from Elohim a ring of bone around each eye to hold the lens and a new cell: cone cells that could detect colors



And so the sons of Osticthus would come to rule by sight and the sons of Kondricthus by smell


Icthyosaur eye rings
Kondricthus smelled sweeter waters away, while Osticthus saw the clean air of heaven and the sons of Arthropus there

Acanthus son of Kondricthus challenged the reign of the Placoderms

He built a skeleton not of bone but of cartilage, and his wife laid but a few eggs they deeply cared for


Acanthus
Osticthus swam up the Elivagar River, called the Mississippi and New River today


Osticthus breathed air through his spiracles, as he opened his cheeks

And then he pushed it down, down his throat


And so his spiracles came to be for air not water


Osticthus
Us sons of Osticthus come together to sing the hymn of Elivagar and celebrate our unity

Almost heaven, West Virginia

Blue Ridge Mountains, Elivagar River

Life is old there, older than the trees

Older than the mountains, growin’ live a breeze

Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain mama

Take me home, country roads

All my memories gather ’round her

Miner’s lady, stranger to blue water

Dark and dusty, painted on the sky

Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain mama

Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the mornin’ hour, she calls me

The radio reminds me of my home far away

Drivin’ down the road, I get a feelin’

That I should’ve been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain mama

Take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain mama

Take me home, country roads

Take me home, down country roads

Take me home, down country roads

Osticthus married Eutelea and together they bore two sons: Actinus and Sacropter

Sarcopter saw potential in the forests of Elivagar, he swam through the forests, and built strong bony lobed fins to push himself through the trees

While Actinus saw with the air of heaven in his belly he could fly underwater. His lung became a swim bladder and he went onto conquer the Baltic Sea. He built ray fins that helped him fly and married Andrea Lepis who laid 900 eggs


The fins of Sacropter and Actinus
And so the sons of Osticthus: Actinus and Sacropter, and Acanthus son of Chondricthus became the fathers of the three great vertebrate houses</text>

Janusicthus begat Kondricthus and Osticthus
[[Category:Old Gaiad]]
As they lived their waters grew suffocating and toxic

One day they prayed to Elohim for a solution with an offering of 100 trilobites

And Elohim said unto them “I shall grant one of you sight to see the stars, and the other I shall grant a nose to smell all the chemicals of life”

Chondricthus said “I as the eldest son shall take the nose so I shall outhunt the placoderms and conquer the seas”

And so he was granted a nose of a thousand scents

Osticthus received from Elohim a ring of bone around each eye to hold the lens and a new cell: cone cells that could detect colors



And so the sons of Osticthus would come to rule by sight and the sons of Kondricthus by smell


Icthyosaur eye rings
Kondricthus smelled sweeter waters away, while Osticthus saw the clean air of heaven and the sons of Arthropus there

Acanthus son of Kondricthus challenged the reign of the Placoderms

He built a skeleton not of bone but of cartilage, and his wife laid but a few eggs they deeply cared for


Acanthus
Osticthus swam up the Elivagar River, called the Mississippi and New River today


Osticthus breathed air through his spiracles, as he opened his cheeks

And then he pushed it down, down his throat


And so his spiracles came to be for air not water


Osticthus
Us sons of Osticthus come together to sing the hymn of Elivagar and celebrate our unity

Almost heaven, West Virginia

Blue Ridge Mountains, Elivagar River

Life is old there, older than the trees

Older than the mountains, growin’ live a breeze

Arboreus split the world between two sons: Lycos and Ginkgon

Lycos released countless spores and by those spores he bore two sons: Isolagos and Lycopodion


Lycopodion became the ancestor of the clubmosses, he built a city so giant it became known as the first tree, a scale tree

Lycopodion
Today his spores are known as Lycopodium powder and used for the power of fire


Isolagos split his spores male and female and raised his sons and daughters in his own city

Isolagos bore two sons: Quill and Sellagine

Quill
Sellagine
The sons of Sellagine creeped their leaves across the ground, in dry times they died and in wet times they revived


Sellagine reviving
The sons of Quill became known as the Quillworts, they grew their microphylls tall into the sky, with no stomata they absorbed air through the ground, grew their stems underground, their spores underwater


Gingkon branched his leaves two by two, and so his leaves were megaphyllic

And he bore a son named Phyllon

Gingkon
Phyllon
Phyllon begat Pteridos and Gymnos

Pteridos begat Horsa and Euspor

Horsa begat Equis

As a gametophyte the spawn of Equis swam to find their brige

And they found Puzella

And grew roots from there

Equis reduced his veins to one like Lycos and became ancestor of the puzzlegrass

He built armor of silicon to protect his city from all dangers

He spilt ink on his scriptures, and so was lost the megaphylls of times past, his leaves were one vein and one vein only, like Lycos before him

In summer he built puzzlegrass to store nutrients for the winter, and when winter passed he used those nutrients to build horsetails

In spring as the snow melted he built horsetails, with no chlorophyll, only spores and lots of them, his spores spread wide across all nations

In summer he demolished his horsetails, and he built puzzlegrass

And his sons and daughters from the horsetails built puzzlegrass too

And so the sons of Equis and the daughters of Puzella came to rule all across the world

Horsetails
Puzzlegrass
Euspor begat Adderos and Fernando

Adderos begat Ophios and Psilos

Ophios became ancestor of the adders-tongues, he built but one giant leaf

and Psilos of the whisk ferns for he built no leaves at all

Ophios
Psilos
Fernando uncoiled a great frond of leaves


Maratton begat Maratidus and Leptos

Marattidus bore ten thousand spores on each leaf while Leptos bore a mere hundred

Together they became the ancestors of the ferns

As the sons of Arboreus settled the lands they built great swamps across the Mississippi River, and it was here where our ancestors, the sons of Osticthus would climb onto land</text>

As the sons of Devon were growing the spineless sons of Proteus were growing in their shadow, building themselves up to overthrow the sons of Devon

Among the sons of Spiralius, Neo son in the tenth generation of Bactridius was the smartest soul on Terra

Alas what he bore in intelligence he lacked in wisdom, he rejected his ancestors and refused to learn from their mistakes. And do he and his children were cursed to always reinvent the wheel and repeat his mistakes

Neo bore two sons: Ammon and Coleos and both reinvented the wheel too

Ammon
Coleos
Coleos wrapped his shell in his mantle and through that his shell grew stronger

Ammon grew a coiled compact shell and swam wherever he wished.

Among the sons of Ectus, Malacus begat Caridus and Phyllos and Hoplos

Phyllos
Hoplos
Caridus begat Syn Peras and Yuval

Peras bore Amphipus and Isopus and many other children, his wife Possa carried them in her pouch and nourished them as they grew

Amphipus
Isopus
Yuval bore two sons: Decapus and Krillon

Krillon stayed small and spent his life swimming, while Decapus grew large and sank to the seafloor

Decapus
Krillon
And so crustaceans would be dominated by the three great houses: Amphipods, Isopods, and Decapods, sons of the three great cladoplasts: Amphipus, Isopus, and Decapus

Decapus begat Pleos and Prawnmegas

Prawnmegas became ancestor of the prawns


An unfortunate son of Prawnmegas
Pleos begat Repton and Shrimpon

Shrimpon became the father of the shrimp, boxers and all

Repton begat Thalasson and Omar

Omar became father of the lobsters and crayfish


Omar
Thalasson became the father of the mud shrimp

The mud shrimp built great channels in stone, to this day we honor their fossilized ruins, the great cities of Thallasintep and beyond


Mud shrimp lairs fossilized in a human sculpture
Meiuron son in the tenth generation of Thalasson rejected the ways of his father

And so he went to live on the surface

Meiuron bore two sons: Anomuron and Saraton

Anomuron
Saraton
Saraton was an agile yet vain

And so he constantly promoted his body as the best


Propaganda from Saraton
The sons of Anomuron would live quietly as squat lobsters, this would change in ten generations

Paguros was a son of Anomuron with a weak soft shell

In his dying breath the Ammonite Menses gave Paguros his shell

And so Paguros became the father of the hermit crabs


Paguros
Alas the Protean rebellion failed, and the sons of Devon continued to rule the seas

But a new frontier was opening on land, the frontier of the forests, and there the sons of Proteus would find new domains</text>

Isopus
Yuval bore two sons: Decapus and Krillon

Krillon stayed small and spent his life swimming, while Decapus grew large and sank to the seafloor

Decapus
Krillon
And so crustaceans would be dominated by the three great houses: Amphipods, Isopods, and Decapods, sons of the three great cladoplasts: Amphipus, Isopus, and Decapus

Decapus begat Pleos and Prawnmegas

Prawnmegas became ancestor of the prawns


An unfortunate son of Prawnmegas
Pleos begat Repton and Shrimpon

Shrimpon became the father of the shrimp, boxers and all

Repton begat Thalasson and Omar

Omar became father of the lobsters and crayfish


Omar
Thalasson became the father of the mud shrimp

The mud shrimp built great channels in stone, to this day we honor their fossilized ruins, the great cities of Thallasintep and beyond


Mud shrimp lairs fossilized in a human sculpture
Meiuron son in the tenth generation of Thalasson rejected the ways of his father

And so he went to live on the surface

Meiuron bore two sons: Anomuron and Saraton

Anomuron
Saraton
Saraton was an agile yet vain

And so he constantly promoted his body as the best


Propaganda from Saraton
The sons of Anomuron would live quietly as squat lobsters, this would change in ten generations

Paguros was a son of Anomuron with a weak soft shell

In his dying breath the Ammonite Menses gave Paguros his shell

And so Paguros became the father of the hermit crabs


Paguros
Alas the Protean rebellion failed, and the sons of Devon continued to rule the seas

But a new frontier was opening on land, the frontier of the forests, and there the sons of Proteus would find new domains</text>

As he sat on the ground he sucked water into his first gill, notched between jaws and skull

Through his spiracle his mouth filled with water, and the rich oxygen built for millenia by daughters of Saya


Through his gills the hematic maidens carried oxygen to all his subjects

And to the brain they went through the spiracle, bringing more to his eyes and brain

In opposition and countercurrent, the blood took all the oxygen

When Devon moved he opened his mouth and the water passed freely over and through

When he found food he cleaved it by his jawbone


And behind his teeth followed and chewed

Down in the stomach acid purified

Pancreas and gallbladder mixed in

And intestine spiralling innumerably

Nutrition entered his veins

His portal vein

Fats and Sugars, Proteins and Phosphorus, Metals and Vitamins

And his liver purified his blood

The kidneys emptied in

And out the cloaca


Devon’s Spiral valve, lost in Teleosts
When he married his wife he released his sperm

Out the cloaca and to her eggs

Two of the million were Llŷr and Stennisio


Stennisio
The sons of Stennisio lived across the seafloor eating clams

Llŷr begat Bran

Bran begat Caradoc

Caradoc begat Cynan and Acantho and Sudopedal

Sudopetal
Daughters of Acantho
Cynan begat Cadwr

Cadwr bergat Eudaf

Eudaf begat Morfawr

Morfawr begat Tudwal

Tudwal begat Cynfawr and Rhineheart

Rhineheart lived on the Rhine, flattened and invisible, like a ray before rays


sons of Rhineheart
Cynfawr begat Custennin and Antiarchon

Antiarchon rebelled against his ancestors for he stood against Archons, an Anarchist

He lived under the soils and waited for prey

The sons of Antiarchon would form great bands of guerillas haunting the sons of Animus

Antiarchon
Custennin embarked on a great journey to find a homeland

He searched far and wide and settled in China

Custennin begat Uther and Petallon

Petallon
Uther begat Arthur and Maxil

Arthur bore a son and daughter: Arthur the Younger, and Ptycho the maiden

The daughters of Ptycho were numerous, among them Mary the Mother of Icthys who bore a placenta millions of years before anyone else


Mary mother of Icthys
The sons of Arthur the younger became known as the Arthrodires

Arthur the Younger bore three sons: Mordred, Wuttago, and Actino

Wuttago
Actino
Mordred turned on his father and bore two sons: Philip and Melehan


Philip
Melehan begat Brachy and Phlyctae

And the sons of Brachy ruled the world, overthrowing the sons of Silur from times past

Brachy begat Eubar and Buchan and Homosteus

Buchan
Homosteus
Eubar begat Pachos and Coccos

Pachos begat Dunkella and Aspino

Dunkella grew greatest yet among the sons of Metazo, 6 meters in length, or three Jaekelopterii, less than Cameroceras but with a thousand times his men

The sons and daughters of Pachos grew great and powerful and ruled the entire world in this age


Dunkella a daughter of Arthur
Maxil brother of Arthur begat Qilinyu


Qilinyu
Qilinyu begat Entelognathus whose jaw was complete


Entelognathus
Entelognathus begat Janusicthus

Janusicthus brought his teeth from gills to jawbone.


And so his jaw crushed down with teeth not bone


Janusicthus
And brought his skull inside

Sensing the nerves of all others

He became the ancestor of the fish and the beasts</text>

For eleven generations her line alternated climbing to Polysporos. She lived in her mother’s womb like her brothers and sisters but she yearned to live like her mother, strong and independent.

Daughter of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon daughter of two great rulers yet forced to live her life only to have children for she was sporophyte and they were gametophytes

Polycomb read in her mother’s library to learn why she was given such a meager existence.

Polycomb read the countless sagas of her mothers and fathers

She read of the scrolls of Mardoll and Shiva, and saw that the order of gametophyte and sporophyte was far from eternal as her mother said


Gam3etophytes at the bottom and Spermatophytes at the top in traditional moss
She saw a scroll labelled PRC2 and she read it with intrigue

Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 she saw the scriptures her mother used to repress her

And so Polycomb burned the scriptures PRC2 would be no more, and took all her mothers lands and cities for herself

And so she broke the barrier. She grew spores and calyptra and stoma like her sisters sporophytes, and rhizoids like her

And so through her rhizoids water rose from the earth and through her stoma left into the heavens

This was how her life transpired ad she rose to heaven

She prayed to Lord Tryptophanes lord of life lord of the sun so she could grow to great heights

And so Lord Tryptophanes blest her with Auxin and she grew to the sun, when the sun struck auxin decayed, and in shade it grew in numbers, and so her stems grew towards the light


Auxin

A daughter of Polycomb growing to the light by the guidance of Auxin
Polycomb bore a daughter named Knoxy

Knoxy married Xylon and together they took after Polycomb

Knoxy searched the scriptures and found a scroll named KNOX2

KNOTTED-like TALE homeobox gene class II the gene that kept her from stoma like her mother

And so Knoxy and Xylon built a great kingdom stretching to the heavens like that of Polycomb

But the kingdom’s roads were clogged, water struggled to reach the heavens, and so Xylon designated a clan of subjects as Xylem, Tracheids, carriers of water from Root to Leaf

Xylon and Knoxy bore a son they named Pholon


Pholon
Pholon saw that his roots were starving, and his Mycorrhizae unionized and demanded ten times the sucrose for their labor

So Pholon built channels in his city like Xylem but carrying food not water

He called these channels Phloem

In the leaves sugar was pumped into the phloem

And the concentration gradient sucked water from the xylem to the sugar in the water, and pressure pumped away from the source

In the roots sugar was pumped out of the phloem, and with that the water pumped out into the xylem again


And by this the roots earned their fair share, and the faithful sons of Glomeros too

And so by the wood wide web Pholon’s empire expanded

Through his faithful Mycorrhizae he provided for his sons

Pholon became known as cookson for he provided food to all and brought great prosperity to the lands

His sons lived underground living off the wood-wide web rather than photosynthesis, they grew lazy in prosperity. And this is how the roles of sporophyte and gametophyte swapped


Cookson bore a grandson named Tracheus, and by Tracheus the tracheophytes were born


Tracheus built leaves, microphylls with a vein into them to act as solar panels in his green energy plan. He built his city greater than even Pholon


He designated a clan in his city as Collenchyma, thick flexible support structures to keep his city together

And the clan of Sclerenchyma: hard and full of lignin the sclerenchyma became wood


Tracheus’ city structure
Soon the sons of Tracheus would come to rule the lands. The Devonian was beginning.</text>

From Laurentia to Siberia, from Baltica to Avalonia, even to frigid Gondwana the sons of Stomatos grew numbers upon numbers

To each son there was a falling star and a wish for a thousand grandsons


The sons of Stomatos
The sons of Stomatos built bodies of Carbon and mausoleums of coal. Taking Carbon but leaving dioxide.

And so Terra’s cloak was shed, and she grew cold. She grew frigid and unwelcoming. Her ice caps grew and her seas retracted.

Soon Gondwana became nothing but ice

But to the sons of Stomatos this meant more land

King Hirnan the great united the sons of Stomatos

Hirnan lived in the land of Avalonia, and the province of Holland

Hirnan built a billion levies and dykes, he built so many cities and destroyed the habitats in the seas

And so countless trilobites died, their lands conquered by the sons of Hirnan

In their last effort a million trilobites invaded and smashed through the dykes of Hirnan

But alas all trilobites suffocated, no trilobites would ever reach land

Hirnan bore two sons: Moses and Osiris

Moses became the father of the mosses

Orisis bore two sons: Polysporos and Anthoceros

Anthoceros became the father of the hornworts

Polysporos became the father of ferns and flowers and trees

The sons of Brachios struggled, the sons of Lingulus died in greater numbers than ever before, never again would they regain their glory

But as the tyranny if Hirnan continued the sons of Metazo regrew


Alas the sons of Hirnan didn’t stop there

The Glomerings mined the rocks of Terra for fertilizer, and they manufactured tonnes of phosphorus fertilizer

Some went to crops, but most went to rivers

In the rivers grew thick scum and in the oceans the sun was blotted out


Rotting seaweed choked out all water, soon it was impossible to breathe and the seas turned lifeless



The entire ocean under the tyranny of Hirnan
The great houses of Leviathan and Kraken were wiped off the face of the earth

Among the trilobites the great houses of Agnos, Ptychos were destroyed and Asaphos crippled forever. Never again would they reach the glory of the Ordovician

And so the golden age was finally over. The Ordovician ended. The sons of Silur would come to conquer the ashes and bring about the Silurian</text>

Ellesmer begat Endos and Actinos

Endos bore many sons who moved slowly across the sea. Greatest among them was Cameroceras Magnus, known to history as Cameromagne. Cameromagne overthrew the sons of Leviathan.

Endoceras son of Cameromagne grew nine thousand milimeters long. 20 cubits front to end. He dwarfed Leviathan fourfold.

Bivos who fished out of his two shells shed his radula


Bivos
And so he took upon himself a new form


Modern anatomy of a son of Bivos
Bivos bore a son and a daughter: Peter and Aphrodite

Aphrodite became the ancestress of the Oysters

Peter bore many sons who became known as Trigonians

There was a great massacre of the sons of Peter

Among his sons there was Unus who escaped and became the ancestor of the river mussells

Keeper of the Pearly Gates, Peter defends us

From the river mussells come the river Pearls


His sons live on the fishes, as lice in childhood and on the rocks as pearlbearers in elderhood


Aphrodite became the Mother of Pearls and the Mother of Oysters


Pearl structure

Among her countless daughters Aphrodite bore three unique sons: Scallon, Spinos, and Pyros

Scallops Spiny Oysters and Flame Scallops

Scallon
Spinos
Pyros
Scallon had a million eyes


Inside the Scallop
Scallon was great and bountiful, and he swam free from the dangers that haunted him



Clammon was the son of Bivos
Clammon begat Cockle and Myidus and Adapa and Venus
Cockle had a son who was the ancestor of the giant clams

Cockle

Myidus bore three sons Zebra, Softshell, and Teredo the sea termite

Zebra Mussells

Adapa begat Geodoros ancestor of the Geoducks, and Razoron ancestor of the Razor Shells

Geoduck
Razor Shell
Venus became ancrestress of the Venus clams


Among her children she bore a daughter Corbiculacea ancestress of the freshwater clams


Brachios begat three sons for the three houses of the Brachiopods
Lingulus the tailed was the archconservative in the house of Brachios
Lingulus son of Lingulus maintained the tradition to its fullest
Discinidus son of Lingulus was smaller and more clammy


Lingulus the serpentine
Calciatus begat Craniidus and Articulus

Craniidus had no tail

Articulus was cheap in the building of his children. He built them without anuses, as blobs that couldn’t swim that metamorphosed in an instant.

The sons of Articulus were numerous beyond number, a formidable force against the sons of Bivos


A son of Articulatus
But as the Bivalves and the Brachiopods fought their war a new threat emerged. A threat greater than any could imagine before</text>

The ancient house of the Brachiopods found themselves beset on all sides by the rising Bivalves


Bivos who fished out of his two shells shed his radula


Bivos
And so he took upon himself a new form


Modern anatomy of a son of Bivos[[Category:Old Gaiad]]
Bivos bore a son and a daughter: Peter and Aphrodite

Aphrodite became the ancestress of the Oysters[[Category:Pre-Outage Pages]]

Peter bore many sons who became known as Trigonians

There was a great massacre of the sons of Peter

Among his sons there was Unus who escaped and became the ancestor of the river mussells

Keeper of the Pearly Gates, Peter defends us

From the river mussells come the river Pearls


His sons live on the fishes, as lice in childhood and on the rocks as pearlbearers in elderhood


Aphrodite became the Mother of Pearls and the Mother of Oysters


Pearl structure

Among her countless daughters Aphrodite bore three unique sons: Scallon, Spinos, and Pyros

Scallops Spiny Oysters and Flame Scallops

Scallon
Spinos
Pyros
Scallon had a million eyes


Inside the Scallop
Scallon was great and bountiful, and he swam free from the dangers that haunted him



Clammon was the son of Bivos
Clammon begat Cockle and Myidus and Adapa and Venus
Cockle had a son who was the ancestor of the giant clams

Cockle
Giant Clam

Myidus bore three sons Zebra, Softshell, and Teredo the sea termite

Zebra Mussells
Softshell clam
Adapa begat Geodoros ancestor of the Geoducks, and Razoron ancestor of the Razor Shells

Geoduck
Razor Shell
Venus became ancrestress of the Venus clams


Among her children she bore a daughter Corbiculacea ancestress of the freshwater clams


Brachios begat three sons for the three houses of the Brachiopods
Lingulus the tailed was the archconservative in the house of Brachios
Lingulus son of Lingulus maintained the tradition to its fullest
Discinidus son of Lingulus was smaller and more clammy


Lingulus the serpentine
Calciatus begat Craniidus and Articulus

Craniidus had no tail

Articulus was cheap in the building of his children. He built them without anuses, as blobs that couldn’t swim that metamorphosed in an instant.

The sons of Articulus were numerous beyond number, a formidable force against the sons of Bivos

Gastropus twisted each of his sons so that their anus be next to their heads

And so by this the sons of Gastropus could pull completely within their shell


A greatly coiled son of Gastropus
The sons of Gastropus outnumbered all other classes, in all of history only the Insects would grow greater

The Priests of Gastropus wear regal robes of Tyrian purple to represent the regal mucus of Gastropus and his kingdom. In the year of 8430 the Phoenician Empire conquered the great Gastropod Empire and laid claim to the sacred priestly dye. From them it came to the Romans and to this day when we think of Purple we think of Majesty.


Tyrian Purple Priestly Robes

Tyrian Purple molecule
Just as the majesty of Gastropus was purple, his faith was blue. In the time of Moses Prince Hexaplex would bless him with the great blessing of the tassels. To this day many devotees of Moses and Hexaplex wear tassels blue with faith







Limpus was the firstborn son of Gastropus. His sons became known as the Limpets and his daughters as the Limpettes

The Limpets are the keepers of tradition.

Limpus said to his Myriad children

Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock. The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it didn’t fall, for it was founded on the rock. Everyone who hears these words of mine, and doesn’t do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house on the sand. The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell—and great was its fall.

The Limpets build their houses on rocks, not sand. As the waves bellowed and beat at them the Limpets firmly stand their ground

When a limpet moves they always go home to their rock

As their father before them did the Limpets merge their shells to the rock, growing them as intricate fits to their rocky foundations


A young Limpette holding fast to her traditions
And so we tell the Hymn of Limpus whenever we feel lost. So we may always return home

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Limpus’ blood and righteousness.
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly trust in Limpus’ Name.

Limpus the solid Rock I stand,
All other ground is sinking sand;
All other ground is sinking sand.

Snellon the youngest son of Gastropus stood not for tradition but for innovation. Snellon bore two sons: Vetigas and Escargon

Vetigas bore two sons: Trochus and Avalon

Trochus became the ancestor of the Turban Snails and Trochus snails. Dutiful cleaners of aquaria and ecosystems alike


Trochus
Avalon became the ancestor of the Abalones

The sons of Avalon are great and hardy, with pores in their shells for breathing they look rough on the outside, but have great beauty on the inside





Escargon coiled his shell more and bore two sons whose shells coiled even more: Neritus and Conchus

Neritus became the ancestor of the snails with lids, impenetrable shells that close when they hide


Neritus
Conchus bore two sons: Marius of the Sea, and Heterobran of the Skies

Marius of the Sea became the ancestor of the many little snails across the seas periwinkles, cowries, wentletraps, moon snails, murexes, cone snails, and turrids.

Periwinkle
Moon Snail
Murex
Cone Snail
Violet Float Snail
Turrid
Cowry
Rabbit Snail
Surfing Snails, Assasin Snails, Swimming snails

The surfing snails move at breakneck speed across the shores of the seas. Here is the story of Olivella and Agaronia daughters of Olivius the surfer.


The cone snails are deceptively named, for they really are assassin snails. Otherworldly beauty emanates from them for they live between life and death. With poison so strong nothing can survive



Cowries are great devotees of the goddess Cupria. By her blessing they invented money. And so their shells became the first money



In China their great shells are immortalized in the character for money


The murexes were the hedgehog snails with beautiful colors



The great Conches were beautiful and adorable




Conches
Heterobran of the skies was a swimmer par excellence

Heterobran begat Nudos and Aeros

Nudos shed his shell and untwisted himself. He became ancestor to the nudibranches. Colorful sea slugs with poison to kill Leviathan


Aeros swam in the water free from all care

Aeros bore a son and a daughter: Pulmon and Angelica

Angelica was the ancestress of the sea butterflies: beautiful swimming snails whose ethereal existence eludes most



Pulmon the great revered ancestor did something none else could dream of

He inhaled a breath of fresh air and built for himself a lung, and so he could survive the tide pools like none of his brethren before him</text>

Crustaceus begat Karkon and Mushi

Mushi begat two sons: Copepus and Lepipus

Sons of Lepipus in the modern day
Lepipus the strange
Meanwhile Lepipus begat Brachios and Silvio


A daughter of Silvio
Some day millions of years later the sons of Silvio would become the great insects that ruled the world

Branchios became the ancestor of the Sea Monkeys and the Water Fleas

Sea monkeys in their natural habitat
Water Flea in her natural habitat
Karkon fled to the open waters where he begat Pancer and Cephalocaridus

Pancer begat Oligostracus and Polycruster

Oligostracus bore many sons, among his sons were the seed shrimp and the degenerate tongue worms who live as parasites instead of getting jobs.

Polycruster begat Barnacus and Malacus

Barnacus was a great frontiersman. Barnacus settled down with a stalk on the ground. He lived like a son of Cnider.

Pollicipes cornucopia
Barnacus bore a son he named Goose. Goose was a great and built a great society, but alas no matter how hard he tried he never became a goose


Goose still claimed his sons were the Geese. And so he is the Eloh of the Geese and their sacred guide


Barnacle geese hang from tree, (Miniature) Barnacle geese, as described by Gerald of Wales. They develop from beams in the water and hang from trees enclosed in shells until they can grow feathers and fly. Image taken from Bestiary. Originally published in England (Salisbury?); 1230-1240.
Among the sons of Goose many grew smaller and more compact. They became the Barnacles we know today, half shrimp half coral full animals


Malacus bore many descendants. Among them the crabs and the shrimp and the isopods and the amphipods. They would become a great dynasty among no peers in the future. So great when we speak of the sons of Crustaceus we speak first and foremost of the great sons of Malacus whose dynasty was yet to reach greatness under the yoke of the Trilobites</text>

      <text bytes="2430" sha1="7cbr5sd0uehy7tqe0lp01yfww4mvfg6" xml:space="preserve">While the Trilobites ruled the seas, the rivers were free to their lesser brethren

The sons of Arachnus ruled the seas and the sons of Insectus ruled the rivers

The sons of Cain and Abel ruled the lands

And so Crustaceus saw nowhere to go, yet he tried nonetheless to establish his dynasty
[[Category:Old Gaiad]]
Heaven rewards the determination of Crustaceus to rise above all circumstance

Crustaceus begat Karkon and Mushi

Mushi begat two sons: Copepus and Lepipus[[Category:Pre-Outage Pages]]


Copepus became the ancestor of the copepods, the little ones of the seas. Insects of all forms.

Sons of Lepipus in the modern day
Lepipus the strange
Meanwhile Lepipus begat Brachios and Silvio


A daughter of Silvio
Some day millions of years later the sons of Silvio would become the great insects that ruled the world

Branchios became the ancestor of the Sea Monkeys and the Water Fleas

Sea monkeys in their natural habitat
Water Flea in her natural habitat
Karkon fled to the open waters where he begat Pancer and Cephalocaridus

Pancer begat Oligostracus and Polycruster

Oligostracus bore many sons, among his sons were the seed shrimp and the degenerate tongue worms who live as parasites instead of getting jobs.

Polycruster begat Barnacus and Malacus

Barnacus was a great frontiersman. Barnacus settled down with a stalk on the ground. He lived like a son of Cnider.

Pollicipes cornucopia
Barnacus bore a son he named Goose. Goose was a great and built a great society, but alas no matter how hard he tried he never became a goose


Goose still claimed his sons were the Geese. And so he is the Eloh of the Geese and their sacred guide


Barnacle geese hang from tree, (Miniature) Barnacle geese, as described by Gerald of Wales. They develop from beams in the water and hang from trees enclosed in shells until they can grow feathers and fly. Image taken from Bestiary. Originally published in England (Salisbury?); 1230-1240.
Among the sons of Goose many grew smaller and more compact. They became the Barnacles we know today, half shrimp half coral full animals


Malacus bore many descendants. Among them the crabs and the shrimp and the isopods and the amphipods. They would become a great dynasty among no peers in the future. So great when we speak of the sons of Crustaceus we speak first and foremost of the great sons of Malacus whose dynasty was yet to reach greatness under the yoke of the Trilobites</text>

After the mists of time cleared again the world was greater. The Planktonic Planimals fed a great new life form.

Leviathan was a great dragon of the sea. Son of the wicked king Magog, Leviathan led his kingdom to peaceful prosperity


The sons of Leviathan grew greater than any before, tenscore myriads of microns long, his body politic was great and full of power. His sons inherited greatness.

The sons of Leviathan ruled the world with great justice. They were shepherds to all the sons of Bios. From the small planktonic planimals to their vicious brothers the Anomalocarids.

Ordovices son of Leviathan was the greatest Emperor of them all, for he built great cities of prosperity that he called reefs.

And so the economy grew like never before. In the great Coral metropolises the sons of Euka gathered far and wide.

Ordovices put the sons of Cnider to work. And so the sons of Anthus built great cities

Ordovices had the daughters of Coraline daughter of Florida daughter of Rhodes build upon the cities too. They built the coralline Algae, the plaster upon the great Corals.

Ordovices saw that the sons of Bryos had no home likewise, and so he blessed them with a home in the great reefs






To this day the great reefs of Ordovices live on as the most prosperous cities of Terra and beyond

And so the economy grew greatly under Ordovices, he became known as the Ordovices the wise, and this boom became known as the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event.

The life of the seas became more prosperous and would only continue to grow greater and more prosperous under the great Ordovician dynasty, twas the first Golden Age</text>

Vertebratus begat Rene

Rene built a great unified system of Nephridia and Generative parts, no longer were they segmented on his sides, now they lived in the core of his being and were centralized together

Rene begat Hemos with his new generative parts

Hemos built a great brain bigger than all others, he built blood vessels as an offering to Hausa

Hausa blessed him by transforming a line of his servants into red carriers of Oxygen

And so his brain was always fed and nourished



Hemos begat Haikus the little fish that could

He thought he couldn’t fly but then he said

I think I can

I think I can

I think I can

And then he flew


Haikus
Haikus became the most accomplished in his line

Haikus begat Lampris and Denton

Denton built great white teeth with enamel

And so Denton is the Eloh of Dentistry and Teeth


To this day we honor Denton through our daily mouth-rite


Magical Powders on a bundle of hoghairs
This rite involves a practice which strikes the stranger as revolting. The ritual consists of inserting a small bundle of hog hairs into the mouth, along with certain magical powders, and then moving the bundle in a highly formalized series of gestures.

Once or twice a year we seek out the holy-mouth-man. These priests have an impressive set of paraphernalia, consisting of a variety of augers, awls, probes, and prods. The use of these items in the exorcism of the evils of the mouth involves almost unbelievable ritual torture of the client. The holy-mouth-man opens the our mouths and, using the above mentioned tools, enlarges any holes which decay may have created in the teeth. He puts magical materials are put into these holes. If there are no naturally occurring holes in the teeth, large sections of one or more teeth are gouged out so that the supernatural substance can be applied. The purpose of these ministrations is clear, to arrest decay and to draw friends. We must continue these traditions as long as Denton smiles upon us

By the will of Denton all his sons must be free to see the holy-mouth-men and never denied this by poverty. The great hero Notgnihsaw demands as much

Conodontus begat Conodon the biter and Pterapsis the flier


Conodon
Conodon was a great bearer of teeth, he swam around with great speed


Pterapsis
Pterapsis built for himself a great suit of armor

Among the sons of Cambrius the sons of Haikus would become the greatest, but this was not to happen immediately

Ghosts struck Terra and wrecked it to its core and so the sons of Conodon disappeared, their teeth marked the end of an era

And so came the end of the Cambrian and the Ordovician began and the sons of Conodon rose again to mark this new era with new teeth for the new era</text>

First Amaterasu blesses us with light. A millionth reaches Terra’s seas

And so the daughters of Bacta farm with her light. First among them the daughters of Saya


Cylindrospermum – Blue Green Algae, microscope photograph
The sons of Viros take their share from the daughters of Saya.


And so the viruses were predators and the daughters of Saya were prey

By the viruses came a new link


The daughter of Pelagia
The daughters of Pelagia, the benevolent sisters of the mitochondria ate the remnants of the Cyanobacteria. And so they grew such great numbers we cannot conceive them

And then there were ye olde purple farmers who came before the daughters of Saya


Ye Olde Purple Farmers
Roseobella a great daughter of the Elah of lesbian motherhood herself among the great purple farmers continue to live as planimals of the sea

Among these bacteria and viruses and detritus alike all were consumed by the great crown-tails the choanoflagellates, our closest cousins



Alongside the sons of Choanos there were the tiny golden algae


Golden Algae
The sons of Dinoflagellus saw the prosperity of the sons of Chrysalgos and Choanos, and so they ate both and photosynthesized.



Sons of Dinoflagellus
And do they gained more energy and prospered

In their prosperity their numbers grew. The water glowed bright in their phototrophic rituals


But soon they grew degenerate

The sons of Dinoflagellus turned to cannibalism and the water grew red with carnage


The blood poisoned all it touched

And soon the Rotifers swooped in

Consuming the remnants of a great civilization the rotifers grew fat and saved us from the plague


1 pixel = 0.407 uM 10X objective 15X eyepiece Numbered tick = 122 uM
Xanthus the Dinoflagellate saw the carnage and fled, as he fled he saw the great glass houses of the Diatoms

Immune to the conquests of Rotifers and the sons of Viros the Diatoms thrived as farmers


Then he saw the coccolithophores who too grew with armored protections


And so he cried out to lord Mithra

Why must my line be deprived of such protections O Lord?

Shall I be forced to live life in danger forever?

And then he saw in the distance

Acanther son of Radios

A great starry greenhouse open to him



And so he lived within Acanther

And he found prosperity within him




Dinoflagellates farming within Radiolarians
Radiolarians as floating greenhouses with glass shells farming algae

Meanwhile the green algaes grew so big they grew protection in numbers


Sargassos the Lord of Kelp grew a city millions of cells wide for he was the greatest of the phytoplankton


And so the Fungi, the sons of Chytros came to break them down

And so they ate them and releases a million spores

The fungi are the Robinhoods of the sea coexisting with the Oomycetes, kelp who want to be fungi

And so they brought energy to all the little creatures of the sea from the great ones


And from here the great zooplankton emerged

The sons of Foramer and sons of Cilliofer

The sons of Foramer in the soils and waters fished in the seas, of the spores and radiolarians and all others


They built great shells, snails built their shells off the shells of his lineage


The sons of Cilliofer were great and used their cillia to suck food into their mouths


Tiny Trilobites ate the sons of Foramer and Cilliofer


The sons of Chordatus burrowed through the soil, finding all that fell there through their gill slits and pumping it out their atriopores


Anatomy of Chordatus

Chordatus
Chordatus begat Olfacter and Lancelot

Lancelot continued the traditions of his father

Olfacter bore two sons:

Vertebratus and Tunicatus

Vertebratus worked on his spinal cord

Tunicus sat on a rock and filtered the water

He pumped water through his filter so much he made it most of his body

Tunicatus bore two sons: Larvaceus and Ascidaceus

Larvaceus never settled, he built a giant house of mucus and fished with it


Ascidaceus became the ancestor of the sea squirts. He built a wooden Tunic of cellulose around himself and filtered

Mouth (top) Atriopore (left) Anus leads into atriopore

Ascidaceus bore two sons: Stolidos and Proteus

While his brethren lived as sea squirts Thalassus built his city floating in the sea


Thalassus bore a son named Dolios who lived a solitary life fishing on his own



The arrow worms and trilobites fed off the sons of Dolios, as did many a jellyfish

But Thallasus bore more sons: Pyros and Salpus who built giant cities and nurtured their young

Pyros
Salpus
Pyros built a giant tube city propelled by wastewater, while Salpus built a great chain of beings</text>

First Amaterasu blesses us with light. A millionth reaches Terra’s seas

And so the daughters of Bacta farm with her light. First among them the daughters of Saya

And so the viruses were predators and the daughters of Saya were prey[[Category:Old Gaiad]]

By the viruses came a new link


The daughter of Pelagia
The daughters of Pelagia, the benevolent sisters of the mitochondria ate the remnants of the Cyanobacteria. And so they grew such great numbers we cannot conceive them

And then there were ye olde purple farmers who came before the daughters of Saya


Ye Olde Purple Farmers
Roseobella a great daughter of the Elah of lesbian motherhood herself among the great purple farmers continue to live as planimals of the sea

Among these bacteria and viruses and detritus alike all were consumed by the great crown-tails the choanoflagellates, our closest cousins



Alongside the sons of Choanos there were the tiny golden algae


Golden Algae
The sons of Dinoflagellus saw the prosperity of the sons of Chrysalgos and Choanos, and so they ate both and photosynthesized.



Sons of Dinoflagellus
And do they gained more energy and prospered

In their prosperity their numbers grew. The water glowed bright in their phototrophic rituals


But soon they grew degenerate

The sons of Dinoflagellus turned to cannibalism and the water grew red with carnage


The blood poisoned all it touched

And soon the Rotifers swooped in

Consuming the remnants of a great civilization the rotifers grew fat and saved us from the plague

Xanthus the Dinoflagellate saw the carnage and fled, as he fled he saw the great glass houses of the Diatoms

Immune to the conquests of Rotifers and the sons of Viros the Diatoms thrived as farmers


Then he saw the coccolithophores who too grew with armored protections


And so he cried out to lord Mithra

Why must my line be deprived of such protections O Lord?

Shall I be forced to live life in danger forever?

And then he saw in the distance

Acanther son of Radios

A great starry greenhouse open to him



And so he lived within Acanther

And he found prosperity within him




Dinoflagellates farming within Radiolarians
Radiolarians as floating greenhouses with glass shells farming algae

Meanwhile the green algaes grew so big they grew protection in numbers


Sargassos the Lord of Kelp grew a city millions of cells wide for he was the greatest of the phytoplankton


And so the Fungi, the sons of Chytros came to break them down

And so they ate them and releases a million spores

The fungi are the Robinhoods of the sea coexisting with the Oomycetes, kelp who want to be fungi

And so they brought energy to all the little creatures of the sea from the great ones


And from here the great zooplankton emerged

The sons of Foramer and sons of Cilliofer

The sons of Foramer in the soils and waters fished in the seas, of the spores and radiolarians and all others


They built great shells, snails built their shells off the shells of his lineage


The sons of Cilliofer were great and used their cillia to suck food into their mouths


Tiny Trilobites ate the sons of Foramer and Cilliofer


The sons of Chordatus burrowed through the soil, finding all that fell there through their gill slits and pumping it out their atriopores


Anatomy of Chordatus

Chordatus
Chordatus begat Olfacter and Lancelot

Lancelot continued the traditions of his father

Olfacter bore two sons:

Vertebratus and Tunicatus

Vertebratus worked on his spinal cord

Tunicus sat on a rock and filtered the water

He pumped water through his filter so much he made it most of his body

Tunicatus bore two sons: Larvaceus and Ascidaceus

Larvaceus never settled, he built a giant house of mucus and fished with it


Ascidaceus became the ancestor of the sea squirts. He built a wooden Tunic of cellulose around himself and filtered

The arrow worms and trilobites fed off the sons of Dolios, as did many a jellyfish

But Thallasus bore more sons: Pyros and Salpus who built giant cities and nurtured their young

Twas the first extinction. Hengweh and Mithra wrestled for years in the sky, blocking out the sun. The archaeocyathids were no more, the Trilobites and Brachiopods and Hyoliths barely survived. The Botomian had ended.

Mithra said unto Wiwaxius: “I choose thee to restore life to the world, and protect us from extinction to come”


Wiwaxius begat Molluscus and Kamptos


Kamptos and his sons on the left, Molluscus on the right
Kamptos was a terrible builder so he built a small brainless kingdom

Molluscus bore many sons: eldest was Testar the sixteen-plated

Testar built a great thick organized shell of 16 valves. Eight on the right and eight on the left

His brothers had bad work ethics. None of them even tried to build shells. Solenos just drank the blood of the sons of Ctenofer and Cnider and Caudos just ate the sons of Foramer

Testar
Chiton Horizontus
Conrhus Verticus
Testar bore two sons: Chiton Horizontus and Conchifer Verticus

Chiton unified his shells horizontally. He became the ancestor of the chitons. Eight shells in a row



The sons of Chiton roll when threatened but they aren’t very smart, they gave up on brains long ago


Conchifer Verticus unified his shells vertically. With a shell on his left and a shell on his right



Conchifer bore two sons: Bivos and Monos


Bivos

Monos
Bivos kept his hinged shell and Monos merged it into one

Bivos laid in the sand and fished food out of the sea, when he was threatened he closed his shells together

His descendants came to lay on their sides, and soon they looked identical to the sons of Brachios. They became the Bivalves



The sons of Monos at first found little success. But as time progressed they grew more successful. Many are called the Monoplacophores, for they have nothing but a single shell as their identity


Modern day Monoplacophore
But Carlos the curly, grandson of Monos had a different idea

He walked across the seas exploring many different places and discovering countless things

He bore two sons: Gastropus and Digitos

Gastropus twisted himself into a spiral, and so his shell developed great strength. He became the ancestor of the snails.


Anatomy of Gastropus the limpet
Each generation curled more and grew stronger


A distant descendant of Gastropus
Digitos made his foot into tentacles


Digitus
He bore two sons: Cephalopus and Scaphopus

Cephalopus studied hard and learned to fly with buoyancy while Scaphopus lived lazily in the ground

Cephalopus built a great coiling spiral shell with flotation chambers within, and through this he flew. He even built for himself a circulatory system like the Annelids and Chordates




Scaphopus became the ancestor of the tusk shells. Simple brainless creatures who live underground and prey on the sons of Foramer.


Through this story we remember how small choices can have huge impacts. The sons of Molluscus flourished and expanded around the world, taking upon themselves all roles they could.</text>

But soon they had competition.


Euthy
Euthy daughter of Mandibulus was being pursued by a great enemy: Anomalocaris the great chased her aggressively. Her precious eggs needed protection, so she did what she had to do, she jumped through the shimmering sky and up the rocks extending to the heavens, and so she burst out of the sea and onto the land.


Euthy collapsed on the ground suffocating in the air. But she and her husband protected their eggs until the end

Among the daughters of Euthy there was Myry the trepanated

Myry the pierced was born like her sisters, but she suffocated in the water. So her father pierced a hole above all 10,000 of her legs. Through these holes she was free to receive the blessings of Hausa directly into her body. To this day her descendants still breathed this way


And so the daughters of Myry could breathe air. They became known as the Myriapods

Myry the pierced maiden explored the new lands she found. She discovered she was not alone.

Tis tradition we call the land she discovered Myry’s coast, but she was not the first one there, we now call it the coast of three kingdoms to acknowledge every side of history



The daughters of Myry
Myry saw the great lichen cities borne of the covenant of Symbio-Mygus and Charina-Planta. Sprawling cities half mold and half moss. Mycelium digging down to the riches of the earth and thallus basking in the blessings of the sun. These great cities spread across the land and whenever cities met both the fungal and the plant citizens married each other.

How each nation married
Reconstruction of the cities of the three kingdoms coast
City structure
Myry ate the cities and stole their nutrients

But as she did she was messy, as she ran around she dropped cells everywhere, all across the globe

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT-e69tVKVw
Reconstruction of Myry’s first raids on the Symbionese Empire
Soon the sons of Mygus and the daughters of Charina built cities all across the land

Myry bore two sons: Cain and Abel

And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Aegis-bearing Mithra. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Aegis-bearing Mithra had respect unto Abel and to his offering: But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. And Aegis-bearing Mithra said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother’s keeper? And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground. And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand; When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. And Cain said unto Aegis-bearing Mithra, My punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. And Aegis-bearing Mithra said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Aegis-bearing Mithra set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. And Cain went out from the presence of Aegis-bearing Mithra, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Centipus: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Centipus.

Cain became the ancestor of the Caintipedes, misspelled as centipedes by the ancient Romans

Abel became the ancestor of the millipedes for his wife was with child, for Cain ripped him into a million pieces

Enraged at the death of Abel Myry lunged at Cain and in their fight both passed on to the realm of Ghedos

In death the sons of Mygus took revenge. Hera daughter of Mygus and Freyr son of Mygus, both in the twentieth generation resided within the corpses of Myry and Cain

As they grew they built great cities, and soon their hyphae met

When they met they married, but they heard a message from Mithra:

O great couple Freyr and Hera your situation is prosperous but it shall be barren for decades to come, postpone consummating your marriage and when you bear children they shall be fruitful and multiply

And so they followed his guidance, and then they married they only married their cells, not their nuclei

And so each cell was shared by each of them, each nucleus was in each cell.


Dikaryotic cells
And so when the two became one they waited decades decomposing the daughters of Myry. They became the ancestors of the high fungi, the great fungi who make mushrooms and penicillin.

Among those sons of Plantus that stayed with the sons of Mygus there were two brothers: Stomatos and Hepatos


Connected to the network at a cellular level they built a great partnership with the sons of Glomulus

Stomatos saw the holes in the sides of the sons of Myry, he pierced holes in himself so he could breathe better

Hepatos refused the foreign magic

And so Hepatos became the ancestor of the Liverworts

And Stomatos ancestor of all other plants


Today we honor Stomatos as the Eloh of transhumanism, of always being better even when you must reassess your beliefs and accept new ideas

As the sons of Stomatos rose Hillu struck back with a venegeance, and so many lineages would be lost forever</text>

But soon they had competition.


Euthy
Euthy daughter of Mandibulus was being pursued by a great enemy: Anomalocaris the great chased her aggressively. Her precious eggs needed protection, so she did what she had to do, she jumped through the shimmering sky and up the rocks extending to the heavens, and so she burst out of the sea and onto the land.


Euthy collapsed on the ground suffocating in the air. But she and her husband protected their eggs until the end

Among the daughters of Euthy there was Myry the trepanated

Myry the pierced was born like her sisters, but she suffocated in the water. So her father pierced a hole above all 10,000 of her legs. Through these holes she was free to receive the blessings of Hausa directly into her body. To this day her descendants still breathed this way[[Category:Old Gaiad]]


And so the daughters of Myry could breathe air. They became known as the Myriapods

Myry the pierced maiden explored the new lands she found. She discovered she was not alone.

Tis tradition we call the land she discovered Myry’s coast, but she was not the first one there, we now call it the coast of three kingdoms to acknowledge every side of history



The daughters of Myry
Myry saw the great lichen cities borne of the covenant of Symbio-Mygus and Charina-Planta. Sprawling cities half mold and half moss. Mycelium digging down to the riches of the earth and thallus basking in the blessings of the sun. These great cities spread across the land and whenever cities met both the fungal and the plant citizens married each other.

How each nation married
Reconstruction of the cities of the three kingdoms coast
City structure
Myry ate the cities and stole their nutrients

But as she did she was messy, as she ran around she dropped cells everywhere, all across the globe

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT-e69tVKVw
Reconstruction of Myry’s first raids on the Symbionese Empire
Soon the sons of Mygus and the daughters of Charina built cities all across the land

Myry bore two sons: Cain and Abel

And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Aegis-bearing Mithra. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Aegis-bearing Mithra had respect unto Abel and to his offering: But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. And Aegis-bearing Mithra said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother’s keeper? And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground. And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand; When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. And Cain said unto Aegis-bearing Mithra, My punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. And Aegis-bearing Mithra said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Aegis-bearing Mithra set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. And Cain went out from the presence of Aegis-bearing Mithra, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Centipus: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Centipus.

Cain became the ancestor of the Caintipedes, misspelled as centipedes by the ancient Romans

Abel became the ancestor of the millipedes for his wife was with child, for Cain ripped him into a million pieces

Enraged at the death of Abel Myry lunged at Cain and in their fight both passed on to the realm of Ghedos

In death the sons of Mygus took revenge. Hera daughter of Mygus and Freyr son of Mygus, both in the twentieth generation resided within the corpses of Myry and Cain

As they grew they built great cities, and soon their hyphae met

When they met they married, but they heard a message from Mithra:

O great couple Freyr and Hera your situation is prosperous but it shall be barren for decades to come, postpone consummating your marriage and when you bear children they shall be fruitful and multiply

And so they followed his guidance, and then they married they only married their cells, not their nuclei

And so each cell was shared by each of them, each nucleus was in each cell.


Dikaryotic cells
And so when the two became one they waited decades decomposing the daughters of Myry. They became the ancestors of the high fungi, the great fungi who make mushrooms and penicillin.

Among those sons of Plantus that stayed with the sons of Mygus there were two brothers: Stomatos and Hepatos


Connected to the network at a cellular level they built a great partnership with the sons of Glomulus

Stomatos saw the holes in the sides of the sons of Myry, he pierced holes in himself so he could breathe better

Hepatos refused the foreign magic

And so Hepatos became the ancestor of the Liverworts

And Stomatos ancestor of all other plants


Today we honor Stomatos as the Eloh of transhumanism, of always being better even when you must reassess your beliefs and accept new ideas

As the sons of Stomatos rose Hillu struck back with a venegeance, and so many lineages would be lost forever</text>

Among the sons of Cambrius there were two hydrostatic sons: Chordatus son of Dutrus and Annelidus son of Protos

Each supported themselves with water pressures, by hydrostasis

Together they saw problems, as they moved their blood moved with them, so they needed to move to nourish their organs

So they built hearts for themselves with veins and arteries and everything

Together each built for themselves closed circulatory systems


Our great bloodlines
Annelon begat Segmentus and Ribbon

Ribbon built for himself a venomous proboscis from which he hunts/ His sons are known as the Ribbon Worms


A son of Ribbon
Segmentus built for himself a body of many segments, repeating his industries and building resilience and building for himself countless legs and bristles

A segment of Segmentus
The body plan of Segmentus
Segmentus begat Pleistos and Amphon


Amphon bore a son and a daughter: Amphinos and Sipuncula



Amphinos became the ancestor of the fire worms, fierce beasts who we never tread on, who walk on poisoned spikes in beautiful colors







Modern flag inspired by Amphinos
Sipuncula became the ancestress of the peanut worms, so different she founded her own phylum

Pleistos begat Vermo and Errantius

Errantius bore two sons: Myzo the parasite and Greatswimmer

Greatswimmer bore a son and a daughter: Phyllos the fast and Eunice the vicious

Eunice the vicious was a jealous woman, so she stole her husband’s phallus and impregnated herself without him

Her daughters are known as the Bobbit Worms


Phyllos bore a myriad sons who swim across the oceans with great diversity and artistry


Phyllos
Syllides the lazy. Unwilling to put in the time and effort of dating he just buds off a new member every month to pursue women for him


Syllides
Tomopteris who breaks off his fins as chaff and swims never touching ground


Tomopteris
Alciops the hawkeyed, the great hunter whose eyes outstrip all others




And Aphrodite ancestress of the sea mice


A daughter of Aphrodite
Vermo bore four daughters: Eartha Sapion Hestia and Orbinida

Eartha would walk great distances on the Earth

Sapion bore two daughters: Sabella the feathered and Spiona the tentacled


A daughter of Spiona
Sabella bore many daughters who live as fishermen. We call them the feather duster worms. To this day we keep them in every temple to remind us worms can be beautiful too.


Hestia swam deep down to the womb of Gaia, there she came to live like her ancestors before her. She closed her gut and uses bacteria to live where she otherwise couldn’t. Her daughters continue to farm the depths below.


Among her daughters are Riftia who lives in volcanic vents, and Lamella who lives in the lands of oil, the cold seeps

Eartha bore a daughter and a son: Terraclithia and Echiuron

Echiuron like Sipuncula before her was a great woman with great creativity, so much creativity we thought her her own phylum

Terraclithia bore two daughters: Terebella and Clitella

Terebella bore three sons: Spaghettes Pompeii and Acros

Spaghettes
Pompeii
Acros
Spaghettes used his giant tentacles to ensnare prey from miles away

Pompeii would live in volcanoes

Acros became the ancestor of Squidworm and Swima


Clitella bore many daughters too. Her head was small but her clit thought for her. What she lacked in bristles and legs she made up for with children. Her children lived in rivers and today we know them as Earthworms and Leeches</text>

Arthur bore two sons: Arthropus the double-legged and Fuxi


Fuxi
Arthropus the double-legged bore Ferron and Isoxys

Ferron begat Megacheiron and Euthyphro

Megacheiron bore many sons among them Pantopus


Pyka
Pantopus was lonely, but one day he met Pyka

Pyka was amazingly beautiful, Pantopus said she was all legs

And so they became the ancestors of the Sea Spiders


Sea Spider by @ni075
The sea spiders built their cities with all their organs in their legs, intestines and genitals and gills all in legs. With no coelom they are all legs

Euthyphro begat Insectus and Arachnus

From the line of Insectus would come the insects, and from the line of Arachnus would come the arachnids


Left: Sons of Arachnus, Right: Sons of Insectus
Top: Aquatic, Bottom: Terrestrial
The sons of Arachnus bore great appendages and the sons of Insectus bore great legs

Insectus bore three sons: Mandibulus and Aquilonifer and Hymenocarina

Mandibulus bore two sons: Crustaceus and Euthy

The sons of Cruscateus became the Crustaceans, and the sons of Euthy walked on the rocks of the coasts facing the asphyxiating dryness alongside the water bears. Twas here they laid their eggs and partook in the gardens of lichen. So too would the insects emerge from the sons of Crustaceus to conquer the land once again


Euthy
Arachnus begat Trilos and Serk

Serk bore many sons: among them Chelicer and Sidney


Chelicer
The sons of Chelicer would remain small in his time, today among them are the spiders and all the arachnids


A son of Chelicer attending church
Among the daughters of Trilobos there were Trilobon and Marrella and Esmeralda and Retifacia

Marella was soft and ghostly, the became the ancestress of the Marellans


Trilobon begat Trilobeth and Xander and Necta and Helmut

Trilobeth became the ancestress of the Trilobites. The great rulers of the sea. And through their conquest they brought the Yakutian era


Trilobeth begat Redlich and Agnos

Redlich
Agnos
Redlich begat Corynex and Ptychos

Corynex built the great house of Corynex

Lichida son of Corynex built the great house of Lichida

Odontos son of Lichida built the great spiny house of Odontos

Corynex
Lichida
Odontos
Ptychos begat Proetes, Asaphus, Harpeth, and Phacos

Ptychos
Proetes
Asaphus
Harpeth</text>

Arthur bore two sons: Arthropus the double-legged and Fuxi


Fuxi
Arthropus the double-legged bore Ferron and Isoxys

Ferron begat Megacheiron and Euthyphro
[[Category:Old Gaiad]]
Megacheiron bore many sons among them Pantopus


Pyka
Pantopus was lonely, but one day he met Pyka

Pyka was amazingly beautiful, Pantopus said she was all legs

And so they became the ancestors of the Sea Spiders


Sea Spider by @ni075
The sea spiders built their cities with all their organs in their legs, intestines and genitals and gills all in legs. With no coelom they are all legs

Euthyphro begat Insectus and Arachnus

From the line of Insectus would come the insects, and from the line of Arachnus would come the arachnids


Left: Sons of Arachnus, Right: Sons of Insectus
Top: Aquatic, Bottom: Terrestrial
The sons of Arachnus bore great appendages and the sons of Insectus bore great legs

Insectus bore three sons: Mandibulus and Aquilonifer and Hymenocarina

Mandibulus bore two sons: Crustaceus and Euthy

The sons of Cruscateus became the Crustaceans, and the sons of Euthy walked on the rocks of the coasts facing the asphyxiating dryness alongside the water bears. Twas here they laid their eggs and partook in the gardens of lichen. So too would the insects emerge from the sons of Crustaceus to conquer the land once again


Euthy
Arachnus begat Trilos and Serk

Serk bore many sons: among them Chelicer and Sidney


Chelicer
The sons of Chelicer would remain small in his time, today among them are the spiders and all the arachnids


A son of Chelicer attending church
Among the daughters of Trilobos there were Trilobon and Marrella and Esmeralda and Retifacia

Marella was soft and ghostly, the became the ancestress of the Marellans


Trilobon begat Trilobeth and Xander and Necta and Helmut

Trilobeth became the ancestress of the Trilobites. The great rulers of the sea. And through their conquest they brought the Yakutian era


Trilobeth begat Redlich and Agnos

Redlich
Agnos
Redlich begat Corynex and Ptychos

Corynex built the great house of Corynex

Lichida son of Corynex built the great house of Lichida

Odontos son of Lichida built the great spiny house of Odontos

Corynex
Lichida
Odontos
Ptychos begat Proetes, Asaphus, Harpeth, and Phacos

The twin sons born to Dutrus were Saccorhytus the lame and Dietrich the Patriarch

Saccorhytus the lame never grew up. He stayed as larvae forever


Saccorhytus
The sons of Saccorhytus were sparse and weak

In his youth Dietrich the patriarch looked much like his frail brother


Dietrich young
But as he grew he matured.

He built for himself gill slits to filter the ground

A great tail extending past his anus so he could swim well

A heart to nourish all his subjects

And two great nerve cords dorsal and ventral


Until he grew great and big.


Anatomy of Dutrus
The sons of Dietrich spread across the world and grew great

They had great fortune so this time was called the time of Fortune. The Fortunian

Firstborn were twins Ambulus and Chordatus

Ambulus
Chordatus
Ambulus and Chordatus
With the sons of Proteus they vassalized the sons of Ediacar

Ambulus settled on a rock, while Chordatus centralized his ecclesiarchy, so one spinal cord on his back.


Chordatus needed more support, so he built a notochord. And so was born the spinal cord. Chordatus became the patriarch of all chordates and all vertebrates.



From his spinal cord cane our brainstem

The sons of Ambulus followed local leaders and shamans, for they needed no great lords above them.

The sons of Ambulus would become the acorn worms and the echinoderms


The sons of Dutrus saw the end of the Ediacaran Empire. And so truly began the Cambrian era.

Bluebelle the Sea Squirt
Snowfloof the Vertebrate
Starfy the Echinoderm
Among the sons of Nephrus the sons of Dutrus were late bloomers. They took long to perfect their arts but once there they were unstoppable. From the sons of Chordatus came the Vertebrates and the Sea Squirts, and from the sons of Ambulus came the Echinoderms: The Starfish and the Sea Urchins


In the last days the sons of Nephrus shouted Ediacaro Delendo Est and left behind them great symbols of their power Treptichnal burrows and oxygenized soils.


A son of Ectus in his Treptichnal burrow
And so Ediacaro was destroyed. The mats of Saya and the depths of Desulfa were destroyed.</text>

Twas the age of the three patriarchs: Dutrus Ectus and Spiralius

Among these patriarchs Ectus was the most vicious

With his great mouth he ripped through his enemies

He raided the sons of Isomeres and the sponges

He built a great complex mouth, and he molted his skin and mouth periodically, he shed his cilia and used amoebae as sperm

And he stripped his coelom to the basics. Removed unnecessary scaffolding.

So his organs floated freely in his pseudocoelom


Ectus specialized in burrowing and eating sediment dwelling organisms with its teeth. Became the first predator of the sons of Dutrus and Spiralius


In his viciousness Ectus begat a horde of worms who conquered the world

Ectus ripped through the earth and destroyed the soil

Ectus begat Ishmael and Isaac


Tomb of a son of Ectus
Ishmael held fast to the traditions of his father, while Isaac was an innovator


The firstborn line of Ishmael held fast to the traditions of Ectus. Priapus son of Ishmael became patriarch of the Priapulids who live deep in the oceans to this day, in lands like the ancient Ediacaran lands of hydrogen sulfide and without oxygen

Draco brother of Priapus became the patriarch of the mud dragons: Horrific monsters who live in the muds everywhere


Mud Dragon
Isaac bore Nematus and Rhineheart


Nematus
Nematus was an agile nomad. He bore two sons: Nematus II and Gordy

Nematus and Gordy both were prodigal sons

Both became parasites, but in age Nematus rejected that lifestyle and took the lifestyle of his father. He became the ancestor of the many great worms. 80% of animals are his descendants.


The city of Nematus
Gordy became the ancestor of the Gordian worms. Horrific parasites living in the bodies of their brothers


The sons of Gordius
Rhineheart begat Lobopus and Loricus

Loricus built for himself a thick suit of armor. He married Siri and his sons live deep in the mysterious depths of the sea. For a 500 million years we thought them dead, only in the year of 1983 were they rediscovered


Lobopus married Panar

Lobopus built feet for himself extending from his body, and eyes. He reinforced his coelom

And so his great city could walk

And he built a heart for his city to spread nourishment to everyone


A traditional son of Lobopus
This changed everything. No longer would the sons of Cambrius be limited to petty fishing. They could finally challenge the sons of Ctenofer and the sons of Cnider.

The sons of Lobopus multiplied across the Earth and took upon themselves myriad forms. Their conquest seemed inevitable.


His sons rule the world today in three clans, the clan of Ursus

Ayeisha
A modern member
Ursus the bear
Members of the clan of Ursus
The clan of Velvetclaw


A modern Velvetclaw honoring his ancestor
And greatest of all the clan of Arthropus


A daughter of Arthropus
But in this age they had no divisions into tribes. They were all united as sons of Lobopus and daughters of Panar.</text>

Symbio-Mygus son of Mygus, and Charina-Planta daughter of Plantus

Symbio-Mygus was the son in the tenth generation of Zygos the great fungus of the rivers

Charina-Planta was the daughter in the tenth generation of Charina the alga of the rivers


Charina’s cells
Symbio-Mygus and Charina-Planta married and created a great agricultural empire on the shores of the lake of Lichen. A fusion of plant and fungus to conquer the land

When the lake dried they went dormant, and when it rose they rose again

Together they bore many children, the Lichens


The City of Symbio-Mygus
There were countless lichens among the sons of Symbio-Mygus and the daughters of Charina-Planta. They took upon themselves countless forms

Fruticose Lichen
Foliose Lichen
Crustose Lichen
The great Fruticose Lichens who grow great branches and leaves

Amber married Arbusculus and they bore Glomer and Ashley

Ashley married Wort and they became the ancestors of the plants and the mosses.

Ashley and Wort traded with Glomer. Glomer dug into the ground like his Lichenous brethren for nutrients, while Ashley farmed in the sun.

Hecate was a great Hexenmaiden

She begat a great Hex

A Hex, a Hox, a Homeobox

And by her Hox Aristos found direction in life


In Pennsylvania the daughters of Hecate have been making Hox signs for centuries, to mark the bilateral symmettry of their buildings and bring order to the cosmos. We continue their tradition in our own homes and temples

Hox signs in Pennsylvania
Hox sign molecules
With their Homeobox Paraxus and Hecate faced the direction of God

To Aegis-bearing Jehovah, All-Knowing Mithra, All-loving Elohim

Their city was pointed in the sacred direction, best to catch currents.



The sons of Paraxus
And so bilateral symmetry came to be and life found direction


In his youth Paraxus lived as a nomad in the waves, and in age he crawled across the seafloor grazing upon the greens of the seas and the riches of Davy Jones

Paraxus bore three sons: Bilateron and Cnider and Placus


Cnider
Cnider built from each lobe of his body a new mouth from which he fished

Placus kept his simple body to this day



The only placozoan cells
Bilateron continued the tradition of Paraxus, crawling on the ground for greater prey.

To help Bilateron built for himself a pair of observatories manned by a great priesthood of astrologers.

The astrologers came together in pits and looked to the stars for guidance

With the blessing of Lord Carotenus and the incantation PAX6 they built eyes for themselves


Bilateron married Vendia and together they bore Coelomus and Xenus

The sons of Xenus held fast to his traditions. To this day they keep their traditions


Sons of Xenus
Among the sons of Xenus there was Roscoff the great. The farmer who married Tetraselma the alga. Together they became Patriarch and Matriarch of the Roscoff worms.

From afar
Close up
Millions of Roscoff worms
Coelomus sent his stomach so deep it went through his body and out, so it became his anus

Mesoglea to mesoderm with membranes and cavities there was much room to build

In his coelom he built his kidneys, his nephridia, and from his ectoderm he brought in a great telegraph network connecting every citizen together


Nephrus innervating his city

Coelomus married Kimberella and together they bore Nephrus


Nephrus built for himself small kidneys across his body


Nephrus married Ikaria and together they bore Cambrius


Cambrius segmented his body into countless repeating units, each with sophisticated scaffolding, and a heart pumping between his segments

He unified his million nerves of the cord together. What would this great temple of knowledge be called? Today we call it the brain and Cambrius Eloh of Brains


When Cambrius needed food he took all information from ventral and dorsal nerve cords

He saw prey or smelled prey

And each segment pulsated as he moved forward

When he swallowed it went down his intestine

in each segment nutrition flowed from endoderm to mesoderm and into coelom

And so the hemolymph was filled with harvest

Pumped from each segment to the next by the heart

As his subjects needed oxygen it came in through the skin

As the harvest was eaten so Cambrius filled with Ammonia

So out his Nephridia the ammonia flowed, out each side on every segment

Cambrius married Spriggina

And each sent their genes out through their nephridia

The sperm of Cambrius left the same path the ammonia left, and it met the eggs of Spriggina

And so they became allfather and allmother</text>

To Aegis-bearing Jehovah, All-Knowing Mithra, All-loving Elohim

Their city was pointed in the sacred direction, best to catch currents.



The sons of Paraxus
And so bilateral symmetry came to be and life found direction

[[File:Paraxus-4.svg|frameless]]



In his youth Paraxus lived as a nomad in the waves, and in age he crawled across the seafloor grazing upon the greens of the seas and the riches of Davy Jones

Paraxus bore three sons: Bilateron and Cnider and Placus


Cnider
Cnider built from each lobe of his body a new mouth from which he fished

Placus kept his simple body to this day



The only placozoan cells
Bilateron continued the tradition of Paraxus, crawling on the ground for greater prey.

To help Bilateron built for himself a pair of observatories manned by a great priesthood of astrologers.

The astrologers came together in pits and looked to the stars for guidance

With the blessing of Lord Carotenus and the incantation [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAX6 PAX6] they built eyes for themselves

[[File:Bilateron-1.svg|frameless]]
Bilateron married Vendia and together they bore Coelomus and Xenus

The sons of Xenus held fast to his traditions. To this day they keep their traditions

[[File:Acoel Flatworms (Waminoa sp.) on Bubble Coral (Plerogyra sinuosa) - Panglima, Pulau Mabul, Sabah, Malaysia.jpg|441x441px]]
Sons of Xenus
Among the sons of Xenus there was Roscoff the great. The farmer who married Tetraselma the alga. Together they became Patriarch and Matriarch of the Roscoff worms.

From afar
Close up
Millions of Roscoff worms
Coelomus sent his stomach so deep it went through his body and out, so it became his anus

Mesoglea to mesoderm with membranes and cavities there was much room to build

In his coelom he built his kidneys, his nephridia, and from his ectoderm he brought in a great telegraph network connecting every citizen together

[[File:Neural_crest.svg]]

[[File:Coelomus.svg|frameless|500x500px]]



Nephrus innervating his city

Coelomus married Kimberella and together they bore Nephrus


Nephrus built for himself small kidneys across his body

[[File:Nephrus.svg|frameless]]



Nephrus married Ikaria and together they bore Cambrius


Cambrius segmented his body into countless repeating units, each with sophisticated scaffolding, and a heart pumping between his segments

He unified his million nerves of the cord together. What would this great temple of knowledge be called? Today we call it the brain and Cambrius Eloh of Brains


[[File:Cambrius.svg|frameless]]



When Cambrius needed food he took all information from ventral and dorsal nerve cords

He saw prey or smelled prey

And each segment pulsated as he moved forward

When he swallowed it went down his intestine

in each segment nutrition flowed from endoderm to mesoderm and into coelom

And so the hemolymph was filled with harvest

Pumped from each segment to the next by the heart

As his subjects needed oxygen it came in through the skin

As the harvest was eaten so Cambrius filled with Ammonia

So out his Nephridia the ammonia flowed, out each side on every segment

Cambrius married Spriggina

And each sent their genes out through their nephridia

The sperm of Cambrius left the same path the ammonia left, and it met the eggs of Spriggina

And so they became allfather and allmother</text>

Eziz bore many gametes, some big and some small, but the smallest and cheapest one thrived

His son Spermon was barely more than a virus with a flagellum to push him far away

A true deadbeat who brought shame to his father

Since he gave so little to women he could make a billion sperm cells and outcompete all honest men

Oenone had a bad daughter too

Her daughter Kegaine was a selfish gene, a murderess and an egg.

As she went through Meiosis she stole cytoplasm from her sisters. She was a selfish gene and stole from her sisters in every generation

And so she was the egg and her three sisters became the polar bodies. She murdered them and they blebbed into apoptotic demise



A cell being murdered by Kegaine the Selfish
And so the selfish genes thrived and the altruistic genes died out

This is how eggs began, the genes fight and one wins. If all have Kegaines gene then all lines fight until one wins out

Among countless other sperm, Spermon sought to fertilize Kegaine

As he had a million brethren Spermons line won out over the others


Spermon inseminating Kegain before abandoning her
Neither Spermon nor Kegaine was virtuous, but they bore the greatest patriarch and the greatest matriarch

Horus the two-horned son of heaven, and Mahatma Maat the all-mother

Horus tired of living in the underworld under ice

So he challenged Hengweh for rulership of Terra

He demanded attention from all the Elohim for his coup

But alas they had little hope.

Amaterasu was so depressed she nearly dimmed out

Horus demanded to challenge Hengweh and eventually Hengweh agreed that he would let him be king for a week every 78 years if he beat him at any game of his choosing

In his wisdom and age Hengweh was a master of all the classic games

So Horus challenged him to a match of a new game, he challenged him to a match of Fortnite

Not knowing what Fortnite was Hengweh lost and so Horus won a leap week every 78 years

So every 78 years Horus would spend a week warming the planet, and soon some of the people under the ice could see the sky, and photosynthesis returned for a week every 78 years

Hengweh saw this with dismay, so he offered Horus a bet, he could get 13 more weeks per cycle if he won a game, and would lose his week if he lost, and Hengweh would choose the game.

Horus accepted and the game was a scavenger hunt. Whoever found the oldest rock would win.

Horus first went to the Jack Hills in Australia for he thought of the Zircons there, but Hengweh ripped out the eye of Horus so he couldn’t see the Zircons

Hengweh cast his eye into space, but alas his eye reached Mithra


The eye of Horus
With the eye of Horus Mithra saw all. Mithra saw a much older stone, a meteor from the beginning of all time

Mithra sent the meteor to Horus and so Horus won 13 more weeks

So every six years Horus would have a week to warm the world, and every 78 years he had two weeks. This is why we have leap years.

With Mithra and Horus together tradition was revived. Mithra and Horus conspired together to bring order back to the world


Our money represents the duality of Horus on the right and Mithra on the left
In a brutal battle with Hengweh Horus finally defeated Hengweh, but Hengweh summoned Hillu

And Hillu-Hengweh sent a meteor to Terra

But Mithra took advantage of this. He directed the meteor to break the icy prison

The meteor struck Sudbury and Oxygenated the entire world

All we have to remind us of this era are the bands of Iron deep in the ground


Ancient Relics of the rule of Hengweh. It is from these rocks we get 60% of our iron
Horus and Mithra reinvigorated Amaterasu and ordered her to brighten. So the world became bright again and life thrived again

Hilluhengweh was banished to the hinterlands, but no matter how hard they tried Mithra and Horus couldn’t kill him

Horus built a great protective wall in the sky. A wall of ozone that protected life from radiation. A wall we maintain to this day

And so to this day Mithra continues to vigorously maintain his institutions with each new generation, he shall never lose another election

So on this day in the year 12 billion and 151 million the Medieval Age of Terra began.

Some call this era the Boring Billion, but it was a time of great advancement and hardly boring at all.

To this day we go on pilgrimages to Sudbury Ontario to celebrate the deeds of Horus


The protective Ozone layer Horus made for us
It was in this time that the great Supercontinent Columbia formed


Horus bore a son named Thoth, and his sister Mahatma Maat bore two daughters named Seshat and Sophia

Horus carefully methylated his son so he would learn the virtuous ways, but Mahatma Maat was careless, she only methylated Seshat well and not Sophia

Seshat married Thoth Nectarius son of Horus the double-horned

In her arrogance Sophia refused to find a husband. She believed she was beyond all criticism and bore a son on her own

Incubus was her son and he was a great demiurge


Incubus ancestor of the Euglena
Incubus built great nightmarish visions and worlds for all to see, but he thought they were beautiful

He had no guidance and no father, his traditions were corrupted and his methylation pointless.


Sons of Incubus causing African sleeping sickness
When Horus died Thoth and Incubus fought over his mantle.

When Thoth slept Incubus tried to steal his mantle


Incubus the Demiurge
Thoth was paralyzed but by force of will he clutched his father’s mantle so hard Incubus couldn’t steal it

And to this day the sons of Incubus and Succubus enter our nightmares and give us sleeping sickness and Chagas disease and Elephantitis. But they can never steal the mantle of our father Horus

Protist family tree

The marriage of Thoth and Seshat was a great one

Each gave their full genomes. And so their children were Tetraploid


Chromosome 3 breaks in two at the centromere with neocentromeres forming, making the couple a unique species

It is always hard to live with polyploid chromosomes. How can the centrioles figure out which scroll goes where when there are four identical ones not two?

So Thoth and Seshat found a solution

Chromosome 1 remained as is

Chromosome 1.5 split at the centromere

With no centromeres on either half the chromosomes received new ones.

Their enzymes created neocentromeres with new histones in the centers of the new scrolls 4 and 5

Telomerase created new Telomeres for the new scrolls

Chromosomes 2 and 3 remained intact

But chromosomes 2.5 and 3.5 accidentally crossed over


The mutations of scrolls 2.5 and 3.5
First a piece of 2.5 got lost and inserted in 3.5

Then the ends of them swapped between each other

And so 2.5 became 6 and 3.5 became 7

And so they went from Tetraploid to Diploid again and genetic stability was reobtained

With more chromosomes their house had more redundancy. Many inscriptions could change in one location but not another, and so new abilities could be gained without losing others

Thoth and Seshat begat Jimmu and Percolos and Jingu

Like his brethren Percolos was a shapeshifter. He changed from Amoeba to flagellate as he pleased and even to cyst when he need remain dormant


Percolos
Percolos never specialized and his children are few and far between

And so the sons of Percolos invade our brains in envy, they are the brain eating amoebae


Jimmu begat Nectarius and Luka

Luka begat Jakob and Tsukuba

Neither Jakob nor Tsukuba were intelligent or talented


To this day billions of years later their descendants are remembered for not being descended from Nectarius

Nectarius was a great one

Nectarius married Ambrosia daughter of Jingu and they bore twin boys Animus and Plantus and twin girls Opima and Cortica

Opima was a huntress and Cortica was a gatheress

Cortica and Plantus begat Plastidus and Hacroses and Cryptina

Plastidus married Chlora the Cyanobacteria, and so Chlora became the chloroplast like Eve became the Mitochondria


Plastidus and Chlora begat Glauca and Alges and Alga

Glauca took greatly after her mother.

Her chloroplasts bore dresses of Peptidoglycan Sequins, while neither Alges nor Alga had such dresses


Glauca adopted the traditions of her mother rather than those of her mother.

Glauca was a simple woman who had many daughters by herself. They spread across the world and grew great in numbers, for her daughters needed no husbands they had new daughters constantly. The daughters of Glauca are known for their strict traditions, but their numbers have declined in recent times.

In the age of the Proterozoic they were numerous for they cloned themselves without limitations

But they are rare today, for without sex they remained primitive

All the daughters of Glauca are clones today


A few daughters of Glauca
Alga stripped her chloroplast of her Peptidoglycan dress. She built a beautiful sophisticated network of solar panels in her chloroplast


Algas chloroplast
Alges and Alga married and begat Rhodes and Vert

Rhodes was the Patriarch of Red Algae and Vert the Matriarch of Green Algae

Each of them could use their plastids in many ways


Types of Plastids
Dormant Etioplasts that would become Chloroplasts with sunlight

That’s why potatoes turn green in the sun

By the power of Nightshade and Sunshine potatoes grow green and toxic


A green poisonous potato
Colorful Chromoplasts blessed by Lord Carotenus himself

They keep their Carotenoids between their membranes

And show themselves ripe for picking










Chromoplasts and Carotenoids in action
And there were the Leucoplasts. Granaries that store food for hard times

Amyloplasts store starchy grain for hard times. We farm grain ourselves to eat from the stores of Amyloplasts


Amyloplasts in action
Elaioplasts that store oily lard for hard times


Olive oil comes from Elaioplasts
And proteinoplasts that store protein for hard times


Proteinoplasts give nuts protein
The sons of Rhodes were very numerous and quickly spread across the entire world. Their pigments were superior so they absorbed more light than the daughters of Vert


Accessory Pigments of Rhodes
While Plastidus was the ancestor of Plants, Hacroses was the ancestor of a great many others

Hacroses begat Haroses and Haptistus

Haroses bore three sons: Heterokon and Alveolus and Rhizar


The many members of the house of Haroses
Heterokon bore three sons: Ochros and Oomy and Bigyres

Bigyra
Oomy
Ochros found a daughter of Rhodes named Rosa, he stole her and married her


The endosymbiosis of Rosie
Ochros kept her in his house and she became the chloroplast of his lineage

Ochros bore countless children who are much of algae today, Diana the Beautiful, Kelpus the Giant, and Synura the fragrant, and Chrysanthema

Daughters of Diana
Daughters of Synura
Daughters of Chrysanthema
Sons of Kelpus


Kelpus built great cities with millions of farmers. They became the great Kelp forests of the seas.

Diana married Silicon and so her daughters built great shells of silicon for themselves. Nobody mastered silicon as well as her until Silicon Valley

The Diatoms create great fertile sands, Diatomaceous Earth


Bodélé Depression
When the great ancient lake of chad dried up the Diatoms formed great fertile sand. Every year Azoth carries the sand across the Atlantic to the Amazon Rainforest


Many were jealous of the successes of Ochros

Among them Alveolus the younger, son of Alveolus the Elder, cousin of Ochros

Alveolus the younger stole Okra daughter of Ochros, and so his line gained the power of the sun as well

But many were not so lucky

Rhizar, Oomy brother of Ochros, Haptos son of Haptistus, and Cryptos son of Cryptista formed a pact

They formed the Solar Coalition, to take the power of the son for them all

Cryptos was quickly successful, with a jetpack of his own blood he fled the union


Cryptos, his ejectosome is his jetpack
The Solar union, sometimes called the sun animalcules had a mission, to take the power of the sun for the people

And so they took on the form of the sun to pursue their goals.


Heliozoan coat of arms representing the three lineages clockwise from top Oomy/Actinophryids Haptista/Centrohelids and Granofilosea
Alas the mission was long. Haptos bore two sons: Haptos Jr, and Helios

Haptos was the eldest of the union, he did not live to see the successes of his sons

Haptos Jr was successful in stealing a daughter of Ochros and his line became the Haptophytes

Haptos built for himself a great suit of armor



Helios son of Haptos became the ancestor of the Centrohelids, to this day they have had no success

Helios was a vicious predator with his spikes he consumed all he touched.


Helios
Oomy grew a great assortment of spines, Solar tendrils. Of the house Helios.

Oomy bore two sons: Actinophrys was the son of Oomy who never bettered himself

Oomygus build his spines into a great mining network, he became the ancestor of the water moulds




Oomygus Life Cycle
Among the sons of Bigyra there was Minos the Labyrinthmaker


Minos built a great rail network form slime, he moved around on them and ate all the nutrients he found


He built a great civilization and bore many sons who formed the house of the Labyrinth

Rhizar was like a snail. An amoeba with a shell and blood red spikes

He bore many sons and most of them abandoned the Solar order

Rhizar
Vampyrus
Alveolus and and Okra begat Cilliofer and Myzo


Cilliofer became the ancestor of the Cilliophores. Trumpet Slipper Bell and Swan Animalcules Belle bore two daughters: Vorticella who held giant parties, and Ophrydia who cloned herself so much she ceases to be an animalcule



Stentors







They formed a new form of meiosis called Conjugation



Myzo was a vampire that drank the cytoplasm of other cells

Myzo begat Dinoflagellus and Malarius

Dinoflagellus was the ancestor of the Dinoflagellates, swimming algae who feed coral


The sons of Dinoflagellus bear great armored plates


They grew great and prosperous and so they made the water glow


But they turned to carnivory and even cannibalism

And so the water turned red with blood


Malarius was the ancestor of the Apicomplexans. Parasites who gave up on photosynthesis and give us diseases like Malaria


We use medicines targeting their non functioning chloroplasts to stop them


Among the sons of Incubus there was Eugenius

Eugenius married Pyramimonas of the house of Vert and left the evil ways of his fathers. He became the ancestor of the Euglenas, swimming algae between plants and animals, yet all the same more distant from either one than each is from each other



Eugenius the Euglena
Euglenia stored her wealth not as starch but as Paramylon, for she was an alien to the plants and animals


Paramylon
Animus and Opima became the ancestors of the Unikonts

A great clan who we all descend from

They begat Ozymandias and Malawi.

Ozymandias begat Podius and Metamon

Metamon hated women so he never married

Metamon bore sons with no mother and so he has no Mitochondria and his sons only live away from oxygen. They live in the stomachs of cows and give us beaver fever


Podius begat Menes and Ancyromon

Menes begat Amorpheus and Malandas

Malandas begat Mantamonas and Variscus

Amorpheus was our ancestor. The great all-knowing all-living one

In the year 13 billion the world was covered by the great supercontinent Rodinia


The world at 13 billion
The daughters of Rhodes became numerous and prosperous

Rhizar, Oomy brother of Ochros, Haptos son of Haptistus, and Cryptos son of Cryptista formed a pact

They formed the Solar Coalition, to take the power of the son for them all

Cryptos was quickly successful, with a jetpack of his own blood he fled the union


Cryptos, his ejectosome is his jetpack
The Solar union, sometimes called the sun animalcules had a mission, to take the power of the sun for the people

And so they took on the form of the sun to pursue their goals.


Heliozoan coat of arms representing the three lineages clockwise from top Oomy/Actinophryids Haptista/Centrohelids and Granofilosea
Alas the mission was long. Haptos bore two sons: Haptos Jr, and Helios

Haptos was the eldest of the union, he did not live to see the successes of his sons

Haptos Jr was successful in stealing a daughter of Ochros and his line became the Haptophytes

Haptos built for himself a great suit of armor



Helios son of Haptos became the ancestor of the Centrohelids, to this day they have had no success

Helios was a vicious predator with his spikes he consumed all he touched.


Helios
Oomy grew a great assortment of spines, Solar tendrils. Of the house Helios.

Oomy bore two sons: Actinophrys was the son of Oomy who never bettered himself

Oomygus build his spines into a great mining network, he became the ancestor of the water moulds




Oomygus Life Cycle
Among the sons of Bigyra there was Minos the Labyrinthmaker


Minos built a great rail network form slime, he moved around on them and ate all the nutrients he found


He built a great civilization and bore many sons who formed the house of the Labyrinth

Rhizar was like a snail. An amoeba with a shell and blood red spikes

He bore many sons and most of them abandoned the Solar order

Rhizar
Vampyrus
Alveolus and and Okra begat Cilliofer and Myzo


Cilliofer became the ancestor of the Cilliophores. Trumpet Slipper Bell and Swan Animalcules Belle bore two daughters: Vorticella who held giant parties, and Ophrydia who cloned herself so much she ceases to be an animalcule



Stentors







They formed a new form of meiosis called Conjugation



Myzo was a vampire that drank the cytoplasm of other cells

Myzo begat Dinoflagellus and Malarius

Dinoflagellus was the ancestor of the Dinoflagellates, swimming algae who feed coral


The sons of Dinoflagellus bear great armored plates


They grew great and prosperous and so they made the water glow


But they turned to carnivory and even cannibalism

And so the water turned red with blood


Malarius was the ancestor of the Apicomplexans. Parasites who gave up on photosynthesis and give us diseases like Malaria


We use medicines targeting their non functioning chloroplasts to stop them


Among the sons of Incubus there was Eugenius

Eugenius married Pyramimonas of the house of Vert and left the evil ways of his fathers. He became the ancestor of the Euglenas, swimming algae between plants and animals, yet all the same more distant from either one than each is from each other



Eugenius the Euglena
Euglenia stored her wealth not as starch but as Paramylon, for she was an alien to the plants and animals


Paramylon
Animus and Opima became the ancestors of the Unikonts

A great clan who we all descend from

They begat Ozymandias and Malawi.

Ozymandias begat Podius and Metamon

Metamon hated women so he never married

Metamon bore sons with no mother and so he has no Mitochondria and his sons only live away from oxygen. They live in the stomachs of cows and give us beaver fever


Podius begat Menes and Ancyromon

Menes begat Amorpheus and Malandas

Malandas begat Mantamonas and Variscus

Amorpheus was our ancestor. The great all-knowing all-living one

In the year 13 billion the world was covered by the great supercontinent Rodinia


The world at 13 billion
The daughters of Rhodes became numerous and prosperous

Eziz bore many gametes, some big and some small, but the smallest and cheapest one thrived

His son Spermon was barely more than a virus with a flagellum to push him far away

A true deadbeat who brought shame to his father

Since he gave so little to women he could make a billion sperm cells and outcompete all honest men
[[Category:Pre-Outage Pages]]
Oenone had a bad daughter too

Her daughter Kegaine was a selfish gene, a murderess and an egg.[[Category:Old Gaiad]]

As she went through Meiosis she stole cytoplasm from her sisters. She was a selfish gene and stole from her sisters in every generation

And so she was the egg and her three sisters became the polar bodies. She murdered them and they blebbed into apoptotic demise



A cell being murdered by Kegaine the Selfish
And so the selfish genes thrived and the altruistic genes died out

This is how eggs began, the genes fight and one wins. If all have Kegaines gene then all lines fight until one wins out

Among countless other sperm, Spermon sought to fertilize Kegaine

As he had a million brethren Spermons line won out over the others


Spermon inseminating Kegain before abandoning her
Neither Spermon nor Kegaine was virtuous, but they bore the greatest patriarch and the greatest matriarch

Horus the two-horned son of heaven, and Mahatma Maat the all-mother

Horus tired of living in the underworld under ice

So he challenged Hengweh for rulership of Terra

He demanded attention from all the Elohim for his coup

But alas they had little hope.

Amaterasu was so depressed she nearly dimmed out

Horus demanded to challenge Hengweh and eventually Hengweh agreed that he would let him be king for a week every 78 years if he beat him at any game of his choosing

In his wisdom and age Hengweh was a master of all the classic games

So Horus challenged him to a match of a new game, he challenged him to a match of Fortnite

Not knowing what Fortnite was Hengweh lost and so Horus won a leap week every 78 years

So every 78 years Horus would spend a week warming the planet, and soon some of the people under the ice could see the sky, and photosynthesis returned for a week every 78 years

Hengweh saw this with dismay, so he offered Horus a bet, he could get 13 more weeks per cycle if he won a game, and would lose his week if he lost, and Hengweh would choose the game.

Horus accepted and the game was a scavenger hunt. Whoever found the oldest rock would win.

Horus first went to the Jack Hills in Australia for he thought of the Zircons there, but Hengweh ripped out the eye of Horus so he couldn’t see the Zircons

Hengweh cast his eye into space, but alas his eye reached Mithra


The eye of Horus
With the eye of Horus Mithra saw all. Mithra saw a much older stone, a meteor from the beginning of all time

Mithra sent the meteor to Horus and so Horus won 13 more weeks

So every six years Horus would have a week to warm the world, and every 78 years he had two weeks. This is why we have leap years.

With Mithra and Horus together tradition was revived. Mithra and Horus conspired together to bring order back to the world


Our money represents the duality of Horus on the right and Mithra on the left
In a brutal battle with Hengweh Horus finally defeated Hengweh, but Hengweh summoned Hillu

And Hillu-Hengweh sent a meteor to Terra

But Mithra took advantage of this. He directed the meteor to break the icy prison

The meteor struck Sudbury and Oxygenated the entire world

All we have to remind us of this era are the bands of Iron deep in the ground


Ancient Relics of the rule of Hengweh. It is from these rocks we get 60% of our iron
Horus and Mithra reinvigorated Amaterasu and ordered her to brighten. So the world became bright again and life thrived again

Hilluhengweh was banished to the hinterlands, but no matter how hard they tried Mithra and Horus couldn’t kill him

Horus built a great protective wall in the sky. A wall of ozone that protected life from radiation. A wall we maintain to this day

And so to this day Mithra continues to vigorously maintain his institutions with each new generation, he shall never lose another election

So on this day in the year 12 billion and 151 million the Medieval Age of Terra began.

Some call this era the Boring Billion, but it was a time of great advancement and hardly boring at all.

To this day we go on pilgrimages to Sudbury Ontario to celebrate the deeds of Horus


The protective Ozone layer Horus made for us
It was in this time that the great Supercontinent Columbia formed


Horus bore a son named Thoth, and his sister Mahatma Maat bore two daughters named Seshat and Sophia

Horus carefully methylated his son so he would learn the virtuous ways, but Mahatma Maat was careless, she only methylated Seshat well and not Sophia

Seshat married Thoth Nectarius son of Horus the double-horned

In her arrogance Sophia refused to find a husband. She believed she was beyond all criticism and bore a son on her own

Incubus was her son and he was a great demiurge


Incubus ancestor of the Euglena
Incubus built great nightmarish visions and worlds for all to see, but he thought they were beautiful

He had no guidance and no father, his traditions were corrupted and his methylation pointless.


Sons of Incubus causing African sleeping sickness
When Horus died Thoth and Incubus fought over his mantle.

When Thoth slept Incubus tried to steal his mantle


Incubus the Demiurge
Thoth was paralyzed but by force of will he clutched his father’s mantle so hard Incubus couldn’t steal it

And to this day the sons of Incubus and Succubus enter our nightmares and give us sleeping sickness and Chagas disease and Elephantitis. But they can never steal the mantle of our father Horus

Protist family tree

The marriage of Thoth and Seshat was a great one

Each gave their full genomes. And so their children were Tetraploid


Chromosome 3 breaks in two at the centromere with neocentromeres forming, making the couple a unique species

It is always hard to live with polyploid chromosomes. How can the centrioles figure out which scroll goes where when there are four identical ones not two?

So Thoth and Seshat found a solution

Chromosome 1 remained as is

Chromosome 1.5 split at the centromere

With no centromeres on either half the chromosomes received new ones.

Their enzymes created neocentromeres with new histones in the centers of the new scrolls 4 and 5

Telomerase created new Telomeres for the new scrolls

Chromosomes 2 and 3 remained intact

But chromosomes 2.5 and 3.5 accidentally crossed over


The mutations of scrolls 2.5 and 3.5
First a piece of 2.5 got lost and inserted in 3.5

Then the ends of them swapped between each other

And so 2.5 became 6 and 3.5 became 7

And so they went from Tetraploid to Diploid again and genetic stability was reobtained

With more chromosomes their house had more redundancy. Many inscriptions could change in one location but not another, and so new abilities could be gained without losing others

Thoth and Seshat begat Jimmu and Percolos and Jingu

Like his brethren Percolos was a shapeshifter. He changed from Amoeba to flagellate as he pleased and even to cyst when he need remain dormant


Percolos
Percolos never specialized and his children are few and far between

And so the sons of Percolos invade our brains in envy, they are the brain eating amoebae


Jimmu begat Nectarius and Luka

Luka begat Jakob and Tsukuba

Neither Jakob nor Tsukuba were intelligent or talented


To this day billions of years later their descendants are remembered for not being descended from Nectarius

Nectarius was a great one

Nectarius married Ambrosia daughter of Jingu and they bore twin boys Animus and Plantus and twin girls Opima and Cortica

Opima was a huntress and Cortica was a gatheress

Cortica and Plantus begat Plastidus and Hacroses and Cryptina

Plastidus married Chlora the Cyanobacteria, and so Chlora became the chloroplast like Eve became the Mitochondria


Plastidus and Chlora begat Glauca and Alges and Alga

Glauca took greatly after her mother.

Her chloroplasts bore dresses of Peptidoglycan Sequins, while neither Alges nor Alga had such dresses


Glauca adopted the traditions of her mother rather than those of her mother.

Glauca was a simple woman who had many daughters by herself. They spread across the world and grew great in numbers, for her daughters needed no husbands they had new daughters constantly. The daughters of Glauca are known for their strict traditions, but their numbers have declined in recent times.

In the age of the Proterozoic they were numerous for they cloned themselves without limitations

But they are rare today, for without sex they remained primitive

All the daughters of Glauca are clones today


A few daughters of Glauca
Alga stripped her chloroplast of her Peptidoglycan dress. She built a beautiful sophisticated network of solar panels in her chloroplast


Algas chloroplast
Alges and Alga married and begat Rhodes and Vert

Rhodes was the Patriarch of Red Algae and Vert the Matriarch of Green Algae

Each of them could use their plastids in many ways


Types of Plastids
Dormant Etioplasts that would become Chloroplasts with sunlight

That’s why potatoes turn green in the sun

By the power of Nightshade and Sunshine potatoes grow green and toxic


A green poisonous potato
Colorful Chromoplasts blessed by Lord Carotenus himself

They keep their Carotenoids between their membranes

And show themselves ripe for picking










Chromoplasts and Carotenoids in action
And there were the Leucoplasts. Granaries that store food for hard times

Amyloplasts store starchy grain for hard times. We farm grain ourselves to eat from the stores of Amyloplasts


Amyloplasts in action
Elaioplasts that store oily lard for hard times


Olive oil comes from Elaioplasts
And proteinoplasts that store protein for hard times


Proteinoplasts give nuts protein
The sons of Rhodes were very numerous and quickly spread across the entire world. Their pigments were superior so they absorbed more light than the daughters of Vert


Accessory Pigments of Rhodes
While Plastidus was the ancestor of Plants, Hacroses was the ancestor of a great many others

Hacroses begat Haroses and Haptistus

Haroses bore three sons: Heterokon and Alveolus and Rhizar


The many members of the house of Haroses
Heterokon bore three sons: Ochros and Oomy and Bigyres

Bigyra
Oomy
Ochros found a daughter of Rhodes named Rosa, he stole her and married her


The endosymbiosis of Rosie
Ochros kept her in his house and she became the chloroplast of his lineage

Ochros bore countless children who are much of algae today, Diana the Beautiful, Kelpus the Giant, and Synura the fragrant, and Chrysanthema

Daughters of Diana
Daughters of Synura
Daughters of Chrysanthema
Sons of Kelpus


Kelpus built great cities with millions of farmers. They became the great Kelp forests of the seas.

Diana married Silicon and so her daughters built great shells of silicon for themselves. Nobody mastered silicon as well as her until Silicon Valley

The Diatoms create great fertile sands, Diatomaceous Earth


Bodélé Depression
When the great ancient lake of chad dried up the Diatoms formed great fertile sand. Every year Azoth carries the sand across the Atlantic to the Amazon Rainforest


Many were jealous of the successes of Ochros

Among them Alveolus the younger, son of Alveolus the Elder, cousin of Ochros

Alveolus the younger stole Okra daughter of Ochros, and so his line gained the power of the sun as well

But many were not so lucky

Rhizar, Oomy brother of Ochros, Haptos son of Haptistus, and Cryptos son of Cryptista formed a pact

They formed the Solar Coalition, to take the power of the son for them all

Cryptos was quickly successful, with a jetpack of his own blood he fled the union


Cryptos, his ejectosome is his jetpack

Our Chromosomes that inherit from Mardöll’s Nucleolus
“I have two of each scroll, which one shall I read from”

Dipla said “Why not read from both? If one is wrong you will have protection”

And so each read from each of their scrolls

They saw some passages differed.

Zygos saw that the scrolls he inherited from Golgi had instructions to build the endoplasmic Reticulum and an Apparatus like Golgi’s

Zygos couldn’t find these in the scrolls from his mother

But within the scrolls of his mother he found instructions for a more powerful flagella and a vault of Ribose

Dipla looked at her scrolls and found the same, but no Vault of Ribose

Dipla said to Zygos “Let us bear children so they may all have Vaults”

Zygos saw the scrolls were fraying. He said to Dipla “Wait we must repair our scrolls lest they be damaged as we know each other”

And so they built robots to tend to their books. Telomerase, the original book scorpions.

Telomerase wrote the ancient inscription of youth on either side of each scroll

TTAGGG

And so we meditate with the mantra TTAGGG to gain eternal youth and renewal

And so by viruses Zygos impregnated Dipla

And he bore her Quattro and Tetra

And so this generation was Tetraploid.

Each bore children asexually and their Chromosomes merged

A chromosome of Shiva merged with a Chromosome of Mardoll in each lineage

So each lineage bore three pairs of scrolls and a mitochondrial scroll


From Left to Right Chromosomes 1, 2, and 3
Chromosome 1 came from Mardoll entirely. It coded many of the most important things, and from it came the nucleolus


Chromosome 2 being formed by a chromosomal merger
The longest scroll was chromosome 2. It was a fusion of two extra copies of chromosomes 1 and 3. Not everything worked right but it contained the vault, and backup copies of most genes on the first and third scrolls

Chromosome 3 was the shortest scroll, for it only had the genes of Shiva. Chromosome 3 had instructions for Mitosis, the nucleus, and the Endoplasmic Reticulum.

After ten asexual generations there was a gamma ray burst and many sons of Quattro and daughters of Tetra found themselves mutants

In fear they decided they needed marriage to ensure diversity and preserve their scrolls

Many increased their copies to unsustainable levels. Cento had 100 copies of each chromosome and was so overwhelmed reading he did nothing else

Meios and Maia saw the plight of Cento and knew not to follow him. So they decided their children would each get half of their genes, not all of them.

Both were tenth generation descendants of Quattro and Tetra

They followed these steps together


They dissolved their nuclei and began mitosis

First they looked at their scrolls and Maia had an idea. She said each of them should cross over their scrolls to spread their data further




And so they crossed their scrolls over


After crossing over they lined up their scrolls in the middle


Their centrioles attached to each chromosome, but this time each pulled a single copy to their side, rather than both


And each of them split in two cells like it had been Mitosis

Each cell had three scrolls, but they saw they were already partially duplicated

If they merged these cells there would still be too many scrolls

So each cell split again




Each of the four sons of Meios merged their membrane with a daughter of Maia

And so each received their Mitochondria from Maia, three chromosomes from Meios and three chromosomes from Maia

So were Primus, Segunda, Trito, and Tetra

Primus died young, for his Golgi Apparatus didn’t form.

Meios and Maia were horrified. They cried out to Mithra “Why did Primus die”

Mithra said unto them “Read his scrolls and read the scrolls of his siblings”

And so Meios read the scrolls of all his children. He saw that Primus had no instructions for the Golgi Apparatus

He saw Segunda and Tetra had a scroll with instructions and a scroll without

And he saw that Trito had two copies of instructions


Both Meios and Maia were carriers who bore this gene

Primos had two copies so he was affected by this horrific disease

Segunda and Tetra each were carriers too

And Trito bore no copies. But as they looked closely they saw one of his scrolls was missing centrioles. It seemed the gamma rays damaged that part.

So to this day we follow the tradition of Meios and Maia. We read through our own scrolls to ensure we pass no diseases to our offspring, if we are carriers we don’t marry carriers.

And as each generation brings new mutations, we avoid marrying close relatives for risk we are both carriers of an unknown disease

Trito married Segunda and Tetra

And so was born the Gene Pool where scrolls would be shared

Segunda did a calculation. She calculated the family of Meios could grow larger if they didn’t marry.


But Tetra pointed out that without sex good ideas would be limited to one line

Two lines with good genes might annihilate each other instead of merging


Clonal interference, the biological concept Tetra referenced
Then Trito pointed out he became a carrier of a new disease from radiation, he didn’t know what it was but it looked bad. So with sex he could pass on his other genes and let that gene die out

And so they decided they would continue the tradition into eternity

But they missed some mutations: Segunda bore a damaged mitochondria, and Tetra bore a thirty-fold CAG repeat

And so within Tetra there was a Polyglutamine tower growing

The Trinucleotide curse




Trito and Tetra knew each other and they synthesized Twazina, Huntington, Tycho, Fortuna, and Aneta

The scribes had trouble with the long repetitive sequence, so those who inherited it had it grow longer


CAG repeat expansion
Twazina had thirty repeats, Huntington 50, Tycho and Fortuna had none, and Aneta had 75


Huntington was a great hunter. He lived life passionately, but when he was young he developed problems.

His arms moved erratically, but he compensated for it. He had trouble sleeping and planning his life, but he prayed to Mithra for help.

His disease became known as Huntington’s disease. Soon after his mother started showing symptoms too. It was dominant and grew in severity with each generation.

In the underworld Huntington watches over the disabled, inspires them to live great lives, and have children responsibly. One day he will help us use gene therapy to liberate us from genetic diseases once and for all. He also protects the disabled from eugenics and those who seek to victimize them

With Segunda Trito begat Vahide and Bruno and Darja and Miroslava

All her children inherited the curse of Segunda


Bruno married Twazina. They disobeyed the will of their parents.

They bore 40 children together and all inherited two copies of the disease of Trito. All their 40 children died in infancy. This is the curse bestowed upon those who ignore his commandment.

The world of heredity is a cruel one, but by staying righteous in their marriages Eziz and Oenone were liberated

Eziz son of Hugo son of Huntington was free of Huntington’s disease by luck and avoiding incest, but he carried the curse of Segunda

As he was a man he couldn’t pass down her curse, so he married Oenone who lacked the curse

Oenone’s father bore the curse himself, but her mother didn’t, so Oenone escaped the curse

Oenone daughter of Celinda daughter of Fortuna daughter of Tetra had the mitochondria of Tetra, so she was pure and healthy

Eziz and Oenone married and became the ancestors of all Eukaryotes. We must thank them for liberating us from their genetic curses

To this day we pray to Eziz and Oenone for guidance in having healthy children</text>

Chromosome 3 was the shortest scroll, for it only had the genes of Shiva. Chromosome 3 had instructions for Mitosis, the nucleus, and the Endoplasmic Reticulum.

After ten asexual generations there was a gamma ray burst and many sons of Quattro and daughters of Tetra found themselves mutants

In fear they decided they needed marriage to ensure diversity and preserve their scrolls

Many increased their copies to unsustainable levels. Cento had 100 copies of each chromosome and was so overwhelmed reading he did nothing else

Meios and Maia saw the plight of Cento and knew not to follow him. So they decided their children would each get half of their genes, not all of them.

Both were tenth generation descendants of Quattro and Tetra

They followed these steps together


They dissolved their nuclei and began mitosis

First they looked at their scrolls and Maia had an idea. She said each of them should cross over their scrolls to spread their data further




And so they crossed their scrolls over


After crossing over they lined up their scrolls in the middle


Their centrioles attached to each chromosome, but this time each pulled a single copy to their side, rather than both


And each of them split in two cells like it had been Mitosis

Each cell had three scrolls, but they saw they were already partially duplicated

If they merged these cells there would still be too many scrolls

So each cell split again




Each of the four sons of Meios merged their membrane with a daughter of Maia

And so each received their Mitochondria from Maia, three chromosomes from Meios and three chromosomes from Maia

So were Primus, Segunda, Trito, and Tetra

Primus died young, for his Golgi Apparatus didn’t form.

Meios and Maia were horrified. They cried out to Mithra “Why did Primus die”

Mithra said unto them “Read his scrolls and read the scrolls of his siblings”

And so Meios read the scrolls of all his children. He saw that Primus had no instructions for the Golgi Apparatus

He saw Segunda and Tetra had a scroll with instructions and a scroll without

And he saw that Trito had two copies of instructions


Both Meios and Maia were carriers who bore this gene

Primos had two copies so he was affected by this horrific disease

Segunda and Tetra each were carriers too

And Trito bore no copies. But as they looked closely they saw one of his scrolls was missing centrioles. It seemed the gamma rays damaged that part.

So to this day we follow the tradition of Meios and Maia. We read through our own scrolls to ensure we pass no diseases to our offspring, if we are carriers we don’t marry carriers.

And as each generation brings new mutations, we avoid marrying close relatives for risk we are both carriers of an unknown disease

Trito married Segunda and Tetra

And so was born the Gene Pool where scrolls would be shared

Segunda did a calculation. She calculated the family of Meios could grow larger if they didn’t marry.


But Tetra pointed out that without sex good ideas would be limited to one line

Two lines with good genes might annihilate each other instead of merging


Clonal interference, the biological concept Tetra referenced
Then Trito pointed out he became a carrier of a new disease from radiation, he didn’t know what it was but it looked bad. So with sex he could pass on his other genes and let that gene die out

And so they decided they would continue the tradition into eternity

But they missed some mutations: Segunda bore a damaged mitochondria, and Tetra bore a thirty-fold CAG repeat

And so within Tetra there was a Polyglutamine tower growing

The Trinucleotide curse




Trito and Tetra knew each other and they synthesized Twazina, Huntington, Tycho, Fortuna, and Aneta

The scribes had trouble with the long repetitive sequence, so those who inherited it had it grow longer


CAG repeat expansion
Twazina had thirty repeats, Huntington 50, Tycho and Fortuna had none, and Aneta had 75


Huntington was a great hunter. He lived life passionately, but when he was young he developed problems.

His arms moved erratically, but he compensated for it. He had trouble sleeping and planning his life, but he prayed to Mithra for help.

His disease became known as Huntington’s disease. Soon after his mother started showing symptoms too. It was dominant and grew in severity with each generation.

In the underworld Huntington watches over the disabled, inspires them to live great lives, and have children responsibly. One day he will help us use gene therapy to liberate us from genetic diseases once and for all. He also protects the disabled from eugenics and those who seek to victimize them

With Segunda Trito begat Vahide and Bruno and Darja and Miroslava

All her children inherited the curse of Segunda


Bruno married Twazina. They disobeyed the will of their parents.

They bore 40 children together and all inherited two copies of the disease of Trito. All their 40 children died in infancy. This is the curse bestowed upon those who ignore his commandment.

The world of heredity is a cruel one, but by staying righteous in their marriages Eziz and Oenone were liberated

Eziz son of Hugo son of Huntington was free of Huntington’s disease by luck and avoiding incest, but he carried the curse of Segunda

As he was a man he couldn’t pass down her curse, so he married Oenone who lacked the curse

Oenone’s father bore the curse himself, but her mother didn’t, so Oenone escaped the curse

Oenone daughter of Celinda daughter of Fortuna daughter of Tetra had the mitochondria of Tetra, so she was pure and healthy

Eziz and Oenone married and became the ancestors of all Eukaryotes. We must thank them for liberating us from their genetic curses

To this day we pray to Eziz and Oenone for guidance in having healthy children</text>

Our Chromosomes that inherit from Mardöll’s Nucleolus
“I have two of each scroll, which one shall I read from”

Dipla said “Why not read from both? If one is wrong you will have protection”

And so each read from each of their scrolls
[[Category:Pre-Outage Pages]]
They saw some passages differed.

Zygos saw that the scrolls he inherited from Golgi had instructions to build the endoplasmic Reticulum and an Apparatus like Golgi’s[[Category:Old Gaiad]]

Zygos couldn’t find these in the scrolls from his mother

But within the scrolls of his mother he found instructions for a more powerful flagella and a vault of Ribose

Dipla looked at her scrolls and found the same, but no Vault of Ribose

Dipla said to Zygos “Let us bear children so they may all have Vaults”

Zygos saw the scrolls were fraying. He said to Dipla “Wait we must repair our scrolls lest they be damaged as we know each other”

And so they built robots to tend to their books. Telomerase, the original book scorpions.

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tibolium_castaneum_TERT_structure.png
Telomerase wrote the ancient inscription of youth on either side of each scroll

TTAGGG

And so we meditate with the mantra TTAGGG to gain eternal youth and renewal

And so by viruses Zygos impregnated Dipla

And he bore her Quattro and Tetra

And so this generation was Tetraploid.

Each bore children asexually and their Chromosomes merged

A chromosome of Shiva merged with a Chromosome of Mardoll in each lineage

So each lineage bore three pairs of scrolls and a mitochondrial scroll


From Left to Right Chromosomes 1, 2, and 3
Chromosome 1 came from Mardoll entirely. It coded many of the most important things, and from it came the nucleolus


Chromosome 2 being formed by a chromosomal merger
The longest scroll was chromosome 2. It was a fusion of two extra copies of chromosomes 1 and 3. Not everything worked right but it contained the vault, and backup copies of most genes on the first and third scrolls

The daughters of Saya had brought the world near death

Their excessive O2 emissions were toxic

And so the air caught fire and there was no methane

Countless maidens died in the firestorm and suffocated in oxygen

And after that there was no methane greenhouse to heat the Earth

All the oceans froze over and it looked like life would die


A documentary on the world before Saya and how she disrupted it
The Great Tectonic Maiden Kenora, daughter of Terra, sister of Gaiadora was born

Her vastness covered the frozen sea

And she split into many


History of the Tectonic Maidens
As Lucas grew old he realized he had no sons, but he needed a successor, so he adopted Shiva and Poxau

Each wished to be firstborn

Lucas saw evil in Poxau’s heart so he gave his birthright to Shiva


Diagram of Shiva before his marriage
Shiva married Mardöll the Archea

Shiva merged his envelope with the her membrane and came to live inside her, he came to care for her, and blest her with his own proteins.

Poxau was jealous, so he vowed to destroy the sons of Shiva. He vowed vengeance upon the sons of Shiva

And so the sons of Poxau are a Pox on our house. They gave us smallpox.

She wasn’t the happiest with their marriage, so he didn’t break all his walls down.

Shiva kept his two membranes around his DNA, he built great channels through his two membrane so his messenger RNA could reach Mardöll’s ribosomes

And so he remained in her house and they lived together.


Shiva Lingam
Shiva Nabhika
Shiva Nataraja
They had a great life together, but they wanted children. They vowed to the first Mitosis

They replicated their genes: Shiva in his nucleus and Mardöll in her nucleoid


DNA replication – Image Credit: Designua / Shutterstock
Together they built a great machine: The Centriole that would move their genes and everything else around their cells


Centriole Replication
They created little robots named Kinis that walked on their tethers carrying everything around the cell


A kini walking
Each condensed into chromatin, and Mardöll dismantled her ribosome factory. So began the first prophase.


Shiva took a leap of faith and broke down his nucleus into little vesicles

And so began the first Prometaphase


In the center they lined up their scrolls

Mother and father each had great Chromatic Scrolls. Bound together in pairs, two copies written by the greatest of scribes linked together by centromeres


Great Chromatic Scrolls
Twas the first Metaphase


Then their Kinis pulled each of their copies to either side of the cell

Each cell had two chromosomes: one of Shiva and one of Mardöll

Two great scrolls of wisdom from father and mother

Twas the first Anaphase


Then the pieces of the nucleus reformed around each set

Anaphase began

Two Nuclei each with Two Chromosomes

Within each Nucleus was the scroll of Shiva and the scroll of Mardöll

Together they split in the first Mitosis, and so were born Euka and Parka

Their membrane split together on both sides in Cytokinesis

Both Euka and Parka unrolled their Chromatic scrolls

And so the first Mitosis was concluded



Full Cell Cycle Image
As Euka unrolled his scrolls he built a factory on the scroll of Mardöll, his Nucleolus.

He built a complex system of gates so his messengers could carry their scrolls of RNA to his workers in the Ribosomes outside


Parka became the strangest organism, neither Eukaryote nor Prokaryote. Today his sons live in the volcano Myōjin-shō near Okinawa


Parakaryon myojinensis
Euka met Eve and Lilith.

Euka and Lilith came together to stay warm from the cold.

Euka welcomed Lilith to his house

But soon Hengweh tempted Lilith to become selfish. As she learned more from him she grew crueler. 

So Euka expelled her from his household

And welcomed her sister Eve in her stead

And so Mithra married Euka to Eve and blessed their marriage.

Eve became the mitochondria and Euka became the nucleus and their union established the great tradition of marriage.


The Mitochondria
Lilith was angry and the daughters of Lilith continue to attack the descendants of Euka and Eve to this day.

Among the daughters of Lilith are Midichloria who regretted the evils of her ancestress, Rickettsia who takes greatly after her matriarch, and Wolbachia the Elah of domestic abusers.

Midichloria became the ancestress of the Midichlorians.


Wolbachia is the Elah of domestic abusers and simps. She forcibly marries men and castrates them.

Rickettsia has more vitriol than any of her sisters. She gives us many plagues

Typhus, Rickettsialpox, Boutonneuse fever, African tick-bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever, and Queensland tick typhus

Euka and Eve bore Reticulus and Flagella

Reticulus extended and formalized his nucleus

He formed a manufacturing network connected to his nucleus, between the inner membrane and the outer membrane


The extended nucleus of Reticulus
We call his network the Endoplasmic Reticulum

His network had two sections: the rough segment and the smooth segment

In his rough segment he studded the membrane with ribosomes so the peptide chains would enter the manufacturing chambers and fold there.

It was here he built his phospholipids and membrane proteins

He transported them with vesicles all over his house

In the smooth segment he stored ions and created cholesterols. Estrogen and Testosterone, as well as Lipoproteins.


Endoplasmic Reticulum in Center with Golgi’s Apparatus to the left
Reticulus bore Golgi

Golgi built an apparatus. He budded many vesicles from his endoplasmic reticulum and formed them into a processing center of its own.

Golgi created a complex apparatus for making vesicles, the Golgi Apparatus


Golgi’s Apparatus
Flagella improved her own Flagella

With joints and centriolar muscles instead of mere rotation

Flagellar muscles from the inside



Flagella begat Vaultess and Hauyam

Vaultess created a mysterious vault


The mysterious vault
Golgi revived the tradition of his great grandfather. And so he shed viral particles.

His viral particles were the first sperm


The original sperm of Golgi
And the sperm of Golgi merged with Vaultess and Hauyam



And so Vaultess became Zygos and Hauyam became Dipla

Zygos son of Golgi and Dipla daughter of Hauyam both had two copies of each scroll.

They were the first diploid cells

Then the pieces of the nucleus reformed around each set

Anaphase began

Two Nuclei each with Two Chromosomes

Within each Nucleus was the scroll of Shiva and the scroll of Mardöll

Together they split in the first Mitosis, and so were born Euka and Parka

Their membrane split together on both sides in Cytokinesis

Both Euka and Parka unrolled their Chromatic scrolls

And so the first Mitosis was concluded



Full Cell Cycle Image
As Euka unrolled his scrolls he built a factory on the scroll of Mardöll, his Nucleolus.

He built a complex system of gates so his messengers could carry their scrolls of RNA to his workers in the Ribosomes outside


Parka became the strangest organism, neither Eukaryote nor Prokaryote. Today his sons live in the volcano Myōjin-shō near Okinawa


Parakaryon myojinensis
Euka met Eve and Lilith.

Euka and Lilith came together to stay warm from the cold.

Euka welcomed Lilith to his house

But soon Hengweh tempted Lilith to become selfish. As she learned more from him she grew crueler. 

So Euka expelled her from his household

And welcomed her sister Eve in her stead

And so Mithra married Euka to Eve and blessed their marriage.

Eve became the mitochondria and Euka became the nucleus and their union established the great tradition of marriage.


The Mitochondria
Lilith was angry and the daughters of Lilith continue to attack the descendants of Euka and Eve to this day.

Among the daughters of Lilith are Midichloria who regretted the evils of her ancestress, Rickettsia who takes greatly after her matriarch, and Wolbachia the Elah of domestic abusers.

Midichloria became the ancestress of the Midichlorians.


Wolbachia is the Elah of domestic abusers and simps. She forcibly marries men and castrates them.

Rickettsia has more vitriol than any of her sisters. She gives us many plagues

Typhus, Rickettsialpox, Boutonneuse fever, African tick-bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever, and Queensland tick typhus

Euka and Eve bore Reticulus and Flagella

Reticulus extended and formalized his nucleus

He formed a manufacturing network connected to his nucleus, between the inner membrane and the outer membrane


The extended nucleus of Reticulus
We call his network the Endoplasmic Reticulum

His network had two sections: the rough segment and the smooth segment

In his rough segment he studded the membrane with ribosomes so the peptide chains would enter the manufacturing chambers and fold there.

It was here he built his phospholipids and membrane proteins

He transported them with vesicles all over his house

In the smooth segment he stored ions and created cholesterols. Estrogen and Testosterone, as well as Lipoproteins.


Endoplasmic Reticulum in Center with Golgi’s Apparatus to the left
Reticulus bore Golgi

Golgi built an apparatus. He budded many vesicles from his endoplasmic reticulum and formed them into a processing center of its own.

Golgi created a complex apparatus for making vesicles, the Golgi Apparatus


Golgi’s Apparatus
Flagella improved her own Flagella

With joints and centriolar muscles instead of mere rotation

Flagellar muscles from the inside



Flagella begat Vaultess and Hauyam

Vaultess created a mysterious vault


The mysterious vault
Golgi revived the tradition of his great grandfather. And so he shed viral particles.

His viral particles were the first sperm


The original sperm of Golgi
And the sperm of Golgi merged with Vaultess and Hauyam



And so Vaultess became Zygos and Hauyam became Dipla

Zygos son of Golgi and Dipla daughter of Hauyam both had two copies of each scroll.

They were the first diploid cells

With two scrolls to guide them</text>

Lucas was LUCA the Last Universal Common Ancestor


An artistic depiction of the relationship between us and Lucas and Freyja


Lucas and Freyja begat two daughters: Archa and Bacta, and no sons

Archa begat Sekhmet and Dipana

Dipana had many daughters who live in all eight corners of the world

Sekhmet became the mother of Taka and Yuri Archea

Yuri Archea bore three daughters: Methana Halo and Pyra

Methana, concubine of Methanius lived by making methane

Halo the Purple was a great seductress who got what she wanted from all.

She seduced Salta, Amaterasu, and Lord Carotenus

She is a deep purple and used the color of Carotenus to farm

She was the first farmer

Before Halo the daughters of Bios had only the nuclear energy below, from Uranius and Thorius, the energy from below. Halo could take energy from above, from Sol. So from this covenant came much more energy.

Her daughters live in the saltiest places in the world


Pyra concubine of Wolfstina was the mother of the Thermococci and Pyrococci

By the power of Tungsten her daughters live in the hottest lands on Earth


Taka begat Thauma Aiga Crenarche and Korra

Crenarche begat Asgarda and Thermoproteia

And Asgarda begat Heimdella, Tara, Odina, and Loki

Bacta created for herself a great dress of peptides and glycides


The brilliant sequin dress of Bacta
Bacta bore four daughters: Selas, Fuso, Aquifex and Thermetta

Aquifex made her own water

Selas bore twin daughters: Terra and Hydra

Together they split the world between each other

Terra took the land, and Hydra took the water

Hydra bore many daughters, all negative

Protea Pavaca Facaba and Spirocha


The negativity of the daughters of Hydra
Pavaca bore four daughters Chlamydiana Verucca Plancta and Lenti

Chlamydiana, the parasite who gives us chlamydia. She is incapable of anything but seduction and parasitism, she is the Elah of Gold Diggers.

All women must fight her by getting tested regularly, for she hates the fertile and strives to deprive all women from motherhood


A pap smear showing Chlamydiana sabotaging a woman’s motherhood
Verucca, mother of Fumar the great seductress



Fumar seduced the seven brothers Lanthanus, Cerius, Praseodymius, and Neodymius were her favorites

Occasionally she laid with Samarius Europius and Gadolinus who she liked less







She took all their power indiscriminately and barely saw the difference between them. She lived a secluded life in volcanic vents.

Facaba bore three daughters

Fibra the helper of cows, who lives in the bellies of cows

Chlorobi the sulfuric farmer

She farmed with green and sulfur, she farmed with green as purple was already taken


The daughters of Chlobori are numerous in the Morning Glory Spring
Bacterede the probiotic, who lives in our stomachs and blesses our health

Spirocha was the ancestress of Syphilus

Protea was a seafaring shapeshifter. Her protean nature made her both masculine and feminine, so Homer thought of her as a man


Protea bore many daughters

Alef was very efficient, a hard worker, a nitrogen fixer

Beth was a brilliant shapeshifter

Gamella bore many daughters, among them Pseudomona

Diana was a huntress

Epsilon brought

Zeta lives in rivers and eats iron

Hydrogenia is a thermophile

Acidolitha eats Iron and Uranium. She helps us mine and is the Elah of Metallurgy

Olga is a maiden of great filaments

Alef begat Rika, Abeona, and Callia

Rika bore two daughters: Pelagia and Rachel

Pelagia lived in the sea and bore a billion daughters

Her daughters are the most organism in the world.

Every summer half of all cells are her daughters


This is a microscopic photo of a bacterium called Pelagibacter ubique, the most common bacterium in the ocean!
Rachel begat two daughters

Firstborn was Lilith and secondborn was Eve



Lilith and Eve
Abeona was a great devotee of Ferron, Cobalton, and Nichaela

She dedicated herself to studying the arcane arts of magnetism

So her daughters were known as the Magnetococci

We see them lined up all constantly praying while facing north

Abeona is the Elah of compasses and navigation

Callia bore Callisto and Riza and the purple twins Rhoda and Rosa

Callisto went on a diet and became very beautiful.


Callisto’s beauty
Callisto eats little and is greatly efficient. Every time she mitoses she splits in two different daughters. Imagine what we could do if we learned her secrets

Rhiza was a nitrogen fixer, a concubine of Azoth.

Molybdenus introduced her to Azoth

Rhiza loves Azoth, she swallows his spirit and powers the nitrogen cycle

Rhiza knew Azoth and he bore her many daughters.

The black sheep was Agra

Agra daughter of Rhiza discovered genetic engineering. She used it for evil but we can use it for good.

Agra manipulates the DNA of plants, so that she can give them tumors. She feeds on tumors

Who knows what she could do if we convinced her tribe to serve the expansion of life


Agra genetically engineering a carrot cell
Rhoda was a great devotee of Lord Carotenus. She colored herself pink in her devotion to him. She saw a tailed one and took him as her husband. She knew him and he bore her many children. When she falls in love with another woman she releases tailed ones to spread her knowledge. And so the great Knowledgeable Rhoda is the Elah of Lesbian motherhood.


She and her sister Rosa were two of the many purple farmers who used the power of Lord Carotenus to photosynthesize

Beth had many many children. The tribe of Beth is great and diverse.

Once they were a great farming nation. The daughters Rhodofera were innumerable farmers across the globe

They range from parasites to rock eaters

Gonorrhea Meningitis and Whooping Cough

They eat ammonia so nature can live

Gamella became the mother of Entera, Pseudomona, Chromata and Vibrinella

Pseudomona was a concubine of Azoth, and he bore her Azota

Entera had many daughters: Salmonella Ecolia Yersinia and Klebisella

Salmonella and Yersinia cause food poisoning and plague

Ecolia helps us with digestion but sometimes goes wrong

Klebisella was devoted to Azoth

She swallowed the power of Azoth and brought Nitrogen to the world.

Chromata was the ancestress of the purple sulfur bacteria. She used sulfur in her farming to help her absorb the love of Amaterasu

Vibrinella glowed brightly. Her daughters bring light to a world of darkness



The daughters of Vibrinella
Diana bore a daughter named Myxo, she was the queen of a great hunting tribe


The daughters of Myxo
Gaia daughter of Diana would eat metals and Uranium


Gaia
Desulfa daughter of Diana would marry two daughters of Sulfa: Sulfata daughter of Hausa and Brima daughter of Adonai. And so the daughters of Desulfa took to consuming the sulfates of the earth and producing hydrogen sulfide. And so the daughters of Desulfa live deep in the ground and dominate it as they please


All below the green is dominated by the daughters of Desulfa
The daughters of Epsilon lived first in hydrothermal vents, and later would live in the stomachs of animals

Among them was Campylo


Campylo
Terra was very positive and wore a thick dress of many sequins

Terra bore many brash daughters: Actina, Sedna, and Firmicutie

Prasina was negative but her sisters were positive

Sedna became the ancestress of the Hadobacteria

Actina was a great artisaness. She bore a million daughters. Her eldest granddaughter was Strepyomyce, creatrix of soil and antibiotics. Streptomyce is the Elah of healing, known as Nintinugga to the Babylonians she creates countless medicines for us. Two thirds of antibiotics are created by her



Dactinomycin and Streptomycin, antibiotics created by Strepto
Ancient Mesopotamian depiction
Modern art by Yigitkoroglu
Artistic depictions of Nintinugga
Actina’s second daughter was Mycoba, whose daughters give us Tuberculosis and Leprosy

Actina’s youngest daughter was Francesca concubine of Azoth

Firmicutie bore two daughters: Clostrida and Bacilla

Clostrida feared the wrath of Hausa, she bore many daughters among them: Tetania who causes Tetanus, Botoxe who causes Botulism, and Helia

Botoxe is the smith of Botox.

Botoxe offers to buy souls to give people back their youth for a time

Helia was the ancestress of the Heliobacteria. From her came a great purple farming nation.

Bacilla bore two daughters: Yogurie, and Bacillie, and Staphy

Yogurie became the Elah of Yogurt. Her daughters work hard today to produce Yogurt and guard it from spoiling. But among her daughters was the black sheep Steptococca who gives us strep throat and scarlet fever.


The Sacramental Yogurt of Yogurie
Bacillie was a great alchemist. Her daughter Subtilia creates antibiotics, and her daughter Anthracia

Staphy was the mother of pestilence


The world was purple from all the purple photosynthesizers.

Prasina was green to absorb the light they missed

She begat Chloroflexi and Saya

Chloroflexi’s farming was efficient and had no emissions

But Saya was greedy

As she farmed she released harmful O2 emissions

She disregarded those she hurt

Saya bore many daughters


Saya
As she flourished she released many harmful O2 emissions that threatened global cooling.


Banded iron rocks were formed by her O2 emissions rusting iron and periodic catastrophes where her tribe died create non iron bands
In unison The Elohim told her that she needed to reduce her O2 emissions or else the world would die out.

Her civilization grew but it had no control of itself. Everyone wanted to be the only one releasing O2 emissions so everyone tried to get everyone else to reduce their emissions while keeping their emssions high

Twas this time that Hengweh struck. With the power of Hillu Hilluhengweh beat Mithra in the election and became president of the Elohim

And so the Hilluhim let Saya continue her emissions

Soon the world froze over in a great Fimbulwinter

The entire world froze over and it seemed life had completely died. In this time Mars and Venus were more habitable than Terra

Once they were a great farming nation. The daughters Rhodofera were innumerable farmers across the globe

They range from parasites to rock eaters

Gonorrhea Meningitis and Whooping Cough

They eat ammonia so nature can live

Gamella became the mother of Entera, Pseudomona, Chromata and Vibrinella

Pseudomona was a concubine of Azoth, and he bore her Azota

Entera had many daughters: Salmonella Ecolia Yersinia and Klebisella

Salmonella and Yersinia cause food poisoning and plague

Ecolia helps us with digestion but sometimes goes wrong

Klebisella was devoted to Azoth

She swallowed the power of Azoth and brought Nitrogen to the world.

Chromata was the ancestress of the purple sulfur bacteria. She used sulfur in her farming to help her absorb the love of Amaterasu

Vibrinella glowed brightly. Her daughters bring light to a world of darkness



The daughters of Vibrinella
Diana bore a daughter named Myxo, she was the queen of a great hunting tribe


The daughters of Myxo
Gaia daughter of Diana would eat metals and Uranium


Gaia
Desulfa daughter of Diana would marry two daughters of Sulfa: Sulfata daughter of Hausa and Brima daughter of Adonai. And so the daughters of Desulfa took to consuming the sulfates of the earth and producing hydrogen sulfide. And so the daughters of Desulfa live deep in the ground and dominate it as they please


All below the green is dominated by the daughters of Desulfa
The daughters of Epsilon lived first in hydrothermal vents, and later would live in the stomachs of animals

Among them was Campylo


Campylo
Terra was very positive and wore a thick dress of many sequins

Terra bore many brash daughters: Actina, Sedna, and Firmicutie

Prasina was negative but her sisters were positive

Sedna became the ancestress of the Hadobacteria

Actina was a great artisaness. She bore a million daughters. Her eldest granddaughter was Strepyomyce, creatrix of soil and antibiotics. Streptomyce is the Elah of healing, known as Nintinugga to the Babylonians she creates countless medicines for us. Two thirds of antibiotics are created by her



Dactinomycin and Streptomycin, antibiotics created by Strepto

Artistic depictions of Nintinugga
Actina’s second daughter was Mycoba, whose daughters give us Tuberculosis and Leprosy

Actina’s youngest daughter was Francesca concubine of Azoth

Firmicutie bore two daughters: Clostrida and Bacilla

Clostrida feared the wrath of Hausa, she bore many daughters among them: Tetania who causes Tetanus, Botoxe who causes Botulism, and Helia

Botoxe is the smith of Botox.

Botoxe offers to buy souls to give people back their youth for a time

Helia was the ancestress of the Heliobacteria. From her came a great purple farming nation.

Bacilla bore two daughters: Yogurie, and Bacillie, and Staphy

Yogurie became the Elah of Yogurt. Her daughters work hard today to produce Yogurt and guard it from spoiling. But among her daughters was the black sheep Steptococca who gives us strep throat and scarlet fever.


The Sacramental Yogurt of Yogurie
Bacillie was a great alchemist. Her daughter Subtilia creates antibiotics, and her daughter Anthracia

Staphy was the mother of pestilence


The world was purple from all the purple photosynthesizers.

Prasina was green to absorb the light they missed

She begat Chloroflexi and Saya

Chloroflexi’s farming was efficient and had no emissions

But Saya was greedy

As she farmed she released harmful O2 emissions

She disregarded those she hurt

Saya bore many daughters


Saya
As she flourished she released many harmful O2 emissions that threatened global cooling.


Banded iron rocks were formed by her O2 emissions rusting iron and periodic catastrophes where her tribe died create non iron bands
In unison The Elohim told her that she needed to reduce her O2 emissions or else the world would die out.

Her civilization grew but it had no control of itself. Everyone wanted to be the only one releasing O2 emissions so everyone tried to get everyone else to reduce their emissions while keeping their emssions high

Twas this time that Hengweh struck. With the power of Hillu Hilluhengweh beat Mithra in the election and became president of the Elohim

And so the Hilluhim let Saya continue her emissions

Soon the world froze over in a great Fimbulwinter

The entire world froze over and it seemed life had completely died. In this time Mars and Venus were more habitable than Terra

The sons of ambulus lived as fishermen. They started much like the sons of Chordatus.

Hemichus son of Ambulus built for himself a great proboscis. He became the father of the Hemichordates for his cord was only half and his brain was only half


Hemichus bore two sons: Acorn and Oak

Acorn lived as a worm, and Oak lived as a tree


Acorn
Oak bore two sons: Biscarpon and Pterobronk

Biscarpon
Pterobronk
Twin Brothers
Pterobronk became the ancestor of the graptolites and the pterobranches

Pterobranches
Graptolites
Biscarpon built for himself a skeleton of Limestone


Biscarpon bore two sons: Ctenocyston and Cincton

Ctenocyston crawled the seafloor while Cincton pumped water through his gill slits and fished that way, protected by his armor

Ctenocyston
Modern reconstruction of Cincton
Cincton begat Soluton who extended a single arm out with inflatable tubes to catch fish in the water, his left side taking over and his right side shriveling up

Soluton begat Helicoplacus whose arms multiplied by three

And so Helicoplacus bore no bilateral symmettry, his symmettry was triradial


Soluton and Helicoplacus
Helicoplacus took upon himself a form never seen before in his lineage


Helicoplacus
Helicoplacus begat Pentus and Pentus married Adria-Esther

Together they built a five sides city low on the rocks


The sons of Pentus were great and numerous


Pentus begat Stromatos

Stromatos begat Lepidos who extented his ambulacra as arms once again

Lepidos begat Felbabka

and Felbabka begat Echidna the stalked one with spiny skin

Echidna was the mother of the Echinoderms. Her daughters were great sea lilies that dominated the seas. Invulnerable to attack their floating flowery cities dominated the seas


Their great cities are now only ruins but in times past they were the greatest of their time</text>

Silur shouted out to all the sons of Animus

I did not steal the crown. I found it lying in the gutter, and I picked it up with the sword. But it was the people who placed it on my head.

And so began the Silurian era

Silur bore two sons: Eurypter and Chasmas


Chasmas
Chasmas begat Belangkas and Xiphos

Xiphos became the ancestor of Horseshoe crabs

Belangkas climbed up onto the land, taking land from Hirnan. Like Myriapus before he suffocated on the land, but pierced wounds into his sides and was relieved


Xiphos
Belangkas begat Soliber and Opiliona

Opiliona spread moss across the world and grazed of it and the daughters of Millipa

Opiliona was a great farmer and a great mother with beautiful legs longer than all others, and so she gained the nicknames Granny long legs and Granny Harvest

And so in her honor we call her descendants Daddy Long Legs and Harvestmen


Opiliona, Granny Long Legs
Soliber begat Pneumaran and Kitzi

Pneumaran begat Solaran and Acares

Acares was a dwarf, and so he became ancestor of the mites, the little ones who live everywhere on the lands


Acares father of the Mites
Acares bore two sons: Sarco and Trombo

The sons of Sarco clean the world, they became the dust mites

Among the sons of Trombo some live peaceful lives but others are plagues upon the sons of Plantus and Animus alike, horrific parasites that stifle life


Among the peaceful sons of Trombo are the red velvet mites


The Story of Love
We can learn a great story of love from the Red Velvet Mites

Solaran begat Solifugon and Ricinulon

Solifugon father of the Wind Spiders
Ricinulon father of the Tick Spiders
Kitzi begat Byblos the Book Knight and Paras the small one

Byblos the Book Knight continues to defend books to this day. His sons are the Book Scorpions


Byblos the Book Knight
Paras begat Mesos and Holoxos

Mesos was a fierce but small hunter, hunting across the globe for prey to feed his gluttony


Mesos

Holoxos
Holoxos walked the earth, drinking the blood of his fallen kinsmen: sons of Arachnus and sons of Myriapus alike

He bore two sons: Thyrus and Ricinus

Thyrus continued the peaceful tradition, drinking only the blood of the fallen, while Ricinus turned to the dark side, he fed on the blood of the living

Ricinus drinks blood of living victims, injecting paralytic sweaty venom into their victims

Ricinus swelled up and inflated with the blood of the innocents

By Ricinus the blood of the scorned woman may taint our veins

When Lilith’s blood enters our veins we are poisoned with Typhus and Spotted fever

The Midichlorians live in the sons of Ricinus, and within their mitochondria, the greatest revenge of Lilith

And after the daughters of Lilith come the daughters of Malarius and Lyme and the rest of the sisters of pestilence


Ricinus father of ticks, engorged with the blood of the innocent

Eurypter married Pulmona

Each disagreed on what to name their tribe

Eurypterids or Arachnopulmonates

Eurypter and Pulmona bore Eurypteron and Styloner

Eurypteron
Styloner
Eurypteron and Styloner argued among each other

When their mother died they argued who would inherit the world

Eurypteron claimed the skies and Styloner claimed the lands

And so Eurypteron flew across his domain and Styloner walked


The flight of Eurypteron
Eurypteron begat Diploper and Eurypterus

Eurypterus was the most fertile of the sons of Silur, in each generation, his house grew myriad-fold


Eurypterus
Diploper begat Waeringos and Carcinos

Carcinos
Waeringos begat Humiller and Adelops


Adelops
Adelops was a small one with many children, many resilient children like bugs of the sea

Humiller married Pterra and together they bore a son

A slender fast yet sly son who they named Slimon


Slimon
Slimon bore a son with massive claws from his mouth

He named this son Clawbert

But as he did a strike of lightning arose

And Slimon took the omen and named his son Pterygo


Pterygo
The sons of Pterygo were the rules of the eurypterids. Fast strong and regal they ruled the world

His youngest son was Scorpio the explorer

Scorpio saw no more land for his taking, for all his older brothers claimed the world

And so Scorpio looked up out of the sea

Scorpio ventured up to land. His book gills became book lungs, and he claimed all the lands of Euramerica for himself

His sons are known today as the scorpions

Scorpio
A son of Scorpio
Styloner married Rhena and together they bore Makoko and Stylonurus


Stylonurus
Makoko begat Mycter and Kokomo

Mycter begat Flumon and Drepan

Flumon found no luck in the seas, for all his brothers and cousins claimed the seas for themselves, so he searched the rivers

Flumon begat Hibbert and Mycterops

Hibbert was a great tough riverdweller, larger and tougher than anyone else he survived countless tragedies

His people were resilient and powerful and ancient


Hibbert
Mycterops was strong and versatile, his two sons continued the tradition living in the rivers and searching for food in the most unlikely of places

Megarachne and Minirachne sons of Mycterops were the rulers of the rivers, but Minirachne was dissatisfied and wanted more

Eurypter married Pulmona[[Category:Old Gaiad]]

Each disagreed on what to name their tribe

Eurypterids or Arachnopulmonates

Eurypter and Pulmona bore Eurypteron and Styloner

Eurypteron
Styloner
Eurypteron and Styloner argued among each other

When their mother died they argued who would inherit the world

Eurypteron claimed the skies and Styloner claimed the lands

And so Eurypteron flew across his domain and Styloner walked


The flight of Eurypteron
Eurypteron begat Diploper and Eurypterus

Eurypterus was the most fertile of the sons of Silur, in each generation, his house grew myriad-fold


Eurypterus
Diploper begat Waeringos and Carcinos

Carcinos
Waeringos begat Humiller and Adelops


Adelops
Adelops was a small one with many children, many resilient children like bugs of the sea

Humiller married Pterra and together they bore a son

A slender fast yet sly son who they named Slimon


Slimon
Slimon bore a son with massive claws from his mouth

He named this son Clawbert

But as he did a strike of lightning arose

And Slimon took the omen and named his son Pterygo


Pterygo
The sons of Pterygo were the rules of the eurypterids. Fast strong and regal they ruled the world

His youngest son was Scorpio the explorer

Scorpio saw no more land for his taking, for all his older brothers claimed the world

And so Scorpio looked up out of the sea

Scorpio ventured up to land. His book gills became book lungs, and he claimed all the lands of Euramerica for himself

His sons are known today as the scorpions

Scorpio
A son of Scorpio
Styloner married Rhena and together they bore Makoko and Stylonurus


Stylonurus
Makoko begat Mycter and Kokomo

Mycter begat Flumon and Drepan

Flumon found no luck in the seas, for all his brothers and cousins claimed the seas for themselves, so he searched the rivers

Flumon begat Hibbert and Mycterops

Hibbert was a great tough riverdweller, larger and tougher than anyone else he survived countless tragedies

His people were resilient and powerful and ancient


Hibbert
Mycterops was strong and versatile, his two sons continued the tradition living in the rivers and searching for food in the most unlikely of places

Megarachne and Minirachne sons of Mycterops were the rulers of the rivers, but Minirachne was dissatisfied and wanted more

Megarachne
Minirachne
Scorpio and Minirachne were always destined to fight, for both had more ambition than any other men of their time

Minirachne climbed up with his wife Tetra into the new world, the world of land, his book lungs became book gills and he came to conquer the lands of Scorpio

Vater built a great channel uniting liver and pancreas into his belly, to this day we call this channel the Ampulla of Vater in his honor

Such an exalted father, father of many, that the Elohim called him Abraham

Vater bore two sons: Arandus and Hestracon


Arandus
Hestracon the great found his belly inadequate.

From mouth to anus all the same, with only his father’s ampulla in the middle

Hestracon built a chamber before his father’s ampulla and he called it his stomach

And so the stomach was the great divider, before the stomach laid the esophagus and after the stomach laid the intestine


An in depth diagram of the Ampulla of Vater and the stomach
Hestracon begat Astrops and Eteros


Astrops
Eteros begat Cyatha the cupshielded and Tsubasa the wingshielded


Cyatha the cupshielded
Tsubasa begat Thelos and Cephalus


Thelos
Thelos broke his armor into innumerable scales, and so he became flexible and lived in the reefs, where none others could bend well enough to reach, neither sons of Arthropus nor sons of Molluscus nor sons of Chordatus

Cephalus bore wings on each side of his helmet, his head flew and as he swam he found stability. His lateral line kept him ahead of the competition and aware of all his surroundings

Cephalus begat Galeas and Osteos


Osteos was in a conundrum, his bones were espensive, countless moles of calcium phosphorus and all other elements wasted, so he decided he would build his skeleton differently

Osteos built blood channels inside his bones, as living breathing stores of minerals

In abundance he built them up and in scarcity he borrowed from them, and so he grew more prosperous and stronger than all his relatives

Osteos bore two sons: Pituri and Ostracos

sons of Pituri
sons of Ostracos
Ostracos bore a million sons who multiplied everywhere

Pituri grew a great long snout

Pituri begat Beakon

Pituri’s mouth was only lips and no jaw. Could only close and never bite.

Beakon saw potential in his snout.

And so Beakon moved his gill arches into his mouth to catch food

Beakon’s son Gnathus saw more potential, he and his wife Pelaca hunted down trilobites and didn’t just catch them, they crushed trilobites and consumed their rich flesh, their armored jaws sliced through their meals bringing life-giving nourishment

And so Jaws were born and the world would never be the same again
