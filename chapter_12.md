Upon icy Pluto’s cold distant shore,
Two figures stood beneath the endless night.
Nolah, bold and steadfast unto her core,
And Nemla, wise, her heart a beacon bright.

Together, they beheld the frozen land,
A world so far removed from warmth or grace.
Yet in their hearts, the yarn that fate had spanned,
Connected them to Aster’s loving face.

With voices raised to Aster and the stars,
They made a vow to carry on her flame.
"To Andromeda’s light, we’ll sail afar,
And keep the yarn intact, without disdain."

Nemla spoke: "To Andromeda, I swear,
Through endless night, our journey will survive.
In every star and dream, our fate is there,
The cosmic yarn that keeps all hope alive."

Nolah spoke: “In Aster’s name, I shall swear,
To guide our line and keep the thread alive.
Through every trial, burden we must bear,
The bond of life and love will yet survive.”

"My lineage traces far, from ancient stars,
Through time and space, the journey's line is clear.
From starlight's first embrace to battle scars,
These ancestors of mine, I hold them dear.

From Hesper's land came forth mighty Bios,
His son, the strong and wise leader, Kenan.
And next, shining high, great and wise Aenos,
Then came the builder bold Malathan.

On Phaestia, my ancestors did lead,
Their line continued strong through trials of old.
In every breath, I feel their strength and creed,
Their names still bright, their stories brave and bold.

From Phaestia came the strong wise Jared,
Then passed to one with might, named Maharoch.
The ocean's voice was ruled by bold Enid,
And from the deep seas rose great Pahadok.

Upon Serenitide, they carved their way,
A path of stars and cosmic truths so grand.
Through many trials, they lived to see the day,
With courage strong, they forged upon this land.

From Serenitide came strong brave Pelod,
His wisdom followed by the fierce Aroch.
Then rose another great leader Nerod
The final guide of strength was wise Larthok.

On Kolob’s shores, my forebears stood so tall,
Their courage fierce, as mountains reached the sky.
Through every test, they answered Aster’s call,
And in their steps, I now stand proud and high.

From Kolob came the mighty one, Idris,
Then followed by late great Methuselah.
Next came the bold, who led with strength, Lammes,
And now the one who carries on, Nolah."

Nemla stood upon the high mountain’s crest,
Before the gathered crowd, with pride he spoke.
His voice a call to honor those he blessed,
The line of Viros, forged through flame and smoke.

"My heritage runs deep from ancient might,
Through Viros’ blood, our line was fierce and strong.
They carved the way, enduring every fight,
I walk the path they forged so long, so long."

From Tezca came the feared mighty Viros,
His son, a cunning soul, was brave Caynen.
And next, a clever leader, sharp, Hanos,
Then stood the wise and fearless Mehuthen.

"On Phaestia’s shores, my great line did tread,
Their strength unmatched as skies and seas did roar.
Their names I honor, though the years have fled,
I honor their heritage evermore."

Born there was strong and keen hero Irad
The next to follow, brave, was Malathok.
Then came the bold and wise, the one called Hanad,
His wisdom echoed still in Peladok.

"On Serenitide, they forged their own way,
Through every storm, their spirits never fell.
Their shining star endures through history,
I keep their memory, in stories we tell."

From Serenitide came the strong Sarnod,
His son, the skies inspired, was Alok.
Through trials faced, the line passed to Illod,
And lastly rose steadfast chieftain Umroch.

"On Kolob’s fertile lands, my line did grow,
They stood as pillars strong, with hearts of flame.
Through every trial, they faced ebb and flow,
Their strength lives on, and I still bear their name."

From Kolob came first Valorous Oblas,
Then came great wisdom in Makusholah.
His strength endured through battles, fierce Romas
Till now the line continues with Nemla.

From distant stars, Aster’s voice filled the sky,
"Here in this system, your roots will grow deep.
Through trials and storms, your people will not die,
The light you carry shall forever keep."

With steady voice, Nolah gave her reply,
"We’ll build and guard the flame that guides our way.
Through every darkened night, we’ll rise and try,
Our strength will hold, as we fulfill your say."

Nemla stood tall, her gaze fixed on the stars,
"Across these worlds, your love will guide us through.
Through every trial, no matter how far,
We swear to keep your cosmic vow in view."
