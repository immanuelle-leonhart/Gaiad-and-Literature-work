In [Aelaki](Aelaki) the collective is a level of plurality one step above the [plural](Aelaki plural). 

Collective is marked by a voicing of the last consonant if it is not a nasal, and the deletion of the last consonant if it is a nasal. 

If the noun ends with a vowel a -b is added to the end of it.

It is also marked by the fronting of all vowels, and the raising of the last vowel. 

It is not to be confused with the similarly appearing [form](habitual)(habitual form) of verbs which also involves voicing the last consonant, albeit for completely different historical reasons (it came from a phenomenon in old reduplication used to indicate pluractionality vs a new reduplication used for subject verb agreement).

The collective originally developed from the dual form suffix -bel but many phonetic changes caused it to eventually become completely non-concatenative.
