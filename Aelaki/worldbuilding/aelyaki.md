Aelaki is the language of the Kxakxa people

I am building it starting from year zero (2000 our calendar) and developing until year 5000

This will mainly cover linguistic history

The prefix uchi- (go) is often appended to words to make them more regular later in the history.

## Shifts in chronological order

# classifiers -> gender
# Evidentiality verb development and verb agreement
# SVO order frees up

## Earliest grammar
Used classifiers

Copula was irregular

## Irregular proto language copula
Ghi was standard copula

Gi was irregular copula

Originally yes or no sentences were asked in the english style

"Are you sick":

"You are sick"

Gi was the second person version

When word order began to free up Gi began to become a yes-no question particle

## Proto language
Used a system of classifiers like Japanese. 

Classifiers got fused in

Classifiers are still used but a lot less frequently
Genders

# i (child)
## -bi (child classifier)
# e (female)
## -d'e (woman classifier)
# ae (male)
## -aeki (old/male classifier)
## aek is a more common suffix, aeki is pretty rare

### Gender development example
eub bi -> eubi 

(child)

### Demonstrative development
dzhih bi ->dzhib

(this child) -> this (child)

dzhih d'e -> dzhed'

(this woman) -> this (female)

dzhih aeki -> dzhaek

(this man) -> this (male)

### Pronoun development

#### First person
zun bi -> zim

zun d'e -> zen

zun aeki -> zaeng

#### Second person
t'i bi -> t'ib

t'i d'e -> t'et

t'i aeki -> t'aek

#### Third person
she bi -> shib

she d'e -> shed'

she aeki -> shaek

#### Fourth person
fo bi -> fibi

fo d'e -> fed'e

fo aeki -> faek

### Pronoun plural forms

#### First person
zun bi bi -> zimbib 

zun d'ede -> zend'ed 

zun aekiki -> zaengkik -> zaengkaek

#### Second person
t'i bibi -> t'ibib 

t'i d'ede > t'etet 

t'i aekiki -> t'aekik -> t'aekaek

#### Third person
she bibi -> shibib -> 

she d'ede -> shed'ed -> 

she aekiki -> shaekik -> shaekaek

#### Fourth person
fo bi -> fifibi

fo d'e -> fefed'e

fo aeki -> faefaek

### Pronoun collective forms

#### First person
zun bel bi -> zimbil 

zun bel d'e -> zed'el 

zun bel aeki -> zaekel 

#### Second person
t'i bel bi -> t'ibil 

t'i bel d'e -> t'etel 

t'i bel aeki -> t'aekael 

#### Third person
she bel bi -> shibil 

she bel d'e -> shed'el -> shedel

she bel aeki -> shaekael  

#### Fourth person
fo bel bi -> fibil

fo bel d'e -> fed'el

fo bel aeki -> faekael

### Number development
originally base 8

first 8 numbers have highly obscure meanings

9 means new (pie reference)

10 b'el means two hands derived from earlier form b'ebel

11 m'akx means extra, one more than ten

12 wiv means rings. 

50 (60d) op'iv means complete 12, from the earlier point of base 60

100 (120d) bolop'iv means two sixties, from the earlier point of base 60

### Pluralization development
Pluralization has two forms

plural and collective

plural is determined by reduplication

-bel was originally a dual form, from the word bel meaning two

### Plural verbs
In the proto language reduplication of a verb indicated a frequentative form of the verb, but it got merged in with 

collective verbs developed from a dual form of the verb that analogously did that

### Copula development
Original copula is ghi derived from a word for "hold"

### Word order and verb agreement development
Initial word order was SVO, direct-inverse alignment

inverse marker na comes from a word meaning to stand still

person hierarchy

| + |
| Person |
|---|
| I (male) |
| I (female) |
| I (child) |
| You (male) |
| You (female) |
| You (child) |
| 3rd person male |
| 3rd person female |
| 3rd person child |
| 3rd person neuter |

### First person child
Zun bi bvae sugh -> Zim Bivae Sugh

I drink water 

Zun bi na bvae sugh -> Zimna Bivae Sugh

Water drinks me

(note that this formulation may be wrong if I decide to place second person higher in the hierarchy than first person)

Zun bi bha t'i aeki -> Zim Bibha T'aek -> Zimbibhat'aek -> Zibhat'ae

I see you

Zun bi na bha t'i aeki -> Zim Binabha T'aek -> Zinabhat'ae

You see me

### First person female
Zun d'e bvae sugh -> Zen Bevae Sugh

I drink water 

Zun d'e na bvae sugh -> Zena Bevae Sugh

Water drinks me

(note that this formulation may be wrong if I decide to place second person higher in the hierarchy than first person)

Zun d'e bha t'i aeki -> Zen Bibha T'aek -> Zimbibhat'aek -> Zibhat'ae

I see you

Zun d'e na bha t'i aeki -> Zena bha T'aek -> Zinabhat'ae

You see me

### First person male
Zun aeki bvae sugh -> Zaeng Baevae Sugh

I drink water 

Zun aeki na bvae sugh -> Zaengna Baevae Sugh

Water drinks me

(note that this formulation may be wrong if I decide to place second person higher in the hierarchy than first person)

## Sound shifts

# the great l shift
## l- -> l-
## -l- -> -ʎ- 
## -l -> -i

## Example shift
Sak -> Sak -> Sak -> Sak -> Sak

Sakel -> Sakei -> Saki -> Soki -> Sok

Saksak -> Sasak -> Sasak
