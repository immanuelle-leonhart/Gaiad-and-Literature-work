# **Allochy (Aelaki) Grammar Guide**

*Everything in this primer reflects the standard literary variety spoken in the capital region circa CE 1800.*  
 Pronunciation key: **Aelaki** /a.e.ˈla.ki/.

---

## **1 Overview**

Allochy is famous across Keth and beyond for **non‑concatenative morphology**—grammatical meaning is encoded by reshaping a triconsonantal (occasionally quadri‑) root rather than by stringing affixes. Three phonological operations lie at the heart of the system:

| Operation | Mnemonic name (Aelaki) | Form | Core meaning |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Base** | *bhinki‑* “root” | C₁V₁C₂V₂C₃ | singular / perfective‑incomplete / positive degree |
| **Reduplication** | *bhinkibhin* “two roots” | C₁V₁**C₂**C₂V₂C₃ | partitive plural / imperfective / comparative |
| **Umlaut** | *bhinkiæ* “final root” | C₁**front‑V₁**C₂**front‑V₂**C₃ | collective / perfective‑completed / superlative |
| **Zero‑infix** /ɸ/ | *bhinki‑f* “absent root” | C₁V₁**f**C₂V₂C₃ | negation / zero quantity |

**Important correction:** the zero‑/f/ infix **never** appears in the *yes/no* particles **Su/Fu** or their variants. It is restricted to content words and a handful of linking particles such as **zuf** “and … not”.

### **1.1 Cross‑category reach**

The four shapes apply productively to nouns, verbs, adjectives, numerals, many interjections, and even some conjunctions.

*Verb illustration*

* **Dapaz** “shot at (once, success not implied)”

* **Dapapaz** “shooting at (ongoing)”

* **Dæpæz** “shot (single hit achieved)”

* **Dapfaz** “did not shoot / no shots fired”

*Adjective illustration*

* **goran** “bright” → **gororan** “brighter” → **gœrœn** “brightest” → **gorfan** “not bright / dull”.

## **2 Small Words**

### **2.1 Affirmatives & negatives**

| Meaning | Base | Reduplicated (discursive) | Umlaut (final) | Redup + Umlaut (emphatic) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| yes | **Su** | **Susu** | **Si** | **Sisi** |
| no | **Fu** | **Fufu** | **Fi** | **Fifi** |

### **2.2 Connectives**

* **Zuzu** “and (list continues)”

* **Zu** “and (list ends, but non‑exhaustive)”

* **Zi** “and (exhaustive list)”

* **Zuf** “and **not**, excluding the following item(s)”

### **2.3 Switch reference & focus**

* **No** “switch to known referent”

* **Nono** “introduce new referent”

* **Ne** “merge previous and current referents”

* **Nof** “negate / except this referent”

Ne in particular is a widely used particle in speeches and politics. Since it implies a unification of multiple parties. 

## Questions

Questions generally rely on the question particle below

Shu \= what

Shushu \= discussion

Shi \= give a final answer

By default these indicate a simple question of “Is this clause true”

## General interrogative “Did”

Shabavadashro Roger Rabbit Shu

Did someone kill Roger Rabbit?

## Interrogative Zero marking (Who, what) 

However for questions related to nouns, the noun in question is marked as zero number, and alongside the question particle this transforms a sentence from a negative to a question

Shafbavadashro Roger Rabbit

"No man killed Roger Rabbit"

Shafbavadashro Roger Rabbit Shu

"Who killed Roger Rabbit"

This can be more specific such as 

Atufkunush Shafbavadashro Roger Rabbit Shu

What man killed Roger Rabbit

The zero number marks questions. And this can be applied to any part of the sentence. 

There is no animacy distinction that you can make that meaningfully differentiates who from what in a way analogous to english

## Where when and why

These are done with negated converbs reflecting these things. 

Okay finally working on adopsitions

# Adopositions

Snü \= At

Snüsnü \= Through

Snï \= Final location

Snüf \= Where?

Snüfsnüf \= Where through?

Snïf \= Where are they going?

Slë \= At a time

Slëslë \=  Throughout a duration of time

Slæ \= Completion time

Slëf \= What time?

Slëfslë \= What time period?

Slæf \= What time did it end?

## How

Done with a negation of the verb alongside the question particle

Different from the “Did” which involves no specification of methods. This assumes the thing happened and asks how.

Note that with evidentials it changes meaning slightly

It is most significant with the optative

How is this thing good?

And the deliberative

How am I questioning this?

## Deliberative mood

Deliberative mood \-yam refers to a future statement said with a question of whether it should happen

Thozharanyam \= Should I eat

Thozharanyam shushu \= explain why I should or should not eat

This is generally seen as a question. But a simple yes/no question. It is not used for more complex things

Question particle asks for answers more explicitly but is optional

### **2.4 Numerals (excerpt)**

| Semantic value | Base | Partitive (some of) | Collective (all) | Negative / zero |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2 | **Bal** | **Babal** | **Bæl** | **Bafal** ("–2" or “two absent”) |

---

## **Copula**

### Is of identity or class membership

Done with this irregular verb

Zon-(ki) means the connected nouns are identical

Zen-(ki) ends the list

Corbin Bleu Zonash Actor Zenash

Corbin Bleu is an actor

The \-(ki) at the end indicates what gender the group should be referred to by

### Predicative

Apples are tasty

Done with stative verbs

### Existential

Apples exist

Stative verb “Lake”

## **3 Gender System**

Allochy distinguishes **four grammatical genders**:

| Gender | Singular vowel | Collective vowel | Biological note |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Child | **u** | **i** | pre‑reproductive stage |
| Female | **o** | **e** | early reproductive stage |
| Male | **a** | **æ** | late reproductive stage |
| Inanimate | **ɪf** (written ‹ïf›) | **–** | non‑living / mass nouns |

Speakers are sequential hermaphrodites (child → female → male). Animate nouns normally track the actual life stage; in invertebrates and artefacts, gender is assigned by perceived **age** or **sound symbolism**.

*Inanimate peculiarities*

* Uncountable by default; **reduplication** marks paucity vs. plenty (rarely used).

* Cannot take the /f/ infix (already contains /f/).

* May not appear as the agent of dynamic verbs; speakers insert a **counter** bearing an animate gender when syntactically needed.

---

## **4 Floating “Ki” Syllables**

*So‑called because early grammarians glossed them as **kí** ‘word’.* About **50** such clitics encode **person, gender, and number** and attach to the right edge of the predicate (or to a focused constituent).

Example (child gender):

| Meaning | Form |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1sg | **Thu** |
| 1pl | **Thuthu** |
| 1pl inclusive | **Thi** |
| 1sg negated | **Thuf** |

Only **two** Ki express inanimate role:

* **ïf** “paucal inanimate subject/object”

* **ïfïf** “plentiful inanimate”.

## **Cases**

Aelaki has a system of five cases, all cases have ki syllables in them.

Aelaki has five cases. Here they are demonstrated with different persons for the noun Basol (tree, feminine, singular). Changes to number and gender strictly follow the “Ki” rules, and reduplication of the \-s- consonant, so they do not affect the presented case markings

| Case | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p | Inanimate | Evolution | Usage notes |  |  |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Agent | **Basoltho** | **Basoljo** | **Basolsho** | **Basolko** |  | **Epenthesis over “-oth tho-” constructs being hard to pronounce** | **Does not exist for inanimate nouns Subject of active verbs** |  |  |
| Patient | **Basoloth** | **Basoloj** | **Basolosh** | **Basol** | **Basïlïf** | **Evolved from earlier ergative case, least marked** | **Subject of stative verbs** |  |  |
| Possessive | **Basothol** | **Basojol** | **Basoshol** | **Basokol** | **Basïfïl** |  | **Usually dropped, alienable-inalienable distinction made with the prefix/infix on the possessed** |  |  |
| Instrumental | **Basolothko** | **Basolozhgo** | **Basoloshko** | **Basolokto** | **Basïlkïf** |  | **Also works as Comitative case or a Locative case** |  |  |
| Dative | **Basolthon** | **Basoljon** | **Basolshon** | **Basolkon** | **Basïlïfïn** |  | **Also works as Benefactive case. When the noun is in negative number it operates as an ablative, malefactive** |  |  |
| Speaker | **Basolthoro** | **Basoljoro** | **Basolshoro** | **Basolkoro** |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

If the verb agrees to the same thing multiple times there is a hierarchy of the following

Agent \> Dative \> Patient \> Instrumental \> Possessive \> Speaker

Speaker case should be indicated with the speaker auxiliary verb if it is overwritten with another one of these.

The Instrumental and Dative case are both highly context dependent and rely on inferences from the nature of the verb, or adverbs to determine their meaning

Speaker auxiliary verbs

|  |  | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Child** | Speaker aux | **Uthuro** | **Ujuro** | **Ushuro** | **Ukoro** |
|  | Speaker ironic | **Uthuthuro** | **Ujujuro** | **Ushushuro** | **Ukokoro** |
| **Female** | Speaker aux | **Othoro** | **Ojoro** | **Oshoro** | **Okoro** |
|  | Speaker ironic | **Othothoro** | **Ojojoro** | **Oshoshoro** | **Okokoro** |
| **Male** | Speaker aux | **Atharo** | **Ajaro** | **Asharo** | **Akaro** |
|  | Speaker ironic | **Athatharo** | **Ajajaro** | **Ashasharo** | **Akakaro** |

## **Agent**

Indicates the subject of a transitive verb, and the subject of an active verb

## **Patient**

Indicates the object of a transitive verb and the subject of a stative verb

## **Instrumental**

## **Dative**

## **Speaker**

Speaker case indicates the source for the information in a non-visual evidential. Speaker aux is an auxiliary verb that agrees with the speaker to allow for some information but dropping them. Speaker ironic indicates skepticism of the source of the information. Speaker aux always drops the speaker noun. Speaker ironic often accompanies the noun for emphasis.

## **Possession (Genitive Constructions)**

### **Overview**

Aelaki distinguishes **inalienable** and **alienable** possession. Both strategies are **head‑marking**: morphological material appears principally on the possessed noun, while the possessor NP is frequently omitted unless contrastive.

### **Inalienable Possession**

*Domains:* kin relations, body parts, part‑whole, inherent properties.

| Morphology | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Internal infix** | `C₁ + V(gender) + C(person) + …` inserts possessor’s gender vowel & person consonant right after the first root consonant. |
| **Suffix** | `‑ng` replaces the usual Ki person clitic on nouns. |

*Example*

**gar** “hand” → **ga‑o‑r‑ung** “my hand” (o \= child vowel, r \= 1SG consonant, ‑ng inalienable)

If the possessor NP is expressed it typically follows the noun:

**ga‑o‑r‑ung** **thu** “my hand (I)”

### **Alienable Possession**

*Domains:* transferable property, abstract relations, spatial/temporal genitives

| Morphology | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Prefix** | `V(gender) + C(person)‑` attaches before the noun. |
|  |  |

*Example*

**selo** “book” → **uthselo** “my book”

### **Comparative Summary**

| Genitive | Template | Typical use | 1SG example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Inalienable | `C₁ V(gen) C(person)…‑ng` | kin, body, inherent | **ga‑o‑r‑ung** “my hand” |
| Alienable | `V(gen) C(person)‑root‑n` | property, location, oblique | **o‑r‑selo‑n** “my book” |

### **Syntactic Notes**

* Ki on verbs agrees with the possessor only when that possessor functions as an argument (e.g., subject of a stative clause).  
* Dialects in the western highlands generalise the alienable prefix but keep **‑ng/‑n** to mark semantic nuance.

## **Grammatical Zero**

Among the grammatical numbers there is a grammatical zero

The grammatical zero is used for multiple things

As mentioned earlier we can have a sentence like

Shafbavadashro Roger Rabbit

"No man killed Roger Rabbit"

The “No man” indicates that there is no suspect who would have done it. It emphasizes the verb. Male is default in such a formulation but any gender can be used

Shabavafdashro Roger Rabbit

"Roger Rabbit was not killed"

In this sentence the verb was negated rather than the noun so it indicates a specifically known suspect

## **5 Pronouns & Pseudopronouns**

Canonical pronouns have disappeared; Ki endings now carry person information. **Pseudopronouns** are full nouns inflected with Ki suffixes to supply pragmatic nuance.

| Gloss | Pseudopronoun | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| ‘you + me (alone)’ | **Thijith** | child gender, exclusive |
| ‘you + me (few others)’ | **Thishith** | inclusive, paucal |
| ‘you + me (many others)’ | **Thikith** | inclusive, plural |
| ‘mother–child pair (1st person)’ | **Dzahabath** | root **dzahab** ‘mother–child dyad’ \+ 1sg Chi‑Ki |
| ‘we (many mother–child pairs)’ | **Dzahahabath** | collective \+ plural Ki |
| Pedagogical 1sg forms | **Gatharath** ‘my body’; **Pathasath** ‘my name’ |  |

## **7 Contact Influence**

Neighbouring languages integrate elements of Aelaki morphology to varying degrees.

### **7.1 Borrowed Ki in Neknek**

While Neknek never re‑grammaticalised Ki as agreement markers, speakers append them **phonotactically** to certain loans—especially personal names and plant terms.

*Sapling loan*

| Language | Singular | Partitive plural | Collective |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Aelaki** | **Basolush** | **Basosolush** | **Baselish** |
| **Neknek** | **Basolush** | **Basolushk** (Ki‑paucal) | **Baselish** |

Neknek only applies **reduplicative plurals** inside explicitly Aelaki‑derived stems.

### **7.2 Other contact zones**

* The umlaut collective has diffused into several unrelated families as a prestige marker for **totality**.

* Numerals 1–10 (with partitive/collective alternants) are pan‑regional trade jargon.

---

## **First person nouns**

Aelaki has no first person pronouns. Pronouns fell out of use long ago.

Non-dropped 1st person noun types:

1\. "My-type nouns"  
Ones that use the inalienable possessive to describe something like a body part. My body, my name, my soul, my ass. These ones tend to be used to express nuances of the action happening

1.5. "1p-\>3p nouns"  
"My-type nouns" that are declined in the third person and used for specific grammatical contexts. Mainly jussive and optative. You cannot use your name in a sentence like this, it is considered ungrammatical and would imply someone else with the same name. The possessive makes it clear that you are changing person. 

2\. "Social nouns"  
These ones tend to be used to imply a relationship between the speaker and other people in the conversation. The "me and you" noun is a common one. These are all plural, and usually dyadic. Their pluralization works a bit weirdly 

3\. "Common pronominalized nouns"  
These ones are just common nouns or proper nouns that are declined in 1st person. This tends to be done in official contexts. A police officer might refer to themselves as "officer.1p.SING.MALE". Some people use their names like this, usually as a way of introducing themselves.

##  **8 Aspect, Tense & Mood**

Aelaki verbs express **aspect**, **tense**, and an evidentially‑tinged **mood** in a templatic slot between C₂ and C₃ of the root. Aspect is primary; tense/mood selectors layer on via dedicated **prefixes** or **suffixes**.

### **8.1 Aspect series (4 polarity)**

| Aspect label | Morphology | Core meaning | Example (root *zh‑r‑n*) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Base (live)** | C₁V₁C₂V₂C₃ | intransitive active, neutral telicity | **zharan** ‘(someone) lives’ |
| **Atelic perfect** | **Zhoron** | present result of unbounded action | **zhoron** ‘is alive (state achieved)’ |
| **Continuative** | **Zhororon** (C₂ redup.) | ongoing, imperfective | **zhororon** ‘living (in progress)’ |
| **Telic perfect** | **Zheren** (umlaut) | action completed with goal met | **zheren** ‘lived (life completed)’ |
| **Negative polarity** | **Zhofron** (f‑infix) | negated event/state, sometimes interrogative or subjunctive with complex sentences | **zhofron** ‘does not live / lifeless’ |

### **aspects in present**

In present tense aspects work differently  
Continuative is the same  
Atelic perfect is habitual  
Telic perfect is gnomic 

### 

### 

### **8.2 Tense–evidential grid (18 cells)**

Aelaki distinguishes **six temporal frames**, each cross‑cut by four evidential or modal suffixes (/sher/ mythical, /ro/ reported, /shë/ witnessed, /shëm/ inferred). Two future cells replace evidential suffixes with **intention** or **prediction**.

| Frame | Base marker | Auditory | Witnessed | Inferred | Intention¹ | Optative | Deliberative |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Past** | – | **‑ro** | **‑shë** | **‑shëm** | – | – | – |
| **Mythic past** | **‑sher** | – | – | – | – | – | – |
| **Hesternal** (yesterday) | **goki‑…** | **‑ro** | **‑shë** | **‑shëm** | – | – | – |
| **Present** | (unmarked) | – | – | – | – | – | – |
| **Hodiernal** (today) | **go‑…** | **‑ngrom** | **‑nshë** | **‑nshëm** | **‑ng**² | **\-nkya** | **\-nkyam** |
| **Crastinal** (tomorrow) | **goki‑…** | **‑rum** | – | **‑mu** | **‑ng**² | **\-ya** | **\-yam** |
| **Future** |  | **‑rum** |  | **‑mu** |  | **\-ya** | **\-yam** |

¹ **Intention** is restricted to **1st‑person** subjects and realised by a dedicated stem modification (metathesis). When in a 1st person inclusive plural it behaves as a cohortative, as a 2nd person it acts as an imperative, and as a 3rd or 4th person as a jussive.   
 ² Same stem‑internal modification as intention; context disambiguates today vs. tomorrow.

*Example paradigm (continuative aspect)*

* **go‑zh‑roron‑ngrom** ‘will apparently be living later *today* (hearsay)’

* **go‑zh‑roron‑rum** ‘will apparently be living *tomorrow* (hearsay)’

* **zh‑roron‑mu** ‘is predicted to keep living (distant future)’

---

### **8.4 Diachronic notes on the tense–evidential matrix**

Early Classical Aelaki employed **four independent morphemes** that could stack inside the verbal template:

| Proto‑morpheme | Allomorphs | Gloss | Modern reflex |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **ü /‑nü** | /ü/ (prefix)  **‑nü** (suffix) | explicit **present, witnessed visually** | fossilised in rare emphatic declaratives, replaced by zero marking in the modern language |
| **ə /‑shë** | /ə/  **‑shë** | **witnessed past** (visual) | survives as **‑shë** in the witnessed past column |
| **o /‑ro** | /o/  **‑ro** | **auditory / hearsay** evidential | survives as **‑ro** (past reported) and in compounds |
| **u /‑mu** | /u/  **‑mu** | **inferential / predictive** | retains function in future prediction |

Through erosion and re‑analysis these elements fused, yielding the modern 18‑cell grid:

* **Mythical past ‑sher** \< *‑shë‑ro* (visual + hearsay). Speakers reinterpret the compound as referring to events so old that only legends remain.

* **Inferred past ‑shëm** \< *‑shë‑mu* (visual + inferential), now restricted to deduction from traces.

* **Crastinal reported ‑rum** \< *‑ro‑mu* (hearsay \+ predictive).

* The **go‑** hodiernal/crastinal prefix derives from *go* ‘day’; its scope has broadened, so distinction between “later today” and “tomorrow” relies heavily on context in colloquial speech.

*Pragmatic note*: Hodiernal forms (**‑ngrom, ‑nshë, ‑nshëm, verbal‑ng**) are the most fluid; speakers often override them with explicit adverbials when precision is required.

## **The Imperative**

The Aelaki imperative mood is an extremely common mood. 80% of first person future statements are made in the imperative mood. 

The imperative mood used to only apply to transitive verbs. And occur via a shift in the word order from the standard SVO to SOV. However in the modern form this has been substantially abbreviated into 

The first person imperative mood marks a promise to do something in the future

Intransitive verbs developed their imperative forms later from a dummy pronoun üfüf or ïfïf

1st person 2nd person imperative

## **“Quirky jussive”**

The “Quirky jussive” is a form that is used to express a jussive for the 1st or 2nd person

It requires a pseudopronoun that will be marked in 3rd person. This limits it to only some of the few “canonical pseudopronouns” which have no independent usage as pronouns

| Usage | Pseudopronoun | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Inclusive  | **Thijish** | child gender, exclusive |
| 1p singular | **Gatharash** ‘my body’;  |  |
| 1p singular | **Pathasash** ‘my name’ |  |
| 2p singular | Gajasash “your body" |  |
| 2p singular | **Pajasash** ‘your name’ |  |
| Exclusive plural 1p | **Gathatharash** ‘my body’;  |  |
| Exclusive plural 1p | **Pathathasash** ‘my name’ |  |
| Plural 2p | Gajasash “your body" |  |
| Plural 2p | **Pajasash** ‘your name’ |  |
| Inclusive plural 1p | **Gætharash** ‘my body’;  |  |
| Inclusive plural 1p | **Pæthasash** ‘my name’ |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |

The quirky jussive implies a loss of agency on the part of the subject. For example “You should stop using heroin”. Or “I should stop overeating”.

It is much more common in the first person and often indicates a perception of the task being difficult, or just that one should perform the task. Since the proper 1st person imperative is strictly a promise.  
. 

# **Quirky Optative**

Quirky optative is similar to Quirky jussive. 

It is used to express counterfactuals more than expressing a desire for something to be a certain way

Hodiernal Tense is required for a counterfactual. 

Non Quirky: I want to eat that cake 

vs

Quirky: I wish I had a car

# **Stative verbs**

These are my stative verbs and their aspects

Needs a bit of work for how umlaut works since I have a contradiction here

Ho-: probable. I am about to fall Ho'apafath  
Nü-: Inchoative. I started falling Nü'apafath  
Nï-(umlaut stem): I stopped falling (landed for this verb) Nï'æpæfath  
Lu-: Resumptive Ru'apafath  
Ke-:Almost Ke'apafath I almost fell

thoughts?   
Zoduk \= know  
Hozoduk \= Curious  
Nüzoduk \= Learn  
Nïzedik \= Forget  
Luzedik \= Remember  
Kozoduk \= Almost learn

## Stative aspects

Stative verbs cannot take on quite as many aspects as active verbs. The raw form of Zoduk has just two forms

Zoduk \- Standard  
Zedik \- Gnomic

Gnomic applies to a wide group universally having this trait

However the verb can be made continuative through these prefix forms

Nünüzoduk \= Learning  
Nïnïzedik \= Forgetting  
Luluzedik \= Remembering  
Kokozoduk \= Almost learning

Note that for the

### **Notes on methodology**

\* Counts derive from a fictional one‑million‑word conversational corpus balanced across informal chat (50 %), narration (30 %), ceremonial speech (10 %), and reported dialogue (10 %).  
 \* Percentages are proportional to token frequency, not type variety.  
 \* Day‑tagged forms (hodiernal, hesternal, crastinal) collectively average **25 %** of all finite verbs; the rest use untaged generic past/future TAM.

## **Statistics on TAM usage**

## **9 Clause Structure & Word Order**

**Historical baseline (SVO).** Classical texts are parsed as **Subject – Verb – Object**, but modern speech is almost entirely **pro‑drop**, so the finite verb tends to surface first. The default spoken order is therefore **V(S)(O)**, with arguments recovered from Ki clitics or context.

### **9.1 Argument marking with Ki placement**

| Verb type | Prefix Ki (left of stem) | Suffix Ki (right of stem) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Transitive** | **subject** | **object** |
| **Intransitive (active)** | **subject** | – |
| **Intransitive (stative)** | – | **subject** |

### **9.2 Imperative template**

Imperatives historically employed **S‑O‑V** order. In modern usage they retain a frozen morphology:  
 `[SUBJ‑Ki][OBJ‑Ki]‑VERB`. This pattern is now the **default 1st‑person futurative**, e.g.

**Thu‑bal‑zar** “Let **me** catch **two** (fish)\!”

First‑person speakers strongly prefer the **visual past** for narration of completed actions; except in humorous or self‑deprecating references, one avoids assigning oneself the **mythical past**.

---

## **10 Adjectival Derivation & Limited TAM**

Adjectives originate from **stative verb stems**. They still obey the morphology for comparative (**reduplication**) and superlative (**umlaut**) and negation (**\-f- infix**) and must **agree in gender & number** with the head noun.

Adjectives keep an **eight‑way TAM** but lack full tense:

| Marker | Gloss | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **‑shë** | visually confirmed | **koran-uth‑shë** “visibly bright” |
| **‑ro** | known by testimony | **koran-uth‑ro** “reportedly bright” |
| **‑mu** | inferred | **koran-uth‑mu** “apparently bright” |
| **\-ya** | hopefully | **koran-uth‑ya** “hopefully bright” |
| **go-...‑shë** | visually confirmed | **gokoran-uth‑shë** “currently visibly bright” |
| **go-...‑ro** | known by testimony | **gokoran-uth‑ro** “currently reportedly bright” |
| **go-...‑mu** | inferred | **gokoran-uth‑mu** “currently apparently bright” |
| **go-...-ya** | hopefully | **gokoran-uth‑ya** “hopefully currently bright” |

Note that attaching Go- to adjectives indicates a present tense. It might be used to say something like “The now American Einstein once lived in Germany”. 

**Goki- is never used.** 

**Total variation of them**

**Evidentials:**

**visual**  
**audio**  
**inferential**  
**optative**

**tenses**  
**hodiernal**  
**non-hodiernal**

**aspects:**  
**regular**  
**comparative**  
**superlative**  
**negative/irrealis**

# **Aelaki Adverb Morphology**

Aelaki adverbs evolved from active intransitive converbs. But have since developed a more reduced morphology. 

Adverbs are built on a **root + *‑te*** frame and **always strictly agree** with verbal tense. Evidentialities can differ but normally agree, and disagreeing evidentialities can add more subtle information to a clause**.** Four stem alternations give comparative nuance and are independent of tense. Up to four evidentialities can be used depending on tense of the verb in question. 

| Tense / Day layer | Day prefix | Auditory | Visual | Inferential | Intent / Optative |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Mythic past** | — | **\-tesher** | — | \-tesherëm | — |
| **Past** | — | **\-tero** | \-teshë | \-teshëm | — |
| **Hesternal** *(yesterday)* | **goki‑** | **\-tero** | \-teshë | \-teshëm | — |
| **Present** | — | \-te |  |  |  |
| **Hodiernal** *(today)* | **go‑** | **\-nkerom** | \-nkeshë | \-nkeshëm | \-nkeya |
| **Future** | **goki‑** | **\-terom** | — | \-temu | \-teya |
| **Crastinal** *(tomorrow)* | — | **\-terom** | — | \-temu | \-teya |

**Note on hodiernal sandhi:** before the suffixes ‑rum/‑shë/‑shëm/‑yam the root inserts **‑nk‑** → *zada‑* → *zadank‑*.

**Note on intentive/optative:** Because the intentive stem modification cannot be done on an adverb, the optative and intentive are merged. \-ya is considered an evidential agreement with either one

**Note on mythic inferential:** This is an independent adverb only evidentiality. It refers solely to scriptural commentary and not to beliefs about what happened in the past based on archaeology

A corpus survey (1 M word, informal speech) shows **90 %** of adverbs matching the matrix verb’s tense‑evidential choice. Mismatches signal sarcasm, reported speech, or epistemic distancing.

---

## **2 Comparative stem alternations**

| Degree | Template | Example ‘long’ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Positive | ROOT‑te | **za‑da‑te** “lengthy” |
| Comparative | **Root‑C²‑te** (redup.\~C₂) | **za‑da‑da‑te** “lengthier” |
| Superlative | **Umlaut Vowels** | **zæ‑dæ‑te** “lengthliest” |
| Subjunctive / Neg. | **F‑infix \+ vowel sync.** | **za‑f‑da‑f‑te** “non‑lengthy / ought to be lengthy” |

These grades stack freely with any tense‑evidential form: e.g. **goki‑zædæte‑rum** “*will be* extremely long tomorrow (auditory source).”

---

## **3 Paradigm snippets**

| Clause | Gloss |
| ----- | ----- |
| **zadate‑sher** | “was long (mythic past)” |
| **goki‑zadate‑rum** | “will be long tomorrow (auditory)” |
| **go‑zadankeshë** | “is long today (seen)” |
| **zadate‑ya** | “should be long (optative future)” |
| **goki‑zadadate‑ng** | “I intend it to be *longer* tomorrow” |

---

## Mythical tense

Zadatesher \= Lengthly  
Zadatesherëm \= Lengthly (inferred from auditory evidence)

## Past tense adverbs

Zadatero \= Lengthly (past auditory)

Zadateshë \= Lengthly (past visual)

Zadateshëm \= Lengthly (past inferential)

## Hesternal

Gokizadatero \= Lengthly (hesternal auditory)

Gokizadateshë \= Lengthly (hesternal visual)

Gokizadateshëm \= Lengthly (hesternal inferential)

## Present tense

Zadate \= Lengthly

## Hodiernal

Gozadankerom \= Lengthly (hodiernal auditory)

Gozadankeshë \= Lengthly (hodiernal visual)

Gozadankeshëm \= Lengthly (hodiernal inferential)

Gozadankeya \= Intended to be lengthly (only first person)

## Future

Zadaterom \= Lengthly (future auditory)

Zadatemu \= Lengthly (future inferential)

Zadateya \= Lengthly (future intentional)

## Crastinal

Gokizadaterom \= Lengthly (crastinal auditory)

Gokizadatemu \= Lengthly (crastinal inferential)

Gokizadateya \= Lengthly (crastinal intentional)

By contrast comparative stem modifications can occur in all adverbs regardless of tense. There are only four such ones

## Comparative stem modifications

Zadate \= Lengthly

Zadadate \= Lengthier

Zædæte \= Lengthliest

Zafdafte \= Not lengthly/subjunctive lengthly

There is no go- or goki- for adverbs except in agreement with the verb

Example

Long live the king Sanash Shazhærænya Zadateya 

king-3p.MASC.SING 3p.MASC.SING-live.CONT-OPT.FUTURE long-ADV-OPT.FUTURE

## **11 Numerals and Their Negative Series**

Numerals inflect for **gender agreement** and appear in six semantic roles.

| Role | Gloss | Morphology (base 2\) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Cardinal | exact count | **Bal** “two” |
| Ordinal | ordered position | **Kezon** “second” |
| Partitive | subset of a set | **Babal** “two of (them)” |
| Fractional | reciprocal fraction | **Kalakel** “half” |
| Collective | whole set of n | **Bæl** “both” |
| Adverbial | event frequency | **Balte** “twice” |

A productive **negative series** inserts /f/ before C₂: *Mafal, Maflon,* etc. Their semantics vary:

* **Negative cardinal**: absent quantity or explicit “‑n”.

* **Negative ordinal**: counting **backwards** (e.g., *Maflon* “second‑last”).

* **Negative partitive**: removal of items.

* **Negative collective**: outstanding **debt/obligation**.

* **Negative adverbial**: reversal or undoing of prior actions.

*Illustration*  
 **æ‑zar Mafal‑goro‑thu** “I lost four (male) fish.”  
 **go‑dapaz‑Maflon‑shë** “I hit the second‑last target yesterday (saw it myself).”

# **Aelaki Numerals & Counter System**

*Dedicated companion to the **Allochy Grammar Guide**; reference variety: capital‑region standard, c. CE 1800.*

---

## **1 Overview**

Aelaki employs a richly derivational numeral system. Each integer skeleton is plugged into the language’s triconsonantal template and then shaped by:

1. **Gender vowels** (child *u/i*, female *o/e*, male *a/æ*); integers inherit a **natural gender** used mainly in mathematics and ritual language.

2. **Six semantic roles** (cardinal, ordinal, partitive, fractional, collective, adverbial) created by fixed affixes.

3. The **/f/‑infix** for negative counterparts (absence, debt, reversal).

4. Agreement with **counters**—classifiers that themselves possess gender and Ki properties.

**Mnemonic rhyme (traditional)**  
 *“Woman Zero bore Child One; Child grew to Woman Two, then Man Three…”*  
 Each subsequent integer alternates gender, inspiring didactic poems that sometimes extend to 60 or algorithmically to infinity.

## **2.1 Gender alternation rule**

* **Even numbers** → *female* gender (o/e vowels).

* **Odd numbers (except 1\)** → *male* gender (a/æ vowels).

* **1 & 10 and all powers of ten** → *child* gender (u/i vowels).  
   Fractions universally take the **child** pattern, mirroring their conceptual “smallness.”

---

## **3 Negative Numerals**

Insert **/f/** before C₂. Semantics differ by role:

| Role | Example (4) | Meaning |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Cardinal | **Mafal** | −4 / four absent |
| Ordinal | **Maflon** | second‑last |
| Partitive | **Mafmal** | removal of four |
| Fractional | **Mafalfel** | quarter owed / missing |
| Collective | **Mæfæl** | debt of four |
| Adverbial | **Mafalte** | undo four times |

Zero (*female* by myth) surfaces mainly in mathematics: **Fol** ‘0’; **Fofol** negative zero (rare, poetic).

---

## **4 Counters**

Every counter noun bears a fixed gender and plugs into numeral agreement as follows:

| Domain | Counter (sg) | Gender | Example phrase |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Animals | **goro** | male | **bal‑goro** “two animals (female num \+ male counter: counter’s gender wins)” |
| Flat objects | **sele** | female | **bhæn‑sele** “all three sheets” |
| Liquids (measure) | **tufu** | child | **kalakel‑tufu** “half‑measure of water” |

**Rule:** In transitive clauses with inanimate heads, the counter supplies the animate gender needed for Ki subject/object marking.

---

## **5 Fractions & Ratios**

Fractions concatenate **partitive numerator \+ fractional denominator**:

**Babul Bhavilish** “two‑thirds”  
 **Papan Kalakel** “one‑half”

Ratios / equations use the ordinal series plus the copular verb:

**Kezon æ‑zar \= Bhavel æ‑zar.** “Second fish equals one‑third fish (riddle format).”

---

## **6 Numerological Lore**

Long didactic poems narrate the *child → woman → man* cycle through successive integers. Variants:

1. **1-3: Traditional nursery rhyme**  
2. **0-3: Variant with zero**  
3. **Duodecimal (0‑12)**: used in early schooling.

4. **Sexagesimal (1‑60)**: embeds ritual symbolism for each zodiac month.

5. **Infinite generator**: modern printings employ code that appends stanzas on demand, famously demonstrated in the proof that rational numbers are countable.

Sample stanza (7 → 8):

*Zhal grew weary, found the spring; Fal blossomed fair, her petals eight…*

---

## **7 Sample Sentences**

1. **æ‑zar bal‑goro‑thu**  
    *MASC.SG‑fish two‑CL.animal‑1sg*  
    “I caught **two** fish.”

2. **go‑dapaz‑Maflon‑shë**  
    *HOD‑shoot‑4ᵗʰʟᵃˢᵗ‑VIS*  
    “Yesterday I hit the second‑last target (saw it myself).”

3. **Pæn‑sele‑ïfïf oron‑ro.**  
    *all‑sheet‑INAN.PL exist‑REP*  
    “They say **all** the sheets are there.”

---

## **8 To‑Do & Cross‑References**

* Expand table beyond 10 for full base‑12 set.

* Document **decimal vs. duodecimal** counting in trade jargon.

* Link to *Allochy Grammar Guide* § 11 for interaction with sentence negation.

*Last revised:* 26 May 2025

# **Aelaki Converb System (v 0.9 draft)**

 **Class I – Prefix/TAM** & **Class II – Suffix/Day‑Sensitive**.  
 Day markers (**go‑, goki‑, go‑IMP‑**) insert right between any verbal prefix and the lexical root.

---

## **1 Class I – Prefix Converbs (keep full TAM)**

| Prefix | Clause link (core sense) | Typical contrast (past / fut. / counter‑f.) | Mini‑example with run (matrix) & eat (converb) | Meaning | Usage notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **ki‑** | purposive “in order to” |  | **Thu‑guzazar ki‑gararak‑mu.**  |  “I’m running so that I *will* eat.” |  |
| **ha‑** | causal “because” | cause may be earlier or later | **Thu‑guzazar ha‑gararak‑shë.** | I’m running because I ate | If cause is chronologically after the event then it is interpreted as the expectation of it as the cause. |
| **sa‑** | conditional “if/when” | distinguishes unreal past vs. future | **Thu-go‑gzarang sa‑gararak‑shëm**¹**.** | I am running if I ate | Highly restrictive see later section for instructions |
| **ra‑** | concessive “even though” |  | **Thu‑guzazar ra‑gararak‑shë.** | I am running even though I ate |  |
| **mu‑** | instrumental “by means of” | optional, keeps TAM | **Thu‑guzazar mu‑gararak‑shë.** | I am running through eating (I got the calories I am using by eating) |  |
| **ne‑** | adversative “instead of” | “instead of having eaten / eating” | **Thu‑guzazar ne‑gararak‑shë.** | I am running instead of having had eaten |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

¹ **Conditional** has TAM usage requirements. Past counterfactual uses \-mu for your own inference, or \-ro for other people’s inferences. Present counterfactual is done with go-...-nshëm  or   
 ² Same stem‑internal modification as intention; context disambiguates today vs. tomorrow.

*Syntax:* `[ PREFIX‑ [DAY‑] (SUBJ‑Ki) (INST‑Ki) ROOT.ASPECT-(OBJ‑Ki)-‑TAM ]` → **converb phrase**

## **Causal converb rules**

## **Conditional converb rules**

The conditional converb places heavy limitations on allowed TAM 

Since the main verb is the thing that will happen under the condition of the converb. It cannot take the visual evidentiality since that is strictly realis mood

## Allowed moods and interpretations

1. Auditory: someone else said this would happen in the even of subordinate clause  
   1. If the toiler has water, they said it would flush  
2. Inferred: I infer with my own logic that this would happen in the even of subordinate clause  
   1. If the toilet has water, I think it will flush  
3. Intentive: I will do this in the event of the subordinate clause  
   1. If you touch her, I will kill you  
4. Optative: It would be nice if this happened in the event of the subordinate clause  
   1. I wish cats would purr when I pet them  
5. Deliberative: Should I do this in the event of the subordinate clause  
   1. Should I run if I ate?

Permitted main verbs

| **Hodiernal** (today) | **go‑…** | **‑ngrom** | **‑nshë** | **‑nshëm** | **‑ng**² | **\-nkya** | **\-nkyam** |
| **Crastinal** (tomorrow) | **goki‑…** | **‑rum** | – | **‑mu** | **‑ng**² | **\-ya** | **\-yam** |
| **Future** |  | **‑rum** |  | **‑mu** | **(imp)** | **\-ya** | **\-yam** |

Permitted converb tenses

## **2 Class II – Suffix Converbs (eat the TAM)**

### **2.1 Day layer**

* **unmarked** \= unspecified day

* **go‑** \= hodiernal (*today*)

* **goki‑** \= adjacent day (*yesterday / tomorrow*, context decides)

* **go‑IMP‑** \= crastinal imperative (tomorrow, command/intention)

*The day prefix is mandatory if the clause needs an explicit day anchor; otherwise omit it.*

### **2.2 Core suffix set**

| Suffix | Link sense | Example (matrix run \+ converb eat) | Loose gloss |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **‑shëlon** | **before** (posterior) | **Thu‑guzazar goki‑gararak‑shëlon.** | “I’m running **before** I eat tomorrow/yesterday.” |
| **‑mulon** | **after / once** (anterior) | **Thu‑guzazar go‑gararak‑mulon.** | “… **after** I eat today.” |
| **‑lon** | **right after** (sequential) | **Thu‑guzazar gararak‑lon.** | “… right after I eat.” |
| **‑ndor** | **until** (terminative) | **Thu‑guzazar goki‑gararak‑ndor.** | “… **until** I eat tomorrow/yesterday.” |
| **‑lok** | **where** (locative) | **Thu‑guzazar go‑gararak‑lok.** | “… **where** I eat today.” |
| **\-mutu** | **Simulative** | **Thu‑guzazar tu‑gararak‑mu.** | “I am running as though I were eating” |

### **2.3 Role & stance suffixes (tenseless but day‑compatible)**

| Suffix | Sense | Example | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **‑rum** | beneficiary | **… go‑gararak‑rum.** | “for the sake of eating today” |
| **‑wom** | comitative | **… gararak‑wom.** | “together with eating” (day prefix optional) |
| **‑səf** | exceptive | **… goki‑gararak‑səf.** | “except for eating tomorrow/yesterday” |
| **‑vai** | restrictive | **… gararak‑vai.** | “only if/when eating” |

*Syntax:* `[ [DAY‑]  (SUBJ‑Ki) (INST‑Ki) ROOT‑ASPECT-(OBJ‑Ki)‑SUFFIX ]` (no extra TAM)

## **3 Placement of day markers in finite verbs**

Regular finite verbs now mirror converbs:

(SUBJ‑Ki)  \[go‑ | goki‑ | go‑IMP‑\]  ROOT  \+  ASPECT  \+  TAM  (+ OBJ‑Ki)

Hodiernal keeps ordinary evidential TAM; crastinal imperative uses the dedicated stem‑mutation rule.

---

## **4 To do**

* Decide whether **‑lok** ever needs its own TAM (promote to Class I if so).

* Flesh out Ki switch‑reference interaction examples.

* Specify phonology of the **IMP‑stem‑mutation**.

---

## **Prepositions**

at/during

## **Complex sentences**

VSO is the standard independent clause form

Exception: If there is an instrumental of  it goes  
Subject-CI-Verb-Object Dative

CI \= Comitative or Instrumental

If another clause comes then Nono or No or Ne is used to differentiate it

# Nono

Nono indicates a new object is the subject of the next clause. Or in some cases topic

No indicates an old noun is now the subject. Switching roles can be this way even if the topic is the same

Ne indicates a grouping of a list into one group which is now collective masculine, and then can be the subject or object of a sentence

Jack ate an apple Nono a fly bit Jack

The topic switcher needs to be used if ths topic switches from subject to object or indirect object

The topic switcher needs to be used if the subject of a transitive or active verb then becomes the subject of a stative verb or vice versa

Jack ate an apple Nono Jack got sick

# No

The partitive topic switcher no is used for a few things

Generally assuming knowledge, you can start a sentence with “No” to express “As we already know”

Start of book chapters and some news articles 

Used for taking a member out of a list

# Ne

List a bunch of nouns. Then Ne, and then they are treated as a dropped subject or object

Cats and dogs and men and women Ne Live

In english that would be used with “all” but Ne can be used for many subsequent verbs and converbs
