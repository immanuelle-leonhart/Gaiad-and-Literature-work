# Gaiad Project

A comprehensive cosmological mythology combining epic poetry with detailed genealogical records.

## Contents

### Epic Poetry (`epic/`)
The **Gaiad Epic** - 20 chapters of cosmological creation myth told in iambic pentameter with ABAB rhyme scheme, chronicling the love story of Aster and Andromeda across the universe.

- `chapter_01.md` through `chapter_20.md` - Main epic chapters (new format)
- `old-versions/` - Original 53 chapters in prose/verse format (different storyline)
- `tools/` - Validation scripts for meter and rhyme scheme  
- `reference/` - Character indices and analysis

**Important**: The new chapters (1-20) and old chapters (1-53) are **separate stories** in the same mythological universe, not revisions of each other.

### Genealogy Data

- `Gaiad.ged` - Primary genealogy file (manually revised and complete)
- `Old/` - Historical versions and references
- `Gaiad_Photos/` - Associated media files
