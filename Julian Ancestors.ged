2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Faunus was worshipped across the Roman Empire for many centuries. An example of this was a set of thirty two 4th century spoons found near Thetford in England in 1979. They had been engraved with t
2 CONC he name "Faunus", and each also had a different epithet after the god's name. The spoons also bore Christian symbols, and it has been suggested that these were initially Christian but later taken and 
2 CONC devoted to Faunus by pagans. The 4th century was a time of largescale Christianisation, and it provides us with evidence that even at the decline of Roman paganism, the god Faunus was still worshipped

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Greco-Roman mythology, '''Aeneas''' was a Trojan hero, the son of the prince Anchises and the goddess Aphrodite (Venus). His father was a first cousin of King Priam of Troy (both being grandsons
2 CONC  of Ilus, founder of Troy), making Aeneas a second cousin to Priam's children (such as Hector and Paris).=
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aeneas survived the sack of Troy by the Greeks. His adventures are recounted in Virgil’s ''Aeneid'': He fled the burning city with his wife Creusa, young son Ascanius, and aged father Anchises. H
2 CONC is wife was lost in the confusion, but Aeneas, leading his son and carrying his aged father on his back, made his way to safety. Led by Aphrodite (his mother), Aeneas with a band of fugitives set sail
2 CONC  to find a new beginning but was shipwrecked at Carthage, where he stayed with Queen Dido. After many adventures eventually he reached Italy, where he was welcomed by King Latinus who gave Aeneas his 
2 CONC daughter, Lavinia, to wife. His descendants Romulus and Remus were founders of Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He is considered an important figure in Greek and Roman legend and history. He is the main character in Virgil's ''Aeneid''. He is also a character in Homer's ''Iliad'', Quintus Smyrnaeus' ''Postho
2 CONC merica'', and Shakespeare's ''Troilus and Cressida''. Snorri Sturluson identifies him with the Norse Æsir Vidarr.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Mythology'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the ''Iliad'', Aeneas is the leader of the Dardanians (allies of the Trojans), and a principal lieutenant of Hector, son of the Trojan king Priam. In the poem, Aeneas's mother Aphrodite frequent
2 CONC ly comes to his aid on the battlefield; he is also a favorite of Apollo. Aphrodite and Apollo rescue Aeneas from combat with Diomedes of Argos, who nearly kills him, and carry him away to Pergamos for
2 CONC  healing. Even Poseidon, who normally favors the Greeks, comes to Aeneas's rescue when the latter falls under the assault of Achilles, noting that Aeneas, though from a junior branch of the royal fami
2 CONC ly, is destined to become king of the Trojan people.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As seen in the first books of the ''Aeneid'', Aeneas is one of the few Trojans who were not killed in battle or enslaved when Troy fell. When Troy was sacked by the Greeks, Aeneas, after being comm
2 CONC anded by the gods to flee, gathered a group, collectively known as the ''Aeneads'', who then traveled to Italy and became progenitors of the Romans. The ''Aeneads'' included Aeneas's trumpeter Misenus
2 CONC , his father Anchises, his friends Achates, Sergestus and Acmon, the healer Lapyx, the steady helmsman Palinurus, and his son Ascanius (also known as Iulus, Julus, or Ascanius Julius.) He carried with
2 CONC  him the Lares and Penates, the statues of the household gods of Troy, and transplanted them to Italy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aeneas tells Dido about the fall of Troy, by Pierre-Narcisse Guérin.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After a brief, but fierce storm sent up against the group at Juno's request, and several failed attempts to found cities, Aeneas and his fleet made landfall at Carthage after six years of wandering
2 CONC s. Aeneas had a year long affair with the Carthaginian queen Dido (also known as Elissa), who proposed that the Trojans settle in her land and that she and Aeneas reign jointly over their peoples. Onc
2 CONC e again, this was in favour of Juno, who was told of the fact that her favorite city would eventually be defeated by the Trojans' descendants. However, the messenger god Mercury was sent by Jupiter an
2 CONC d Aphrodite to remind Aeneas of his journey and his purpose, thus compelling him to leave secretly and continue on his way. When Dido learned of this, she ordered her sister Anna to construct a pyre, 
2 CONC she said, to get rid of Aeneas' possessions, left behind by him in his haste to leave. Standing on it, Dido uttered a curse that would forever pit Carthage against Rome. She then committed suicide by 
2 CONC stabbing herself with the same sword she gave Aeneas when they first met and then falling on the pyre. Anna reproached the mortally wounded Dido. Meanwhile, Juno, looking down on the tragedy and moved
2 CONC  by Dido's plight, sent Iris to make Dido's passage to Hades quicker and less painful. When Aeneas later traveled to Hades, he called to her ghost but she neither spoke to nor acknowledged him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The company stopped on the island of Sicily during the course of their journey. After the first trip, before the Trojans went to Carthage, Achaemenides, one of Odysseus' crew who had been left behi
2 CONC nd, traveled with them. After visiting Carthage, the Trojans returned to Sicily where they were welcomed by Acestes, king of the region and son of the river Crinisus by a Dardanian woman.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Latinus, king of the Latins, welcomed Aeneas's army of exiled Trojans and let them reorganize their life in Latium. His daughter Lavinia had been promised to Turnus, king of the Rutuli, but Latinus
2 CONC  received a prophecy that Lavinia would be betrothed to one from another land — namely, Aeneas. Latinus heeded the prophecy, and Turnus consequently declared war on Aeneas at the urging of Juno, who
2 CONC  was aligned with King Mezentius of the Etruscans and Queen Amata of the Latins. Aeneas' forces prevailed. Turnus was killed and his people were captured. According to Livy, Aeneas was victorious but 
2 CONC Latinus died in the war. Aeneas founded the city of Lavinium, named after his wife. He later welcomed Dido's sister, Anna Perenna, who then committed suicide after learning of Lavinia's jealousy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The circumstances of Aeneas' death are uncertain. Some affirm that Aeneas disappeared during a battle against the army of Mezentius (an ally of his enemy Turnus), but others say that he died in Thr
2 CONC ace without ever reaching Italy, or that he, after having settled his people in Italy, returned home and became king of Troy, leaving the kingdom, after his death, to his son Ascanius. It is also told
2 CONC  that Aphrodite asked Zeus to make Aeneas immortal, and as Zeus granted her request, the river god Numicius washed away all of Aeneas' mortal part, and Aphrodite anointed him with Nectar and Ambrosia,
2 CONC  making him a god, whom the people later worshiped under the name of Indiges.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Family and legendary descendants'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aeneas had an extensive family tree. His wet-nurse was Caieta, and he is the father of Ascanius with Creusa, and of Silvius with Lavinia. The former, also known as Iulus (or Julius), founded Alba L
2 CONC onga and was the first in a long series of kings. According to the mythology outlined by Virgil in the ''Aeneid'', Romulus and Remus were descendants of Aeneas through their mother Rhea Silvia, making
2 CONC  Aeneas progenitor of the Roman people. Some early sources call him their father or grandfather, but considering the commonly accepted dates of the fall of Troy (1184 BC) and the founding of Rome (753
2 CONC  BC), this seems unlikely. The Julian family of Rome, most notably Julius Caesar and Augustus, traced their lineage to Ascanius and Aeneas, thus to the goddess Aphrodite. Through the Julians, the Pale
2 CONC monids also make this claim. The legendary kings of Britain also trace their family through a grandson of Aeneas, Brutus.

2 CONT <p>Aeneas</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aeneas - a relative of King Priamos - is today best known from Vergil'sgreat epos "The Aeneid." Homer describes him in "The Illiad" as thebravest of the Trojan heroes - next after Hektor - but he w
2 CONC as also knownfor his piety. Aeneas was one of the few survivors of the war and escaped- under the protection of Afrodite - over the ocean with his son. Hefounded Rome and both Julius Caesar and August
2 CONC us were commonly known todescend from this fine family.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Homers Illiad, Aeneas was an important Trojan warrior second only toHector and was the only warrior to be given any hope of the future: forPoseiden prophesised that he would reign over Troy (Ill
2 CONC ium) in years tocome and save the House of Dardanus from extinction. It was ironical thatAeneas, who complained that Priam the king of Troy never gave him duerecognition, was to succeed Priam as the r
2 CONC uler of Troy, but of course,Aeneas's Troy was the new Troy; Rome!
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aeneas was born on Mount Ida, the result of the union of the mortalAnchises and the goddess Aphrodite and given by his mother to themountain nymphs. At the age of five he was returned to his father
2 CONC . Whenthe Trojan war began Aeneas led the Dardanian troops (Dardania was a townon the slopes of Mount Ida) but was subserviant to Hector, Troys' supremecommander. Aeneas resented Hectors' superior pow
2 CONC er, Priams disdain, andthe domination of Troy over his own town. The Greek leader Achiles droveAeneas from Dardania and he took refuge in Troy and was their during theevents described in the Illiad.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Though he was a great warrior during the Trojan war it is not for thisthat he became important. His importance rests with the long voyage fromthe sacked and ravaged Troy (Illium) to the creation of
2 CONC  Rome. It is thisepic that is the basis for one of the greatest works of classicalliterature - The Aeneid by Virgil.
2 CONT <p>-----</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to the myth, Aenaes was married to Creusa, the daughter of KingPriam of Troy. Priam was the son of Laomedon, who was the son of Ilus,for whom Ilium was named. Ilium was another name for T
2 CONC roy. Ilus was a sonof Tros, for whom Troy was named.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aenaes was the son of the mortal Anchises and the goddess Venus, whosprang from Zeus' forehead.. Anchises was the son of Capys, who was theson of Assaracus, who was the son of Tros, for whom the ci
2 CONC ty of Troy wasnamed. Tros was the son of Ericthonius, who was the son of Dardanus andBatieia. Batieia was the daughter of Teucer, who was the son ofScamander. Dardanus was a son of Zeus. Zeus was a so
2 CONC n of the titansCronus and Rhea. Cronus was the son of Uranus. Uranus was supposed tohave been the beginning of all things. This is certainly not Christiantheology. It is offered only as a mythological

2 CONT <p>Notes for KING OF DARDANIA TROS:</p>
2 CONT <p>Two Ruling Houses  </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tros succeeded his father Erichthonius to the throne. He gave his name to the land (Troad) and to the people living in the Troad (Trojans). His son, Ganymede was so beautiful, that Zeus in the form
2 CONC  of an eagle, abducted the youth. Ganymede became the cupbearer in Olympus. Zeus gave Tros a couple of immortal horses and vine made of gold, to compensate for abducting the king's son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Dardanians people, was then divided into two separate groups, between his two other sons by Callirrhoë (Callirrhoe): Ilus and Assaracus. Assaracus succeeded his father and continued to rule at
2 CONC  Dardania, while Ilus chose to move closer to the sea. Ilus founded the city that he named Ilium, after himself. Ilium was, however, often called Troy, after his father. The two brothers began to rule
2 CONC  two separate houses.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the Dardanian line, Assaracus' son, Capys, married Themiste, daughter of Ilus and Eurydice. Capys became the father of Anchises. Anchises was a lover of Aphrodite, who bore him a son and hero, A
2 CONC eneas. Zeus struck Anchises with a thunderbolt, when he boasted of having slept with the love-goddess. He became a cripple, unable to walk. His son ruled Dardania in his place. Aeneas was the only lea
2 CONC der, who fought on the Trojan side, to survive the Trojan War.

2 CONT <p>Aeneas (Greek: ???e?a?, Aineías) was a Trojan hero, the son of prince Anchises and the goddess Aphrodite (Venus in Roman sources). His father was also the cousin of King Priam of Troy. The journey
2 CONC  of Aeneas from Troy, which led to the founding of the city that would one day become Rome, is recounted in Virgil's Aeneid. He is considered an important figure in Greek and Roman legend and history.
2 CONC  Aeneas is a character in Homer's Iliad and Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida.
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Legend</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the Iliad, Aeneas is the leader of the Dardans (allies of the Trojans), and a principal lieutenant of Hector, son of the Trojan king Priam. In the poem, Aeneas's mother Aphrodite frequently come
2 CONC s to his aid on the battlefield: he is also a favorite of Apollo. When Diomedes nearly kills Aeneas in battle, the latter is carried away from the ground by Aphrodite and Apollo, who heal him at Perga
2 CONC mos. Even Poseidon, who normally favors the Greeks, comes to Aeneas's rescue when the latter falls under the assault of Achilles, noting that Aeneas, though from a junior branch of the royal family, i
2 CONC s destined to become king of the Trojan people.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As seen in the first books of the Aeneid, Aeneas is one of the few survivors (or, in this sense, a Trojan who was not killed in battle or enslaved) of Troy's fall. When Troy was sacked by the Greek
2 CONC s, Aeneas, seeing the futility of defending a razed city, gathered a group, collectively known as the Aeneads, who then traveled to Italy and became progenitors of the Romans. The Aeneads included his
2 CONC  trumpeter Misenus, his father Anchises, his friends Achates, Sergestus and Acmon, the healer Iapyx, his son Ascanius, and their guide Mimas. He carried with him the Lares and Penates, the statues of 
2 CONC the household gods of Troy, and transplanted them to Italy.

2 CONT <p>Aeneas tells Dido about the fall of Troy, by Pierre-Narcisse Guérin.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After a brief, but fierce storm sent up against the group at Juno's request, Aeneas and his fleet made landfall at Carthage. Aeneas had a brief affair with the Carthaginian queen Elissa, also known
2 CONC  as Dido, who proposed that the Trojans settle in her land and that she and Aeneas reign jointly over their peoples. Once again, this was in favor of Juno, who was told of the fact that her favorite c
2 CONC ity would eventually be defeated by the Trojans' descendants. However, the messenger god Mercury was sent by Jupiter and Venus to remind Aeneas of his journey and his purpose, thus compelling him to l
2 CONC eave secretly and continue on his way. When Dido learned of this, she ordered a funeral pyre to be constructed for herself; and standing on it, she uttered a curse that forever would pit Carthage agai
2 CONC nst the Trojans. She then committed suicide by stabbing herself in the chest. When Aeneas later traveled to Hades, he called to her ghost but she neither spoke or acknowledged him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The company stopped on the island of Sicily during the course of their journey. There Aeneas was welcomed by Acestes, king of the region and son of the river Crinisus by a Dardanian woman. When the
2 CONC  ship left, Achaemenides, one of Odysseus' crew who had been left behind, traveled with them.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Soon after arriving in Italy, Aeneas made war against the city of Falerii. Latinus, king of the Latins, welcomed Aeneas's army of exiled Trojans and let them reorganize their life in Latium. His da
2 CONC ughter Lavinia had been promised to Turnus, king of the Rutuli, but Latinus received a prophecy that Lavinia would be betrothed to one from another land — namely, Aeneas. Latinus heeded the prophecy
2 CONC , and Turnus consequently declared war on Aeneas at the urging of Juno, who was aligned with King Tarchon of the Etruscans and Queen Amata of the Latins. Aeneas' forces prevailed. Turnus was killed an
2 CONC d his people were captured. According to Livy Aeneas was victorious but Latinus died in the war. Aeneas founded the of city Lavinium, named after his wife. He later welcomed Dido's sister, Anna Perenn
2 CONC a, who then committed suicide after learning of Lavinia's jealousy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After his death, his mother, Aphrodite asked Zeus to make her son immortal. Zeus agreed and the river god Numicius cleansed Aeneas of all his mortal parts and Aphrodite anointed him with Ambrosia a
2 CONC nd Nectar, making him a god. Aeneas was recognized as the god Indiges. Inspired by the work of James Frazer, some have posited that Aeneas was originally a life-death-rebirth deity.
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Family and legendary descendants</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aeneas had an extensive family tree. Aeneas' wet-nurse was named Caieta. He was the father of Ascanius with Creusa, and of Silvius with Lavinia. Ascanius, the son of Aeneas, also known as Iulus (or
2 CONC  Julius), founded Alba Longa and was the first in a long series of kings.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to the mythology outlined by Virgil in the Aeneid, Romulus and Remus were both descendants of Aeneas through their mother, and thus Aeneas was responsible for founding the Roman people. S
2 CONC ome early sources call him their father or grandfather [1], but, considering the commonly accepted dates of the fall of Troy (1184 BC) and the founding of Rome (753 BC), this seems unlikely.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Julian family (Gens Julia) of Rome, whose most famous member was Julius Caesar, traced their lineage to Aeneas's son Ascanius and, in turn, to the goddess Venus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The legendary kings of Britain also trace their family through a grandson of Aeneas, Brutus.

2 CONC e person as [https://www.geni.com/people/Iulus/6000000014835656244 Iulus], ancestor of Gens Iulia. According to Cato he left no descendants, being succeeded by his half-brother [https://www.geni.com/p

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>== Uncertain Mother ==</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sources differ about Ascanius' mother. According to Vergil he was son of Aeneas' by Aeneas' first wife [https://tinyurl.com/y7yfdru2 Creüsa]. According to Livy he was son of Aeneas by Aeneas' seco
2 CONC nd wife [https://www.geni.com/people/Lavinia/6000000007236179858 Lavinia]. These versions represent two different political claims. As son of the Latin princess Lavinia Ascanius would have been heir t
2 CONC o a part of the Latin kingdom in Italy. This is probably the older version, important when Rome was consolidating its hold over Italy. As son of the Trojan princess Creüsa Ascanius, and by proxy the 
2 CONC Romans, would have been heir to the Trojan kingdom. This is probably a newer version, important when Rome was expanding into Greece and the eastern Mediterranean.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>== Mythology ==</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Greek and Roman mythology, Ascanius was the son of the Trojan prince Aeneas and Creusa, daughter of Priam. After the Trojan War, as the city burned, Aeneas escaped to Latium in Italy, taking his
2 CONC  father Anchises and his child Ascanius with him, though Creusa died during the escape.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Ascanius' original name was Euryleon and this name was changed to Ascanius after his flight from Troy. According to Virgil, Ascanius was also called Iulus o
2 CONC r Julus. The Gens Julia, or the Julians, the clan to which Julius Caesar belonged, claimed to have been descended from Ascanius/Iulus, his father Aeneas, and, ultimately, the goddess Venus, the mother
2 CONC  of Aeneas in myth, his father being the mortal Anchises. According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, however, Julus was a son of Ascanius who disputed the succession of the kingdom of Alba Longa with Si
2 CONC lvius, upon the death of Ascanius.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to another legend mentioned by Livy, Ascanius may have been the son of Aeneas and Lavinia and thus born in Latium, not Troy. Ascanius later fought in the Italian Wars along with his fathe
2 CONC r Aeneas.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Aeneas, Ascanius became king of Lavinium and an Etruscan king named Mezentius took advantage of the occasion to besiege the city. Mezentius succeeded in making the city surrender
2 CONC  and agree to pay a yearly tribute. Upon his retirement, Ascanius fell upon him and his army unaware and entirely defeated Mezentius and killed his son Lausus. Mezentius was forced to agree to pay a y
2 CONC early tribute. Subsequent to this, exactly thirty years after the founding of Lavinium, Ascanius founded the city of Alba Longa and became its first king. He left his mother, Lavinia, in charge of the
2 CONC  city of Lavinium. Ascanius was succeeded by Silvius, who was either the younger brother of Ascanius or his son. Ascanius died in the 28th year of his reign.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Another tradition says Ascanius was too young to reign and that his mother Lavinia reigned in his stead for a number of years until he came of age, upon which, Ascanius founded Alba Longa and left 
2 CONC his mother in charge of Lavinium (Dionysius of Halicarnasus).

2 CONT <p>Agustus Caesar commissioned a literary work that Virgil wrote the Aeneid, concerning Ascanius. Virgil changed Ascanius name to Lulus. He also inserted the goddess Venus to become the mother of Aene
2 CONC as thus creating a new myth. This change in name from Ascanius to Lulus forced a link to the Julian family of Rome to earlier mythology. Augustus, (Octavian), was a member of the Julian family. After 
2 CONC Virgil fixed things, now Augustus could claim to have three major gods in his family tree, Venus, Jupiter and Mars.
2 CONT <p>Ascanius in the Aeneid used the phrase, Annua Coeptis, (Annuit Coeptis) which became the motto of the United States of America. Meaning, "He approves that which has been undertaken".
2 CONT <p>In any case, the story of Aeneas might have some value in regard to history and genealogy that's why I inserted their tree herein. Their story has survived through out the ages and came toi us via

2 CONC 1.47, 53), Ascanius became king of the land of Dascylitis after the Trojan war, but before long went back to Troy where he ruled after Aeneas' death. Strabo (13 p. 607) reports rather that Ascanius an

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hermes was born on Mount Cyllene in Arcadia to Maia. As the story is told in the Homeric Hymn, the Hymn to Hermes, Maia was a nymph, but Greeks generally applied the name to a midwife or a wise and
2 CONC  gentle old woman; so the nymph appears to have been an ancient one, or more probably a goddess. At any rate, she was one of the Pleiades, daughters of Atlas, taking refuge in a cave of Mount Cyllene 
2 CONC in Arcadia.

2 CONT <p>The infant Hermes was precocious. His first day he invented the lyre. By nightfall, he had rustled the immortal cattle of Apollo. For the first sacrifice, the taboos surrounding the sacred kine of 
2 CONC Apollo had to be transgressed, and the trickster god of boundaries was the one to do it.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hermes drove the cattle back to Greece and hid them, and covered their tracks. When Apollo accused Hermes, Maia said that it could not be him because he was with her the whole night. However, Zeus 
2 CONC entered the argument and said that Hermes did steal the cattle and they should be returned. While arguing with Apollo, Hermes began to play his lyre. The instrument enchanted Apollo and he agreed to l
2 CONC et Hermes keep the cattle in exchange for the lyre.

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} '''Creüsa''' (daughter of Priam and Hecuba) was married to Aeneas. She was left behind when Aeneas abandoned Troy. Their children are Ascanius and Etias.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Creusa's death at the will of the gods is dealt with briefly by Virgil in his ''Aeneid''. As Troy is falling to the Greeks, Aeneas goes to his home to lead his father Anchises, Creusa, and their so
2 CONC n Ascanius out of the city and into the countryside. Anchises refuses to leave the house, prompting Aeneas to decide that he will stay in Troy so that he may die honourably in battle, rather than aban
2 CONC don his father. Creusa grabs his feet and begs him to think of what would become of Ascanius, Anchises and herself if Aeneas were to be killed. As she does this, Ascanius catches fire with an un-earth
2 CONC ly flame. The flame is quickly doused with water. Anchises believes this to be an omen from Jupiter, who confirms this omen by sending a shooting star. Anchises now agrees to flee Troy. The family lea
2 CONC ves the home, Aeneas carrying his father and Ascanius holding his hand, while Creusa is to follow some distance behind them. As they flee through the city, they reach the gates and begin to run, after
2 CONC  noticing that the Greeks appear to be gaining on them. Creusa disappears, unable to keep up with them. After reaching Ceres’ temple outside of the city, Aeneas leaves Anchises and Ascanius there to
2 CONC  go back in search of Creusa. As he searches the city in desperation, he meets the shade, or ghost, of Creusa, who tells him that it was her fate to remain in Troy. She predicts his journey to Hesperi
2 CONC a, Italy and future marriage to another. She asks that Aeneas take care of their child and vanishes. Aeneas tries three times to hold her, each time failing to grasp her shade.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pausanias relates that Rhea and Aphrodite rescued Creusa from being enslaved by the Greeks on account of her being the wife of Aeneas (who was a son of Aphrodite).

2 CONT <p>Cassandra</p>
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Greek mythology, Cassandra ("she who entangles men") (also known as Alexandra) was a daughter of King Priam of Troy and his queen Hecuba, who captured the eye of Apollo and so was given the ability
2 CONC  to see the future. However, when she did not return his love, he placed a curse on her so that no one would ever believe her predictions. Thus Cassandra foresees the destruction of Troy (she warns th
2 CONC e Trojans about the Trojan Horse, the death of Agamemnon, and her own demise), but is unable to do anything about them. Coroebus and Othronus came to the aid of Troy out of love for Cassandra. Cassand
2 CONC ra was the first to see the body of her brother Hector being brought back to the city.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the Trojan War and after being raped by Ajax, Cassandra is taken as a concubine and sex slave by King Agamemnon of Mycenae. Unbeknownst to Agamemnon, while he was away at war, his wife, Clyte
2 CONC mnestra, had begun an affair with Aegisthus. Upon Agamemnon and Cassandra's arrival in Mycenae, Clytemnestra asked her husband to walk across a purple carpet; he initially refused then gave in and ent
2 CONC ered, not believing Cassandra's warnings. Clytemnestra and Aegisthus then murdered Agamemnon, and then Cassandra. Some information says that Cassandra and Agamemnon have twin boys Teledamus and Pelops
2 CONC , who are killed by Aegisthus.

2 CONC 3; Virgil. Aeneid II, 246-49.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In more modern literature, Cassandra has served as a very popular subject for tragedy and romance.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the Bible, the Prophet Jonah is the exact reverse of Cassandra: His prophecy is believed by everyone, but does not come true because the Ninevites repented, and thus God chose not to implement t
2 CONC he judgement that the prophecy was about, as Jonah had feared.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The fictional character Dr. Kathryn Railly, from the film Twelve Monkeys is an expert on people who suffer from Cassandra Syndrome - the belief in one's knowledge of the future but not having the p
2 CONC ower to do anything about it.

2 CONT <p>Cassandra is perhaps most remembered today as the prophetess who wasn't believed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There are many allusions to Cassandra's prophetic powers in literature, such as the one made by Propertius in Book III.14, poem XIII, of the Elegies.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(60) Frangitur ipsa suis Roma superba bonis. Certa loquor, sed nulla fides; neque vilia quondam verax Pergameis maenas habenda mali: sola Parim Phrygiae fatum componere, sola fallacem Troiae serper

2 CONC t [was useful] for her father: the futile speech proved the gods to be true.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hecuba, in Seneca's play Troades, also compares herself to Cassandra:</p>
2 CONT <p>(33) quidquid adversi accidit, quaecumque Phoebas ore lymphato furens credi deo vetante praedixit mala,  prior Hecuba vidi gravida nec tacui metus et vana vates ante Cassandram fui. Non cautus igne

2 CONC among you, nor the false Sinon. That fire is mine, by my torches you are burning.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cassandra was the daughter of Priam and Hecuba, and therefore was a princess of Troy.  When she was a young girl, she spent the night at the temple of Thymbraean Apollo with her twin brother, Helen
2 CONC us (Bell, 109). Robert Bell writes: "When their parents looked in on them the next morning, the children were entwined with serpents, which flicked their tongues into the children's ears. This enabled
2 CONC  Cassandra and Helenus to divine the future."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Once Cassandra had grown up, she again spent the night in Apollo's temple. This time, however, Apollo tried to force himself upon her. When she refused his advances, he cursed her in such a way tha
2 CONC t no one would believe her prophecies (although they would be true).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hyginus relates this story in Fabulae 65:</p>
2 CONT <p>Cassandra Priami et Hecubae filia in Apollinis fano ludendo lassa obdormisse dicitur; quam Apollo cum vellet comprimere, corporis copiam non fecit. Ob quam rem Apollo fecit, ut, cum vera caticinare
2 CONC tur, fidem nono haberet.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cassandra, daughter of Priam and Hecuba, in the temple of Apollo, exhausted from practicing, is said to have fallen asleep; whom, when Apollo wished to embrace her, she did not afford the opportuni
2 CONC ty of her body. On account of which thing, when she prophesied true things, she was not believed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Robert Bell notes that this curse stayed true throughout Cassandra's life except for on one occasion in which she declared Paris to be her brother when he arrived, as an adult, in Troy.  Cassandra 
2 CONC predicted the many misfortunes of Troy but, because of her curse, was not believed and Priam eventually locked her in a chamber, judging her insane.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the Aeneid, Aeneas laments letting the Trojan horse into the city, even though Cassandra had predicted it would bring the end to Troy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>(II.234) Dividimus muros et moenia pandimus urbis. Accingunt omnes operi, pedibusque rotarum subiciunt lapsus, et suppea vincula collo intendunt: scandit fatalis machina muros,  feta armis. Pueri c
2 CONC ircum innuptaeque puellae sacra canunt, funemque manu contingere gaudent. Illa subit, mediaeque minans illabitur urbi. O patria, O divum domus Ilium, et inculta bello moenia Dardanidum, quater ipso in
2 CONC  limine portae substitit, atque utero sonitum quater arma dedere: instamus tamen immemores caecique furore, et monstrum infelix sacrata sistimus arce. Tunc etiam fatis aperit Cassandra futuris ora, de
2 CONC i iussu non umquam credita Teucris. Nos delubra deum miseri, quibus ultimus esset ille dies, festa velamus fronde per urbem.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>We [of Troy] divide the walls and we spread open the defense of the city. They all make ready for labor, and they slide rollers under the feet [of the Trojan horse], and they slip chains of hemp on
2 CONC  the neck: the fateful machine scales the walls, full of armed men. The boys and the unmarried girls sing sacred songs all around, and they rejoice to touch the rope with hand. It (the horse) ascends 
2 CONC and, threatening, it glides into the middle of the city. O fatherland, O Illium, home of the divine, and the walls of the Dardanians renowned in war, four times [the horse] jarred at the threshold of 
2 CONC the gate, and four times from the belly the weapons gave a noise: nevertheless, we, heedless, pressed on blind with emotion, and we placed the unlucky monster on the sacred citadel. Then also Cassandr
2 CONC a opens her mouth with fates to come, by the order of the gods not ever believed by the Teucrians. Miserable we, for whom that day would be the last, covered the shrine of the gods with festal garland
2 CONC s through the city.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Troy fell, Cassandra sought shelter at the temple of Athena and she clung to Athena's statue. The "lesser" Ajax found her there and raped her, as Ovid mentions in Amores I.9:
2 CONT <p>(37) Summa ducum, Atrides, visa Priameide, fertur maenadis effusis obstipuisse comis.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The most distinguished leader of Atreus, having caught sight of the daughter of Priam, is said to have been awestruck by the streaming hair of a Maenad.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The "lesser" Ajax was then punished for this sacrilege. Edward Tripp writes:
2 CONT <p>Odysseus wanted Ajax stoned for thus angering the gods, but the Greeks did not dare to touch him, for he clung as a suppliant to the image which he had just desecrated. Athena enlisted the aid of Z
2 CONC eus and Poseidon to avenge the outrage. Together they caused the Greek fleet to be wrecked off Cape Caphareus, in southen Euboea. Some say that Athena struck Ajax dead with a thunderbolt, others that 
2 CONC Poseidon let him swim in safety to a huge rock called Gyrae. There the rash man boasted that he had saved himself in spite of any god. Poseidon thereupon split the rock with a thunderbolt, and Ajax wa
2 CONC s drowned. (Tripp, 32-33)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cassandra was given to Agamemnon as a spoil of war, and with him returned to Mycenae. She bore him twins, named Teledamus and Pelops.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Cassandra and Agamemnon returned to Mycenae, they were both murdered by Clytemnestra, Agamemnon's wife, and Aegisthus, Clytemnestra's lover. Aegisthus murdered both Teledamus and Pelops.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hyginus, in his Fabluae, suggests that Clytemnestra killed her husband and Cassandra at the prompting of Oeax, who told her that Cassandra was being brought as a concubine. Hyginus states that Oeax
2 CONC  did this in order to "avenge the injustices of his brother." Odysseus, wanting no part of the Trojan War, had pretended to be insane. Palamedes, Oeax's brother, exposed Odysseus' ruse and forced Odys
2 CONC seus to join the war. In doing so, Palamedes gained the wrath of Odysseus. To seek revenge, Odysseus framed Palamedes by making him out to be a traitor, and Agamemnon turned Palamedes over to the Gree
2 CONC k army to be stoned to death (Hornblower, 1099).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hyginus also suggests that Cassandra, in fact, was not being brought back as a concubine but, nonetheless, Clytemnestra planned the murders with Aegisthus. Hyginus writes:
2 CONT <p>Clytaemnestra Tyndarei filia Agamemnonis uxor cum audisset ab Oeace Palamedis fratre Cassandram sibi paelicem adduci, quod ementitus est, ut fratris iniurias exsequeretur, tunc Clytaemnestra cum Ae
2 CONC gistho filio Thyestis cepit consilium, ut Agamemnonem et Cassandram interficeret, quem sacrificantem securi cum Cassandra interfecerunt. At Electra Agamemnonis filia Orestem fratrem infantem sustulit,
2 CONC  quem demandavit in Phocide Strophio, cui fuit Astyochea Agamemnonis soror nupta.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Clytemnestra, daughter of Tyndareus and wife to Agamemnon, had heard from Oeax, brother of Palamedes, that Cassandra was to be brought as a concubine for Agamemnon, which [tale] Oeax fabricated in 
2 CONC order to avenge the injustices of his brother. Then Clytemnestra held council with Aegisthus, son of Thyestes, in order to kill Agamemnon and Cassandra, whom, while [Agamemnon was] sacrificing, with C
2 CONC assandra, they killed with an ax. But Electra, daughter of Agamemnon, lifted her infant brother Orestes, whom she entrusted to Strophius in Phocis, to whom Astyochea, sister of Agamemnon, was a bride.

2 CONT <p>(II.234) Dividimus muros et moenia pandimus urbis. Accingunt omnes operi, pedibusque rotarum subiciunt lapsus, et suppea vincula collo intendunt: scandit fatalis machina muros,  feta armis. Pueri c

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>We [of Troy] divide the walls and we spread open the defense of the city. They all make ready for labor, and they slide rollers under the feet [of the Trojan horse], and they slip chains of hemp on
2 CONC  the neck: the fateful machine scales the walls, full of armed men. The boys and the unmarried girls sing sacred songs all around, and they rejoice to touch the rope with hand. It (the horse) ascends 
2 CONC and, threatening, it glides into the middle of the city. O fatherland, O Illium, home of the divine, and the walls of the Dardanians renowned in war, four times [the horse] jarred at the threshold of 
2 CONC the gate, and four times from the belly the weapons gave a noise: nevertheless, we, heedless, pressed on blind with emotion, and we placed the unlucky monster on the sacred citadel. Then also Cassandr
2 CONC a opens her mouth with fates to come, by the order of the gods not ever believed by the Teucrians. Miserable we, for whom that day would be the last, covered the shrine of the gods with festal garland
2 CONC s through the city.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Troy fell, Cassandra sought shelter at the temple of Athena and she clung to Athena's statue. The "lesser" Ajax found her there and raped her, as Ovid mentions in Amores I.9:
2 CONT <p>(37) Summa ducum, Atrides, visa Priameide, fertur maenadis effusis obstipuisse comis.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The most distinguished leader of Atreus, having caught sight of the daughter of Priam, is said to have been awestruck by the streaming hair of a Maenad.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The "lesser" Ajax was then punished for this sacrilege. Edward Tripp writes:
2 CONT <p>Odysseus wanted Ajax stoned for thus angering the gods, but the Greeks did not dare to touch him, for he clung as a suppliant to the image which he had just desecrated. Athena enlisted the aid of Z
2 CONC eus and Poseidon to avenge the outrage. Together they caused the Greek fleet to be wrecked off Cape Caphareus, in southen Euboea. Some say that Athena struck Ajax dead with a thunderbolt, others that 
2 CONC Poseidon let him swim in safety to a huge rock called Gyrae. There the rash man boasted that he had saved himself in spite of any god. Poseidon thereupon split the rock with a thunderbolt, and Ajax wa
2 CONC s drowned. (Tripp, 32-33)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cassandra was given to Agamemnon as a spoil of war, and with him returned to Mycenae. She bore him twins, named Teledamus and Pelops.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Cassandra and Agamemnon returned to Mycenae, they were both murdered by Clytemnestra, Agamemnon's wife, and Aegisthus, Clytemnestra's lover. Aegisthus murdered both Teledamus and Pelops.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hyginus, in his Fabluae, suggests that Clytemnestra killed her husband and Cassandra at the prompting of Oeax, who told her that Cassandra was being brought as a concubine. Hyginus states that Oeax
2 CONC  did this in order to "avenge the injustices of his brother." Odysseus, wanting no part of the Trojan War, had pretended to be insane. Palamedes, Oeax's brother, exposed Odysseus' ruse and forced Odys
2 CONC seus to join the war. In doing so, Palamedes gained the wrath of Odysseus. To seek revenge, Odysseus framed Palamedes by making him out to be a traitor, and Agamemnon turned Palamedes over to the Gree
2 CONC k army to be stoned to death (Hornblower, 1099).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hyginus also suggests that Cassandra, in fact, was not being brought back as a concubine but, nonetheless, Clytemnestra planned the murders with Aegisthus. Hyginus writes:
2 CONT <p>Clytaemnestra Tyndarei filia Agamemnonis uxor cum audisset ab Oeace Palamedis fratre Cassandram sibi paelicem adduci, quod ementitus est, ut fratris iniurias exsequeretur, tunc Clytaemnestra cum Ae

2 CONC  quem demandavit in Phocide Strophio, cui fuit Astyochea Agamemnonis soror nupta.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Clytemnestra, daughter of Tyndareus and wife to Agamemnon, had heard from Oeax, brother of Palamedes, that Cassandra was to be brought as a concubine for Agamemnon, which [tale] Oeax fabricated in 
2 CONC order to avenge the injustices of his brother. Then Clytemnestra held council with Aegisthus, son of Thyestes, in order to kill Agamemnon and Cassandra, whom, while [Agamemnon was] sacrificing, with C
2 CONC assandra, they killed with an ax. But Electra, daughter of Agamemnon, lifted her infant brother Orestes, whom she entrusted to Strophius in Phocis, to whom Astyochea, sister of Agamemnon, was a bride.

2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Greek mythology, Poseidon (Greek: Ποσειδῶν; Latin: Neptūnus) was the god of the sea and, as "Earth-Shaker," of earthquakes. The name of the god Nethuns in Etruscan was adopted in Latin
2 CONC  for Neptune in Roman mythology: both were sea gods analogous to Poseidon. Linear B tablets show that Poseidon was venerated at Pylos and Thebes in pre-Olympian Bronze Age Greece, but he was integrate
2 CONC d into the Olympian gods as the brother of Zeus and Hades.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidon was a major civic god of several cities: in Athens, he was second only to Athena in importance; while in Corinth and many cities of Magna Graecia he was the chief god of the polis. In his 
2 CONC benign aspect, Poseidon was seen as creating new islands and offering calm seas. When offended or ignored, he supposedly struck the ground with his trident and caused chaotic springs, earthquakes, dro
2 CONC wnings and shipwrecks. Sailors prayed to Poseidon for a safe voyage, sometimes drowning horses as a sacrifice.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Pausanias, Poseidon was one of the caretakers of the oracle at Delphi before Olympian Apollo took it over. Apollo and Poseidon worked closely in many realms: in colonization, for examp
2 CONC le, Delphic Apollo provided the authorization to go out and settle, while Poseidon watched over the colonists on their way, and provided the lustral water for the foundation-sacrifice. Xenophon's Anab
2 CONC asis describes a group of Spartan soldiers in 400-399 BCE singing to Poseidon a paean - a kind of hymn normally sung for Apollo.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Like Dionysus, who inflamed the maenads, Poseidon also caused certain forms of mental disturbance. A Hippocratic text of ca 400 BCE, On the Sacred Disease says that he was blamed for certain types 
2 CONC of epilepsy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The name seems to rather transparently stem from Greek pósis "lord, husband" with a less-transparent -don element, perhaps from dea, "goddess'. If surviving Linear B clay tablets can be trusted, t
2 CONC he name PO-SE-DA-WO-NE ("Poseidon") occurs with greater frequency than does DI-U-JA (Zeus). A feminine variant, PO-SE-DE-IA, is also found, indicating a lost consort goddess, in effect a precursor of 
2 CONC Amphitrite. Tablets from Pylos record sacrificial goods destined for "the Two Queens and Poseidon" and to "the Two Queens and the King". The most obvious identification for the "Two Queens" is with De
2 CONC meter and Persephone, or their precursors, goddesses who were not associated with Poseidon in later periods. Poseidon is already identified as "Earth-Shaker"— E-NE-SI-DA-O-NE— in Mycenaean Knossos
2 CONC , a powerful attribute where earthquakes had accompanied the collapse of the Minoan palace-culture. In the heavily sea-dependent Mycenean culture, no connection between Poseidon and the sea has yet su
2 CONC rfaced; among the Olympians it was determined by lot that he should rule over the sea (Hesiod, Theogony 456): the god preceded his realm.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demeter and Poseidon's names are linked in one Pylos tablet, where they appear as PO-SE-DA-WO-NE and DA, referred to by the epithets Enosichthon, Seischthon and Ennosigaios, all meaning "earth-shak
2 CONC er" and referring to his role in causing earthquakes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidon was a son of Cronus and Rhea. In most accounts he is swallowed by Cronus at birth but later saved, with his other brothers and sisters, by Zeus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However in some versions of the story, he, like his brother Zeus, did not share the fate of his other brother and sisters who were eaten by Cronus. He was saved by his mother Rhea, who concealed hi
2 CONC m among a flock of lambs and pretended to have given birth to a colt, which she gave to Cronus to devour. According to John Tzetzes the kourotrophos, or nurse of Poseidon was Arne, who denied knowing 
2 CONC where he was, when Cronus came searching; according to Diodorus Siculus Poseidon was raised by the Telchines on Rhodes, just as Zeus was raised by the Korybantes on Crete.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to a single reference in the Iliad, when the world was divided by lot in three, Zeus received the sky, Hades the underworld and Poseidon the sea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Athena became the patron goddess of the city of Athens after a competition with Poseidon. Yet Poseidon remained a numinous presence on the Acropolis in the form of his surrogate, Erechtheus. At the
2 CONC  dissolution festival at the end of the year in the Athenian calendar, the Skira, the priests of Athena and the priest of Poseidon would process under canopies to Eleusis. They agreed that each would 
2 CONC give the Athenians one gift and the Athenians would choose whichever gift they preferred. Poseidon struck the ground with his trident and a spring sprang up; the water was salty and not very useful, w
2 CONC hereas Athena offered them an olive tree.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Athenians (or their king, Cecrops) accepted the olive tree and along with it Athena as their patron, for the olive tree brought wood, oil and food. After the fight, infuriated at his loss, Pose
2 CONC idon sent a monstrous flood to the Attic Plain, to punish the Athenians for not choosing him. The depression made by Poseidon's trident and filled with salt water was surrounded by the northern hall o
2 CONC f the Erechtheum, remaining open to the air. "In cult, Poseidon was identified with Erechtheus," Walter Burkert noted. "the myth turns this into a temporal-causal sequence: in his anger at losing, Pos
2 CONC eidon led his son Eumolpus against Athens and killed Erectheus."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The contest of Athena and Poseidon was the subject of the reliefs on the western pediment of the Parthenon, the first sight that greeted the arriving visitor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This myth is construed by Robert Graves and others as reflecting a clash between the inhabitants during Mycenaean times and newer immigrants. It is interesting to note that Athens at its height was
2 CONC  a significant sea power, at one point defeating the Persian fleet at Salamis Island in a sea battle
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidon and Apollo, having offended Zeus, were sent to serve King Laomedon of Troy. He had them build huge walls around the city and promised to reward them well, a promise he then refused to fulf
2 CONC ill. In vengeance, before the Trojan War, Poseidon sent a sea monster to attack Troy (it was later killed by Perseus).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His consort was Amphitrite, a nymph and ancient sea-goddess, daughter of Nereus and Doris.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidon was the father of many heroes. He is thought to have fathered the famed Theseus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A mortal woman named Tyro was married to Cretheus (with whom she had one son, Aeson) but loved Enipeus, a river god. She pursued Enipeus, who refused her advances. One day, Poseidon, filled with lu
2 CONC st for Tyro, disguised himself as Enipeus, and from their union were born the heroes Pelias and Neleus, twin boys. Poseidon also had an affair with Alope, his granddaughter through Cercyon, begetting 
2 CONC the Attic hero Hippothoon. Cercyon had his daughter buried alive but Poseidon turned her into the spring, Alope, near Eleusis.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidon rescued Amymone from a lecherous satyr and then fathered a child, Nauplius, by her.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After having raped Caeneus, Poseidon fulfilled her request and changed her into a male warrior.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Not all of Poseidon's children were human. In an archaic myth, Poseidon once pursued Demeter. She spurned his advances, turning herself into a mare so that she could hide in a herd of horses; he sa
2 CONC w through the deception and became a stallion and captured her. Their child was a horse, Arion, which was capable of human speech. Poseidon also had sexual intercourse with Medusa on the floor of a te
2 CONC mple to Athena.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Medusa was then changed into a monster by Athena. When she was later beheaded by the hero Perseus, Chrysaor and Pegasus emerged from her neck. There is also Triton, the merman; Polyphemus, the cycl
2 CONC ops; and Oto and Ephialtae, the giants.

2 CONT <p>Poseidon was known in various guises, denoted by epithets. In the town of Aegae in Euboea, he was known as Poseidon Aegaeus and had a magnificent temple upon a hill. Poseidon also had a close assoc

2 CONT <p>Poseidon</p>
2 CONT <p>Havets gud, även kallad Jordskakaren, eftersom han också ansågs orsaka jordbävningar. Poseidon var son till Kronos och Rhea, och var bror till Zeus och Hades. Han var Amfitrites make, och med h
2 CONC enne hade han sonen Triton. Han hade ockå barn med sina många älskarinnor, till exempel cykloperna, Pegasus, Theseus och Orion.
2 CONT <p>Ursprungligen var Poseidon vattnets gud, men han blev senare en havsgud och flodernas och källorna yttersta härskare. Hans tempel låg ofta nära havet, och ruinerna av ett kan ses i Kap Sounion,
2 CONC  inte långt ifrån Athen. Han var också Jonernas beskyddare.
2 CONT <p>I konsten avbildades Poseidon med en treudd och hans djur var delfinen.</p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidon var också hästarnas gud, och de antika grekerna offrade hästar åt honom och sänkte dem i havet. Han var också associerad med tjurar.  Under det trojanska kriget stod han på grekerna
2 CONC s sida eftersom en av Trojas kungar hade vägrat betala honom då han byggt stadens mur. Han var dock Odysseus fiende efter att denne dödat hans son Polyfemos cyklopen.
2 CONT <p>Poseidon hade velat bli Athens skyddsgud, och i en tävling mot Athena hade han gett athenarna en källa, som tyvärr visade sig vara salt. Han förlorade därmed mot Athena, som gett folket olivtr
2 CONC ädet.
2 CONT <p>De gamla grekerna firade Poseidon med de Isthmiska spelen som höll vartannat år.  I romersk mytologi kallades Poseidon Neptunus.

2 CONT <p>En la mitología griega, Poseidón o Posidón (en griego antiguo Ποσειδῶν) era el dios del mar, así como de los caballos y, como «Agitador de la Tierra», de los terremotos. Elnombre del
2 CONC  dios marino etrusco Nethuns fue adoptado en latín para Neptuno
2 CONT <p> (Neptunus) en la mitología romana, siendo ambos análogos a Poseidón. Las inscripciones en lineal B muestran que Poseidón fue venerado en Pilos y Tebas en la Grecia micénica de finales dela Ed
2 CONC ad del Bronce, pero fue integrado en el panteón olímp
2 CONT <p>ico posterior como hermano de Zeus y Hades. Poseidón tuvo muchos hijos y fue protector de muchas ciudades helenas, aunque perdió el concurso por Atenas contra Atenea. Le fue dedicado un himno hom

2 CONT <p>Poseidón era un importante dios municipal de varias ciudades: en Atenas, era el segundo en importancia por detrás solo de Atenea, mientras en Corinto y en muchas ciudades de la Magna Grecia era e
2 CONC l dios jefe de la polis.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En su aspecto benigno, Poseidón se concebía creando nuevas islas y ofreciendo mares en calma. Cuando se enfadaba o era ignorado, hendía el suelo con su tridente y provocaba manantiales caóticos
2 CONC , terremotos, hundimientos y naufragios. En La Odisea
2 CONT <p>, su rencor hacia Odiseo impidió a éste regresar a su hogar en Ítaca. Los marineros oraban a Poseidón para tener un viaje seguro, a veces ahogando caballos como sacrificio.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Según Pausanias, Poseidón fue uno de los guardianes del oráculo de Delfos antes de que el olímpico Apolo le sustituyese. Apolo y Poseidón colaboraban estrechamente en muchos ámbitos: en la co
2 CONC lonización, por ejemplo, Apolo Délfico daba la autoriza
2 CONT <p>ción para partir y asentarse, mientras Poseidón cuidaba de los colonizadores en su viaje y proporcionaba el agua purificadora para el sacrificio fundacional. En su Anábasis, Jenofonte describen 
2 CONC a un grupo de soldados espartanos en 400–399 adC can
2 CONT <p>tando un peán a Poseidón, un tipo de himno destinado normalmente a Apolo.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Como Dioniso, que enfervorizaba a las Ménades, Poseidón también provocaba ciertas formas de perturbación mental. Un texto hipocrático de c. 400 adC, Sobre la enfermedad sagrada, afirma que era
2 CONC  considerado culpable de ciertos tipos de epilepsia.

2 CONT <p>Prehistoria editar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>El nombre «Poseidón» parece proceder bastante claramente del griego pósis, ‘señor’, ‘marino’, con un elemento -don menos claro, quizá de dea, ‘diosa’. Si se da crédito a las tabl
2 CONC illas en lineal B que se conservan, el nombre PO-SE-DA-WO-NE (Poseid
2 CONT <p>ón) aparece con mayor frecuencia que DI-U-JA (Zeus). También aparece una variante femenina, PO-SE-DE-IA, lo que indica la existencia de una diosa consorte olvidada, precursora en efecto de Anfít
2 CONC rite. Las tablillas de Pilos registran mercancías de
2 CONT <p>stinadas a sacrificios para «las Dos Reinas y Poseidón» y «las Dos Reinas y el Rey». La identificación más obvia para las «Dos Reinas» es con Deméter y Perséfone o sus precursoras, diosa
2 CONC sque no quedaron asociadas con Poseidón en periodos posteri
2 CONT <p>ores. Poseidón es también identificado como E-NE-SI-DA-O-NE (‘agitador de la tierra’) en el Cnosos micénico,1 un poderoso atributo donde los terremotos habían acompañado al colapso de la c
2 CONC ultura palaciega minoica. En la cultura micénica, fuerteme
2 CONT <p>nte dependiente del mar, no ha aflorado aún relación alguna entre Poseidón y el mar entre los olímpicos se decidió tras echarlo a suertes que gobernaría el mar:2 el dios era anterior a surein
2 CONC o.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Los nombres de Deméter y Poseidón están relacionados en una tablilla de Pilos, donde aparecen como PO-SE-DA-WO-NE y DA-MA-TE, en el contexto sagrado de echar a suertes. En una etimología,cita r
2 CONC equerida el elemento DA que aparece en ambos nombres
2 CONT <p> estaría relacionado con una raíz protoindoeuropea relacionada con la distribución de tierras y honores (compárese con el latín dare, ‘dar’), por lo que «Poseidón» significaría aproxim
2 CONC adamente ‘señor distribuidor’ o ‘consorte de la distribuidora’
2 CONT <p>, en correspondencia con «Deméter», ‘madre distribuidora’. Walter Burkert considera que «el segundo elemento DA permanece desesperadamente ambiguo» y encuentra la interpretación ‘consor
2 CONC tede la Tierra’ «bastante imposible de demostrar».3
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dada la relación de Poseidón con los caballos así como con el mar, y la alejada situación respecto al mar del probable territorio original indoeuropeo, algunos investigadores han propuesto que 
2 CONC Poseidón era originalmente un aristocrático dios-caba
2 CONT <p>llo que fue posteriormente asimilado con las deidades acuáticas de Oriente Próximo cuando la base del sustento griego cambió de la tierra al mar.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En cualquier caso, la enorme importancia inicial de Poseidón puede aún entreverse en La Odisea de Homero, donde es él y no Zeus el principal causante de los sucesos.

2 CONT <p>Poseidón era un hijo de Crono y Rea. En la mayoría de las versiones fue tragado por Crono al nacer, pero algunas, al igual que Zeus, evitó el destino de sus demás hermanos al ser salvado por su
2 CONC  madre, que le ocultó en un rebaño de corderos simula
2 CONT <p>ndo haber parido un potro, que dio a Crono para que lo devorase.4 Según Tzetzés la curótrofa o niñera de Poseidón fue Arne, quien negó serlo cuando Crono apareció buscándola.5 Según Diodor
2 CONC o Sículo, Poseidón fue criado por los Telquines en Rodas,
2 CONT <p> igual que Zeus había sido criado por los Coribantes en Creta.6</p>

2 CONT <p>Según una única referencia en La Ilíada, cuando el mundo fue dividido en tres, Zeus recibió la tierra y el cielo, Hades el inframundo y Poseidón el mar.

2 CONT <p>La fundación de Atenas editar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Atenea se convirtió en la diosa patrona de la ciudad de Atenas tras competir con Poseidón. Ambos acordaron que cada uno haría un regalo a los atenienses y que éstos elegirían el que prefiriese
2 CONC n. Poseidón golpeó el suelo con su tridente e hizo bro
2 CONT <p>tar una fuente, pero su agua era salada y por tanto no muy útil, mientras que Atenea ofreció un olivo.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Los atenienses (o mejor dicho su rey, Cécrope) escogieron el olivo y con él a Atenea como patrona, pues el árbol daba madera, aceite y alimento. Tras esto, enfurecido por su derrota, Poseidón e
2 CONC nvió una monstruosa inundación a la llanura ática, ca
2 CONT <p>stigando así a los atenienses.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Este mito es considerado por Graves y otros autores como el reflejo de un enfrentamiento entre los habitantes de la época micénica y los inmigrantes posteriores. Resulta interesante señalar que 
2 CONC en su culmen Atenas fue una importante potencia marí
2 CONT <p>tima, llegando a derrotar a la flota persa en la batalla de Salamina. Otra versión del mito cuenta que Poseidón dio caballos a Atenas.

2 CONT <p>Las murallas de Troya editar</p>

2 CONT <p>Poseidón y Apolo, habiendo ofendido a Zeus, fueron enviados a servir al rey Laomedonte. Éste les pidió construir enormes murallas alrededor de la ciudad y prometió recompensarles generosamente,
2 CONC  promesa que luego se negó a cumplir. En venganza, an

2 CONT <p>Su esposa era Anfítrite, una ninfa y antigua diosa del mar, hija de Nereo y Doris. Poseidón fue padre de muchos héroes, entre ellos el afamado Teseo.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Una mujer mortal llamada Tiro estaba casada con Creteo (con quien tenía un hijo, Aesón) pero amaba a Enipeo, un dios-río. Tiro perseguía a Enipeo, que rehuía sus avances. Un día Poseidón,lle
2 CONC no de deseo hacia Tiro, se disfrazó como Enipeo y de su
2 CONT <p> unión con ella nacieron los héroes Pelias y Neleo. Poseidón también tuvo una aventura con Álope, su nieta por Cerción, de la que nació el héroe ático Hipotoonte. Cerción enterró viva a 
2 CONC su hija pero Poseidón la convirtió en una fuente cerca de El
2 CONT <p>eusis.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidón rescató a Amimone de un sátiro lujurioso y entonces tuvo un hijo con ella, Nauplio. Tras violar a Cene, Poseidón le concedió el deseo de convertirse en hombre.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>No todos los hijos de Poseidón fueron humanos. En un mito arcaico, Poseidón persiguió una vez a Deméter. Ésta rechazó sus avances, transformándose en una yegua para poder esconderse en unreb
2 CONC año de caballos, pero Poseidón advirtió el engaño, se c
2 CONT <p>onvirtió en un semental y la raptó. El hijo de ambos fue un caballo, Arión, que tenía el don de la palabra. Poseidón también violó a Medusa en el suelo de un templo consagrado a Atenea. Medu
2 CONC sa fue entonces transformada en un monstruo. Cuando más
2 CONT <p> tarde fue decapitada por Perseo, Crisaor y Pegaso emergieron de su cuello. Otros descendientes de Poseidón fueron Tritón, el cíclope Polifemo y los Alóadas.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidón se enamoró de Pélope, un hermoso joven, hijo de Tántalo. Llevó a Pélope al Olimpo y le hizo su amante, antes incluso de que Zeus hiciese lo mismo con Ganimedes. Para agradecer a Pél
2 CONC ope su amor, Poseidón le regaló más tarde un carro alado

2 CONT <p>En el período histórico, era frecuente referirse a Poseidón por los epítetos Enosichthon, Seischthon y Ennosigeo, significando todos ‘agitador de la tierra’ y aludiendo a su papel como caus

2 CONT <p>En el arte griego, Poseidón conduce un carro tirado por un Hipocampo o por caballos que podían cabalgar sobre el mar. Estaba asociado con los delfines y las lanzas de pescar de tres dientes (trid

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En La Odisea, Poseidón destaca por su odio hacia Odiseo, debido a que éste había cegado a su hijo el cíclope Polifemo. La enemistad del dios impide a Odiseo volver a su hogar en Ítaca durante

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} In Greek mythology the sun was personified as Helios (pronounced /ˈhiliˌɑs/) (Greek: Ἥλιος, Latinized as Helius). Homer often calls him simply Titan or Hyperion, while Hesiod 
2 CONC (Theogony 371) and the Homeric Hymn separate him as a son of the Titans Hyperion and Theia (Hesiod) or Euryphaessa (Homeric Hymn) and brother of the goddesses Selene, the moon, and Eos, the dawn. The 
2 CONC names of these three were also the common Greek words for sun, moon and dawn.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Helios was imagined as a handsome god crowned with the shining aureole of the sun, who drove the chariot of the sun across the sky each day to earth-circling Oceanus and through the world-ocean ret
2 CONC urned to the East at night. Homer described Helios's chariot as drawn by solar steeds (Iliad xvi.779); later Pindar described it as drawn by "fire-darting steeds" (Olympian Ode 7.71). Still later, the
2 CONC  horses were given fiery names: Pyrios, Aeos, Aethon, and Phlegon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As time passed, Helios was increasingly identified with the god of light, Apollo. The equivalent of Helios in Roman mythology was Sol, specifically Sol Invictus.

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecuba):</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"Hecuba (also Hekabe; Ancient Greek: Ἑκάβη) was a queen in Greek mythology, the wife of King Priam of Troy, with whom she had 19 children. She was of Phrygian birth; her father was Dymas, and
2 CONC  her mother (Eunoë) was said to be a daughter of Sangarius, god of the Sangarius River, the principal river of ancient Phrygia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the Iliad, Hecuba appears as the mother of Hector, and laments his death in a well-known speech in Book 24 of the epic.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>With the god Apollo, Hecuba had a son named Troilus. An oracle prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive. He was killed by Achilles during the Tr
2 CONC ojan War.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Polydorus, Priam's youngest son by Hecuba, was sent with gifts of jewelry and gold to the court of King Polymestor to keep him safe during the Trojan War. The fighting grew vicious and Priam was fr
2 CONC ightened for the child's safety. After Troy fell, Polymestor threw Polydorus to his death to take the treasure for himself. Hecuba, though she was enslaved by the Achaeans when the city fell, eventual
2 CONC ly avenged her son, blinding Polymestor and killing his children.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In another tradition, Hecuba went insane upon seeing the corpses of her children Polydorus and Polyxena. Dante described this episode, which he derived from Italian sources:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    E quando la fortuna volse in basso</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    l'altezza de' Troian che tutto ardiva,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    sì che 'nsieme col regno il re fu casso,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    Ecuba trista, misera e cattiva,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    poscia che vide Polissena morta,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    e del suo Polidoro in su la riva</p>
2 CONT <p></p>

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    forsennata latrò sì come cane...</p>

2 CONT <p>    And when fortune overturned the pride</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    of the Trojans, who dared everything, so that</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    both the king and his kingdom were destroyed,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    Poor wretched captured Hecuba,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    after she saw her Polyxena dead</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    and found her Polydorus on the beach,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    was driven mad by sorrow</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    and began barking like a dog...</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>~ Inferno XXX: 13-20</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A third story says that she was given to Odysseus as a slave, but as she snarled and cursed at him, the gods turned her into a dog, allowing her to escape.

2 CONT <p>Hecuba (also Hekábe, Hecabe, Hécube; Ancient Greek: Ἑκάβη) was a queen in Greek mythology, the wife of King Priam of Troy, with whom she had 19 children. The most famous of her children was
2 CONC  Hector of Troy. She was of Phrygian birth; her father was Dymas, and her mother Eunoë was said to be a daughter of Sangarius, god of the Sangarius River, the principal river of ancient Phrygia.

2 CONT <p>In the Iliad, Hecuba appears as the mother of Hector, and laments his death in a well-known speech in Book 24 of the epic.

2 CONT <p>With the god Apollo, Hecuba had a son named Troilus. An oracle prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive. He was killed by Achilles during the Tr

2 CONT <p>Polydorus, Priam's youngest son by Hecuba, was sent with gifts of jewelry and gold to the court of King Polymestor to keep him safe during the Trojan War. The fighting grew vicious and Priam was fr

2 CONT <p>In another tradition, Hecuba went insane upon seeing the corpses of her children Polydorus and Polyxena. Dante described this episode, which he derived from Italian sources:

2 CONT <p>Priam (Podarces)  </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Being the only son of Laomedon to survive a war against Heracles, he was ransomed by his sister, and he became king of Troy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His first wife was Arisbe, daughter of Merops, king of Percote. They had a son, Aesacus, who was a gifted seer. Priam soon married Hecuba, daughter of Dymas. With Hecuba, he became father of Hector
2 CONC , Paris, Cassandra, Helenus and many other children (some say as many as fifty, by some other women as well as Hecuba). Before Paris was born, Hecuba had a vision, that the seer interpreted that Paris
2 CONC  would one-day causes the destruction of Troy. Priam had his second son by Hecuba, exposed in the wild.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He was ally of Mygdonians and fought the Amazons, in his youth. Years later, Paris returned to Troy and was recognised. Their parents had forgotten the warning by the seer (possibly Aesacus) and we
2 CONC lcome him home.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When three goddesses asked Paris to judge and award the golden apple to the fairest goddess, he awarded the apple to goddess of love, Aphrodite. Aphrodite promised him the fairest woman, Helen of S
2 CONC parta. This would result in the outbreak of war between the Greeks and the Trojans.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Priam would have return Helen, when Greek embassy demanded the return of Helen to her husband Menelaüs (Menelaus). But Paris prevailed upon his father to refuse. As a result the war lasted for ten
2 CONC  years and all but one son would die in the war. His son, Helenus, also a seer, would be the only son to survive the war. Hecuba all his daughter became enslaved. Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, would k

2 CONT <p>In Greek mythology, Priam (Greek ???aµ??) was the king of Troy during the Trojan War, and son of Laomedon. Priam had a number of wives (his first was Arisbe); his chief wife, Hecuba, bore him twen
2 CONC ty children. Another wife, Laothoe, was the mother of Lycaon. He also fathered Cebriones with a slave. Priam was originally called Podarge (or Podarces) and he kept himself from being killed by Heracl
2 CONC es by giving him a golden veil embroidered by his sister, Hesione. After this, Podarge changed his name to Priam. This is an aitiological popular etymology based on priatos "ransomed"; the actual etym
2 CONC ology of the name is probably not Greek, a Lydian origin was suggested.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Polydorus, Priam's youngest son, was sent with gifts of jewelry and gold to the court of King Polymestor to keep him safe during the Trojan War. The fighting grew vicious and Priam was frightened f

2 CONT <p>When Hector was killed by Achilles, Priam walked into the Greek encampment and begged for Hector's body so he could be buried. Achilles agreed, though he had already dragged the body around Troy th

2 CONT <p>In Greek mythology, Priam was the king of Troy during the Trojan War, and youngest son of Laomedon. Priam had a number of wives; his first was Arisbe, daughter of Merops of Percote. Priam divorced 
2 CONC Arisbe to marry Hecuba (Hecabe), daughter of the Phrygian king Dymas, who became his principal wife.
2 CONT <p>By his various wives and concubines Priam was the father of fifty sons and several daughters. Priam's eldest son was Aesacus, his son by Arisbe; Aesacus met a tragic death before the advent of the 
2 CONC Trojan War. Hector was Priam's eldest son by Hecuba, and Priam's favorite. Aside from Hector, Hecuba bore other sons to Priam - Paris, Deiphobus, Helenus, Pammon, Polites, Antiphus, Hipponous, and Pol
2 CONC ydorus, among others - as well as many daughters - including Ilione, Creusa, Laodice, Polyxena, and Cassandra. By other women, Priam had many other sons (Melanippus, Gorgythion, Philaemon, Hippothous,

2 CONC lodorus, who does not provide the name of the mother for most of these children. However, Homer (Iliad) says that Laothoe, daughter of the Lelegian king Altes, bore two sons to Priam, named Lycaon and
2 CONC  Polydorus; and that Gorgythion was Priam's son by Castianeira of Aesyme. Polydorus was actually the name of two sons of Priam, one a warrior at the time of the Trojan War, the other a child (see belo
2 CONC w).

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Tethys (mythology)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Classical Greek mythology, Tethys (Greek Τηθύς), daughter of Uranus and Gaia (Hesiod, Theogony lines 136, 337 and Bibliotheke 1.2) is an aquatic sea goddess. Tethys was both sister and wife
2 CONC  of Oceanus.[1] She was mother of the chief rivers of the world known to the Greeks, such as the Nile, the Alpheus, the Maeander, and about three thousand daughters called the Oceanids.[2] Considered 
2 CONC as an embodiment of the waters of the world she also may be seen as a counterpart of Thalassa, the embodiment of the sea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although these vestiges imply a strong role in earlier times, Tethys plays virtually no part in recorded Greek literary texts, or historical records of Greek religion or cults. Walter Burkert[3] no
2 CONC tes the presence of Tethys in the episode of Iliad XIV that the Ancients called the "Deception of Zeus", where Hera, to mislead Zeus, says she wants to go to Oceanus, "origin of the gods" and Tethys "
2 CONC the mother". Burkert [4] sees in the name a transformation of Akkadian tiamtu or tâmtu, "the sea," which is recognizable in Tiamat.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>One of the few representations of Tethys that is identified securely by an accompanying inscription is the Late Antique (fourth century CE) mosaic from the flooring of a thermae at Antioch, now at 
2 CONC Dumbarton Oaks, in Washington, D.C.[5] In the Dumbarton Oaks mosaic, the bust of Tethys—surrounded by fishes—is rising, bare-shouldered from the waters. Against her shoulder rests a golden ship's 
2 CONC rudder. Gray wings sprout from her forehead, as in the mosaics illustrated above and below.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the war against the Titans, Tethys raised Rhea as her god-child, but there are no records of active cults for Tethys in historic times.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tethys has sometimes been confused [6] with another sea goddess who became the sea-nymph Thetis, the wife of Peleus and mother of Achilles during Classical times. Some myths imply a second generati
2 CONC on relationship between the two, a grandmother and granddaughter.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Indicative of the power exercised by Tethys, one myth[7] relates that the prominent goddess of the Olympians, Hera, was not pleased with the placement of Callisto and Arcas in the sky, as the const
2 CONC ellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, so she asked her nurse, Tethys, to help. Tethys, a marine goddess, caused the constellations forever to circle the sky and never drop below the horizon, hence expl
2 CONC aining why they are circumpolar. Robert Graves interprets the use of the term nurse in Classical myths as identifying deities who once were goddesses of central importance in the periods before histor
2 CONC ical documentation.[8]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tethys, a moon of the planet Saturn, and the prehistoric Tethys Ocean are named after this goddess.

2 CONT <p>Okeanos was depicted in ancient Greek vase painting as a bull-horned god with the tail of a serpentine fish in place of legs, similar to his river-god sons. His usual attributes were a fish and ser

2 CONT <p>In classical antiquity, Oceanus (from Greek: Ὠκεανός, lit. "ocean") was believed to be the world-ocean, which the ancient Romans and Greeks considered to be an enormous river encircling the
2 CONC  world. Strictly speaking, Oceanus was the ocean-stream at the Equator  in which floated the habitable hemisphere (oikoumene οἰκουμένη). In Greek mythology, this world-ocean was personified 
2 CONC as a Titan, a son of Uranus and Gaia. In Hellenistic and Roman mosaics, this Titan was often depicted as having the upper body of a muscular man with a long beard and horns (often represented as the c
2 CONC laws of a crab), and the lower torso of a serpent (cf. Typhon). On a fragmentary archaic vessel (British Museum 1971.11-1.1) of ca 580 BC, among the gods arriving at the wedding of Peleus and the sea-
2 CONC nymph Thetis, is a fish-tailed Oceanus, with a fish in one hand and a serpent in the other, gifts of bounty and prophecy. In Roman mosaics he might carry a steering-oar and cradle a ship.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Some scholars believe that Oceanus originally represented all bodies of salt water, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, the two largest bodies known to the ancient Greeks. Howev
2 CONC er, as geography became more accurate, Oceanus came to represent the stranger, more unknown waters of the Atlantic Ocean (also called the "Ocean Sea"), while the newcomer of a later generation, Poseid
2 CONC on, ruled over the Mediterranean.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Oceanus' consort is his sister Tethys, and from their union came the ocean nymphs, also known as the three-thousand Oceanids, and all the rivers of the world, fountains, and lakes. From Cronus, of 
2 CONC the race of Titans, the Olympian gods have their birth, and Hera mentions twice in Iliad book xiv her intended journey "to the ends of the generous earth on a visit to Oceanus, whence the gods have ri

2 CONT <p>Daughter of Atlas and Pleione. She was one of seven daughters who were sodistressed at the death of the Hyades that they killed themselves. Zeusplaced them in the sky as a cluster of seven stars th
2 CONC e Plaiades. It issaid that the faintest of these stars is Electra, grieving for the fateof her sons city, Troy. Some sources suggest that it was Corythus and notZeus who was the father of her son Dard
2 CONC anus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En la mitología griega, Electra (en griego antiguo Ἠλέκτρα Êléktra) o Laódice era, de acuerdo con la narración homérica, hija de Agamenón y Clitemnestra. Estaba ausente de Micenas cu
2 CONC ando su padre regresó de la Guerra de Troya y fue asesinado (jun
2 CONT <p>to con Casandra, su concubina) por Egisto, el amante de Clitemnestra o por la misma Clitemnestra.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ocho años más tarde, Electra regresó de Atenas con su hermano, Orestes. Según Píndaro, a Orestes lo salvaron su vieja nodriza o Electra, que lo llevaron a Fanote, tras el monte Parnaso, donde 
2 CONC lo confiaron al rey Estrofo.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cuando cumplió veinte años, el oráculo en Delfos ordenó a Orestes que regresara a su patria y vengara la muerte de su padre. Según Esquilo, se encontró con Electra ante la tumba de Agamenón,
2 CONC  donde ambos habían ido a rendir honras fúnebres a los m
2 CONT <p>uertos, se reconocieron y pusieron de acuerdo para que Orestes pudiera vengar a su padre.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Orestes, después de vengarse (en algunas versiones con ayuda de Electra), se volvió loco, y fue perseguido por las Erinias, cuya misión era castigar cualquier trasgresión de los lazos de piedad
2 CONC  familiar. Electra no fue acosada por las Erinias.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Orestes se refugió en el tempo en Delfos. Aunque Apolo (al cual estaba dedicado el templo délfico), le hubiera ordenado vengarse, fue incapaz de protegerlo de las consecuencias de sus acciones.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Al fin, Atenea (también conocida como areia) lo recibió en la Acrópolis de Atenas y arregló un juicio ante doce jueces áticos. Las Erinias reclamaron su víctima él presentó como atenuantela
2 CONC s órdenes de Apolo los votos de los jueces estaban equit
2 CONT <p>ativamente divididos, pero Atenea dio su voto de calidad a favor de la absolución.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Más tarde Electra se casó con Pílades, amigo íntimo de Orestes e hijo del rey Estrofo, el mismo que había cuidado a Orestes mientras se escondía de su madre y de Egisto, su amante.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Existe una tragedia llamada Electra de Sófocles y otra llamada también Electra de Eurípides cuyos argumentos están basados en este mito.

2 CONT <p>This article is about the Greek mythological personalities. For other meanings see Electra/Elektra (disambiguation).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Electra at the Tomb of AgamemnonIn Greek mythology, several persons were named Electra (also spelled Elektra):
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Daughter of Oceanus and Tethys, mother of Dardanus, Iasion and Harmonia, by Zeus.
2 CONT <p>A Pleiade or Oceanid, mother of Iris and the Harpies by Thaumas.</p>
2 CONT <p>(Most famous "Electra") Daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. Alternative: Laodice
2 CONT <p>According to the story, Electra (daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra) was absent from Mycenae when her father, King Agamemnon, returned from the Trojan War and was murdered by Aegisthus, Clytemn
2 CONC estra's lover, and/or by Clytemnestra herself. Aegisthus and Clytemnestra also killed Cassandra, Agamemnon's war prize, a prophet priestess of Troy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Eight years later Electra returned from Athens with her brother, Orestes. (Odyssey, iii. 306; X. 542). According to Pindar (Pythia, xi. 25), Orestes was saved by his old nurse or by Electra, and wa
2 CONC s taken to Phanote on Mount Parnassus, where King Strophius took charge of him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In his twentieth year, Orestes was ordered by the Delphic oracle to return home and avenge his father's death. According to Aeschylus, he met Electra before the tomb of Agamemnon, where both had go
2 CONC ne to perform rites to the dead; a recognition took place, and they arranged how Orestes should accomplish his revenge.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Orestes, after the deed (sometimes with Electra helping), goes mad, and is pursued by the Erinyes, or Furies, whose duty it is to punish any violation of the ties of family piety. Electra is not ho
2 CONC unded by the Erinyes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Orestes takes refuge in the temple at Delphi. Even though Apollo (to whom the Delphic temple was dedicated) had ordered him to do the deed, he is powerless to protect Orestes from the consequences 
2 CONC of his actions.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At last Athena (also known as Areia) receives him on the Acropolis of Athens and arranges a formal trial of the case before twelve Attic judges. The Erinyes demand their victim; he pleads the order
2 CONC s of Apollo; the votes of the judges are equally divided, and Athena gives her casting vote for acquittal. In Iphigenia at Taurus, Euripides tells the tale somewhat differently. He claims that Orestes
2 CONC  is led by the Furies to Taurus in ancient Egypt, where his sister Iphigenia is being held. The two meet as Orestes is led to Iphigenia to be prepared for sacrifice to the Egyptian Gods. Iphigenia hel
2 CONC ps her brother escape from Taurus, and the furies, sated by the reuniting of the family, abate their persecution.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Later, Electra married Pylades, Orestes' close friend and son of King Strophius (the same one who had cared for Orestes while he hid from his mother and her lover).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The psychological disorder Electra complex is named after her.</p>

2 CONT <p>John C. John C. & Deborah Darnell (universités de Yale et Chicago) ont découvert, à l’ouest de Louxor des inscriptions qu’ils jugent intermédiaires entre les hiéroglyphes et les premiers a

2 CONT <p>Leur origine remonterait au début du Moyen Empire (-1900 av. JC) alors que les débuts de l’alphabétisme ne remontaient, pensait-on, pas au delà du Nouvel Empire. Sus orígenes se remontan a l

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Les inscriptions seraient apparentées à l’ancien égyptien et à l’akkadien (dont on sait qu’il s’agissait d’une langue sémitique très ancienne parlée en Assyrie (cours moyen du Tigr

2 CONT <p>EIDOMENE, or Idomene, was a daughter of Pheres, son of Cretheus and Tyro, and Periclymene. Her brothers were Admetus and Lycurgus, and her sister was Periapis. Pheres founded the town of Pherae in 
2 CONC Thessaly. In one place Eidomene was referred to as the daughter of Abas. She married Amythaon, her uncle, thus becoming not only a cousin but also aunt of Jason, since Amythaon was brother to Aeson, J
2 CONC ason's father. By Amythaon she became the mother of sons Bias and Melampus, and a daughter Aeolia. She was sometimes called Aglaia or Dorippe. Amythaon migrated to Messenia and settled at the court of
2 CONC  Neleus, his half-brother. He started the Olympic games after the sons of Pelops left Elis. He went back to Thessaly to greet Jason when his nephew appeared at the court of Pelias. Bias and Melampus w
2 CONC ent on to become joint rulers in Argos because they were able to cure the insanity of the daughters of Proetus. Melampus was able to accomplish the cure through his combined gift of prophecy and medic
2 CONC al knowledge. Eidomene probably lived with her sons in Argos after Amythaon died and they had acquired their part of the kingdom. [Apollodorus 1.9.11, 2.2.2, 3.10.4, 13.8; Diodorus Siculus 4.68; Homer

2 CONT <p>In Greek mythology, Theia, goddess or divine, (sometimes written Thea or Thia), also called Euryphaessa, wide-shining, was a Titaness. The name Theia alone means simply, "goddess"; Theia Euryphaess

2 CONT <p>In 1.d of The Greek Myths by Robert Graves, he relates that in the Pelasgian creation myth, she was the child of Eurynome—the creator called the goddess of all things—who created Theia as a Tit

2 CONT <p>Laomedon  </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the Trojan line, Ilus who was the founder and king of Troy, married Eurydice, and became the father of Laomedon. As it was said before, his daughter Themiste married his nephew, Capys (of the Da

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The new king married Strymo, Placia or Leucippe. Whichever woman he married, he was the father of Podarces (Priam) and many other sons. He had at least one daughter, Hesione. His son Tithonus was a

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laomedon was known as the king, for his arrogance and impiety and who refused to honors his promises. Poseidon and Apollo, possibly punished for rebelling against Zeus, had to work for one year for
2 CONC  a mortal. The two gods disguised as builders, was hired to work alongside with a mortal, Aeacus, son of Zeus and Aegina, (father of Peleus and Telamon), to build the walls of Troy. Poseidon and Apoll
2 CONC o wanted the vine of gold as payment for their work. Laomedon agreed. After the gods finished building the wall, Laomedon refused to pay their wages for their services. Apollo caused the plague within
2 CONC  the city, while Poseidon send a sea-monster to ravage the Trojan countryside.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The seers told Laomedon, that land would be spare, if the king sacrifice his daughter to the sea-monster. Chaining his daughter, Hesione and waited for monster to arrive. Heracles, who was performi

2 CONT <p>Heracles raised an army in Tiryns, and the Argonaut hero, Telamon of Salamis, son of Aeacus. After capturing the city, Laomedon was killed, along with many of his sons, and Heracles gave Heisone to
2 CONC  Telamon as concubine. She allowed Hesione to ransomed one captive. Hesione ransomed her youngest brother Podarces, with her veil. Podarces became king of Troy, and changed his name to Priam (Ransom).

2 CONT <p>In Greek mythology, Laomedon was a Trojan king, son of Ilus, brother of Ganymedes and father of Priam, Astyoche, Lampus, Hicetaon, Clytius, Cilla, Proclia, Aethilla, Clytodora, and Hesione. Tithonu
2 CONC s is also described by most sources as Laomedon's eldest legitimate son; and most sources omit Ganymedes from the list of Laomedon's children, but indicate him as his uncle instead. Laomedon's two wiv
2 CONC es are Strymo (or Rhoeo) and Leucippe; by the former he begot Tithonus and by the latter King Priam (see John Tzetzes' Scholia in Lycophronem 18 («ὁ μὲν γὰρ Πρίαμος ἦν Λευκί
2 CONC πης, ὁ δὲ Τιθωνὸς Ῥοιοῦς ἢ Στρυμοῦς τῆς Σκαμάνδρου θυγατρὸς υἱός»)). He also had a son named Bucolion by the nymph Abarbarea, as recoun
2 CONC ted by Homer in the Iliad (6.22).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laomedon owned several horses with divine parentage, with whom Anchises secretly bred his own mares.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to one story, Laomedon's son, Ganymedes, was kidnapped by Zeus, who had fallen in love with the beautiful boy. Laomedon grieved for his son. Sympathetic, Zeus sent Hermes with two horses 
2 CONC so swift they could run over water. Hermes also assured Laomedon that Ganymedes was immortal and would be the cupbearer for the gods, a position of much distinction. However, Ganymedes is more usually
2 CONC  described as a son of Tros, an earlier King of Troy and grandfather of Laomedon. Laomedon himself was son of Ilus, son of Tros.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidon and Apollo, having offended Zeus, were sent to serve King Laomedon. He had them build huge walls around the city and promised to reward them well, a promise he then refused to fulfill. In 
2 CONC vengeance, before the Trojan War, Poseidon sent a sea monster to attack Troy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laomedon planned on sacrificing his daughter Hesione to Poseidon in the hope of appeasing him. Heracles (along with Oicles and Telamon) rescued her at the last minute and killed the monster. Laomed
2 CONC on had promised them the magic horses as a reward for their deeds, but when he broke his word, Heracles and his allies took vengeance by putting Troy to siege, killing Laomedon and all his sons save P
2 CONC odarces, who saved his own life by giving Heracles a golden veil Hesione had made (and therefore was afterwards called Priam, from priamai 'to buy'). Telamon took Hesione as a war prize and married he
2 CONC r; they had a son, Teucer.

2 CONT <p>When Laomedon 1 was king of Troy, Apollo and Poseidon decided to put him to the test. Assuming the likeness of mortal men, the two gods undertook to fortify Troy for wages. But when the work was do
2 CONC ne, King Laomedon 1 would not pay their wages. So Apollo sent a pestilence, and Poseidon sent a sea-monster that snatched away the people of the plain. The oracles foretold deliverance from these cala
2 CONC mities if Laomedon 1 would expose his daughter Hesione 2 to be devoured by the sea-monster. So he, more obedient of this oracle than of his agreement with the gods, exposed Hesione 2 to the monster by
2 CONC  fastening her to the rocks near the sea. When Heracles 1 saw her exposed, he promised to save her on condition of receiving from Laomedon 1 the mares which Zeus had given in compensation for the rape
2 CONC  of Ganymedes . Once again Laomedon 1 promised to pay for the service, and Heracles 1 killed the monster and saved Hesione 2 . But when this was accomplished, Laomedon 1 would not give the agreed rewa
2 CONC rd.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>For this reason, Heracles 1 made war on Troy one generation before the well known Trojan War . This attack on Troy, Heracles 1 did it in conjunction with, among others, Telamon, father of Ajax 1 .H
2 CONC eracles 1 deployed eighteen ships with fifty oars each, that is, an insignificant fleet compared to the one that sailed against Troy one generation after [see ACHAEAN LEADERS for details about this fl
2 CONC eet]. After some fight, the town was besieged, and shortly after Telamon, who was the first to breach in the wall, entered the city. After him came Heracles 1 , who killed Laomedon 1 and his sons exce
2 CONC pt for young Priam 1, who was then appointed king of Troy. The king's daughter Hesione 2 was given to Telamon as a prize. Hesione 2 is mother of Teucer 1, who became leader of the Salaminians against

2 CONT <p>Laomedon () was the son of Ilus, the founder of Troy, and of Eurydice. Laomedon became king of Ilium (Troy), after his father's death.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The new king married Strymo, Placia or Leucippe. Whichever woman he married, he was the father of Podarces (Priam) and many other sons. He had at least one daughter, Hesione. His son Tithonus was a
2 CONC bducted by Eos, goddess of dawn, and taken to Ethiopia or Syria. The goddess bore him a son Memnon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laomedon was known as the king, for his arrogance and his impiety, and who refused to honors his promises.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Poseidon and Apollo, possibly punished for rebelling against Zeus, had to work for one year for a mortal. The two gods disguised as builders, and they were hired to work alongside with a mortal, Ae
2 CONC acus, son of Zeus and Aegina, (father of Peleus and Telamon), to build the walls of Troy. Poseidon and Apollo wanted the vine of gold as payment for their work. Laomedon agreed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The walls built by Poseidon and Apollo were impregnable, while those built by Aeacus were not. The Scaean Gates were the main entrance to Troy; it was here that Paris (with Apollo's help) had morta
2 CONC lly wounded Achilles.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the gods finished building the wall, Laomedon refused to pay their wages for their services. Apollo caused the plague within the city, while Poseidon sends a sea-monster to ravage the Trojan 
2 CONC countryside.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The seers told Laomedon, that land would be spare, if the king would sacrifice his daughter to the sea-monster. Chaining his daughter, Hesione, to a rock and waited for monster to arrive.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Returning from performing the ninth labour (fetching the girdle of Hippolyte), Heracles stopped at Troy. Learning what was about to happen, Heracles wanted Laomedon's immortal horses in exchange fo
2 CONC r rescuing his daughter. Laomedon agreed. After killing the monster, again Laomedon refused to pay. Heracles angry at the Trojan king betrayal on his promise, planned to return with an army, after he 
2 CONC finished performing the twelve labours.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Heracles raised an army in Tiryns, and the Argonaut hero, Telamon of Salamis, son of Aeacus, joined the hero. After capturing the city, Laomedon was killed, along with many of his sons, and Heracle
2 CONC s gave Heisone to Telamon as concubine.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Heracles allowed Hesione to ransomed one captive. Hesione ransomed her youngest brother Podarces, offering her veil as ransom. Podarces became king of Troy, and changed his name to Priam, which mea
2 CONC ns "Ransom". Priam was also Troy's last king.

2 CONT <p>Fortellingen om trojanerne begynte først i myter og legender. Gresk mytologi sier at trojanerne var de opprinnelige borgerne i byen Troja i Troas-regionen i Anatolia (nå Tyrkia). Troja ligger i A

2 CONC  grunnla byen Ilium som han oppkalte etter seg selv. Zevs gav Ilos Palladium. Poseidon og Apollon bygget murene og befestningene rundt Troja for Laomedon, sønn av Ilos den yngre. Da Laomedon nektet

2 CONT <p>En generasjon før Trojanerkrigen erobret Herakles Troja og drepte Laomedon og hans sønner, med unntak av den unge Priam. Priam ble senere konge. Under hans styre invaderte de mykenske grekerne og

2 CONT <p>Poseidon and Apollo, having offended Zeus, were sent to serve King Laomedon. He had them build huge walls around the city and promised to reward them well, a promise he then refused to fulfill. In

2 CONT <p>In Greek mythology, Laomedon was a Trojan king, son of Ilus, brother of Ganymedes and father of Priam, Astyoche, Lampus, Hicetaon, Clytius, Cilla, Aethylla, and Hesione. Tithonus is also described 
2 CONC by most sources as Laomedon's eldest legitimate son; and most sources omit Ganymedes from the list of Laomedon's children, but indicate him as his uncle instead. Laomedon's two wives are Strymo (or Rh

2 CONT <p>According to one story, Laomedon's son, Ganymedes, was kidnapped by Zeus, who had fallen in love with the beautiful boy. Laomedon grieved for his son. Sympathetic, Zeus sent Hermes with two horses

2 CONT <p>Poseidon and Apollo, having offended Zeus, were sent to serve King Laomedon. He had them build huge walls around the city and promised to reward them well, a promise he then refused to fulfill. In

2 CONC by his lack of luck in not having a son, Acrisius consulted the oracle at Delphi, who warned him that he would one day be killed by his daughter's son. Danaë was childless and to keep her so, he impr
2 CONC isoned her in a subterranean bronze chamber in the courtyard of his palace:[3] This mytheme is also connected to Ares, Oenopion, Eurystheus, etc. Zeus came to her in the form of a shower of gold, and 
2 CONC impregnated her. Soon after was born their child Perseus— "Perseus Eurymedon,[4] for his mother gave him this name as well" (Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica IV).

2 CONT <p>Fearful for his future but unwilling to provoke the wrath of the gods by killing Zeus's offspring and his own daughter, Acrisius cast the two into the sea in a wooden chest.[5] Danaë's fearful pra

2 CONT <p>Zeus was born on Crete</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Greek mythology, Zeus was born on Crete. Two caves high in the Cretan mountains contest the honour of being known as the birthplace of the greatest god of ancient Greece: the Dikteon C
2 CONC ave in south-central Crete and the Ideon Cave on the highest mountain in Crete, Mount Ida or Psiloritis. There is no information describing exactly where Zeus was born, and each cave has its own adher
2 CONC ents. The important thing, however, is that Crete is the birthplace of Zeus, in a way which has many points of similarity to the birth of Christ, many centuries later, in another cave in what is now t
2 CONC he state of Israel. Uranus, Gaia and Cronus

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>But let’s start at the beginning... According to Hesiod’s Theogony, the first gods at the beginning of the world were Uranus (the Sky) and Gaia (the Earth). Uranus, fearful of losing his power 
2 CONC to his descendants, cast his children into the depths of the earth. Gaia, who was not  keen on her husband’s behaviour, hid her son Cronus in the marriage bed and later helped him to overthrow his f
2 CONC ather. According to myth, on Gaia’s advice Cronus took a sickle and castrated Uranus, throwing his genitals into the sea. Thus was born the beautiful goddess of love Aphrodite. Cronus and Rhea, the

2 CONT <p>But Cronus was to share his father’s fate. Afraid of his father’s prophetic curse, he swallowed his children sothey would not be able to take his place. rhea and cronus  Rhea gives to Cronus a 
2 CONC fake baby
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cronus and Rhea had had five children before Zeus, who all ended up in their father’s stomach. When Rhea became pregnant with Zeus, she did not want him to share their fate, so she asked for the 
2 CONC help of her parents, Uranus and Gaia. Following their advice, she went to Crete and hid in a cave inthe Cretan mountains to bring forth the child in secret, unknown to her child-eating husband. As she
2 CONC  gave birth, Rhea tried to stifle her cries by sinking her fingers into the earth. From each finger arose one of the ten Dactyls, benevolent inhabitants of the Cretan mountains. Throughout the birth, 
2 CONC the entrance to the cave was guarded by the legendary Curetes, whom many myths identify with the Dactyls. As soon as Rhea gave birth to Zeus, the healthy boy who was to become the Father of the Gods o
2 CONC f Olympus, she gave him to the Curetes to look after. They danced and stamped, beat their drums and clashed their shields to cover the baby’s crying. In order to deceive her husband Cronus, Rhea gav
2 CONC e him a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes instead of the baby. He swallowed the supposed infant at once and relaxed once more in the certainty that his throne was not at risk from his children.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the meantime, little Zeus was growing up in the cave where he remained hidden in the mountains of Crete. The goat Amalthea and the nymph Melissa played an important part in his upbringing. Amalt
2 CONC hea, a goat or, according to others, a nymph, suckled the holy infant and from her horn, the cornucopia or horn of plenty, came all manner of good things. The nymph Melissa nursed Zeus and looked afte
2 CONC r him, while feeding him her nourishing honey so he would grow more quickly. The War of the Titans - Zeus overthrows Cronus

2 CONT <p>When Zeus eventually grew up and came of age, he overthrew Cronus and assumed his divine authority, either bloodlessly or after a terrible war, the Titanomachy, referred to in a different version o
2 CONC f the myth. According to the version of the Titanomachy or War of the Titans, when Zeus went to find his father and take over from him, he sliced open Cronus’s belly and out leapt all the children h
2 CONC e had swallowed in the past: Hera, Poseidon, Hestia, Demeter and Pluto (Hades). With their help, Zeus fought the Titans who controlled the universe, led by Cronus. The war was long and cruel but it wa
2 CONC s finally won by Zeus and his siblings, who, together with Zeus’s children, made up the Twelve Gods of Olympus.

2 CONT <p>We all know the story of how Christ was born in a manger, with animals whose breath and bodies offered some warmth in the frozen cave, according to Orthodox tradition. But how many of us know that 
2 CONC this story is not original, but had also taken place many centuries earlier in ancient Greece, specifically on the island of Crete? According to Greek mythology, Dias or Zeus, the father of the gods o
2 CONC f Olympus, was born in a cave on Crete. No myth gives the precise location of the cave; Hesiod’s Theogony, for instance, refers to a cave near the ancient city of Lyktos in south-central Crete. This
2 CONC  led to confusion and so today there are two contenders for the title of Zeus’s birthplace: the Ideon Cave on Mount Ida or Psiloritis near the village of Anoyia, and the Dikteon Cave on Mount Dicte,
2 CONC  near the village of Psychro on the Lassithi Plateau. In both caves, excavations have brought archaeological finds to light showing that these were important cult places, but there is not enough evide
2 CONC nce to choose one of the two as the birthplace of Zeus. Similarities between the stories of Christ and Zeus

2 CONC  in Spring, following the eternal cycle of nature. Christ was crucified, died and was resurrected. From the cave of Zeus to the manger of Christ
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>birth of ChristAccording to the experts, religions evolve down the ages, adapting to new conditions. However, they always cover basic human needs, needs which do not change significantly through hi
2 CONC story. Just as our ancestors, thousands of years ago, prayed to Zeus (the Hymn to the Dictaean Zeus) for their families, their crops, their flocks and their ships, for peace and prosperity in their so
2 CONC cieties, so too do we pray to God today for exactly the same things. The only difference is that most of us are no longer farmers or shepherds, but businesspeople, employees and scientists. In Crete w
2 CONC e also have a further example of ancient practices being carried over to the new religion. When the shepherds of Mount Psiloritis accuse each other of stealing sheep, they go to the monastery of Diosk
2 CONC ourios and, before the holy icons, swear a solemn oath - not to Christ, as one would expect, but to Za (derived from the name of Zeus). Especially concerning the births of Christ and Zeus, we see coll
2 CONC ective memories and universal truths which still apply, unchanged, despite the millennia separating the two stories. Christ, according to Orthodox tradition, was born in a cave, like Zeus long before.
2 CONC  Why a cave? Perhaps because caves were the first refuges for humans, offering shelter from bad weather and wild animals. Perhaps because caves are ancient symbols of the womb, the wombs of the Earth,
2 CONC  Gaia, the Great Mother. Animals were at the side of the newborn Zeus and Christ and helped them to survive at the beginning of their lives, just as animals have helped people survive for thousands of
2 CONC  years, with their meat, milk, wool or companionship. The exercise of power by cruel rulers has led to thousands of victims in every age. Both Cronus and Herod are expressions of the bottomless human 
2 CONC thirst for power, a thirst which overcomes all law and conscience: Cronus swallowed his children alive, while Herod slaughtered all the male infants in his district. Both Zeus and Christ, in their fir
2 CONC st moments of life, faced these ruthless tyrants and were hidden in caves to survive. Just to make things clear: this article does not aim to equate Zeus with Christ. There are certainly similarities 
2 CONC in their stories, but there are even more differences, particularly in their lives and personalities. This article was not written by an expert on religions, nor is it a scientific text. These are jus
2 CONC t some simple observations whose intention is more to entertain than to teach. I hope we have managed to do so.

2 CONT <p> Zeus' grave</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Much has been written about Zeus’ grave. According to the Cretans the father of gods and people who was born in Crete was burried in the same place as well. But where is his grave? Some people lo
2 CONC ok for it in Giouchta, some others on the mountains of Lasithi and others on Mount Ida (Psiloritis). Kallinikos (or Callinicus), yet for others Epimenides of Knossos is said to have accused the Cretan
2 CONC s as being liars because they showed visitors around Zeus’ grave while he considered him immortal since he never died. As I heard by elderly people who lived between the end of 1800 until 1950-60, s
2 CONC everal Greeks but in particular foreign visitors of the village asked where was ZOU, POULOU and MAKARIA. Let us begin with ZOU. In the south-eastern side of the hill named Kefalas, opposite Nikiforian
2 CONC a or Metochi, and 100 metres west of  Amalthea’s Water, there is a cave whose roof has fallen over probably by some earthquake*.  The legend says that an old king is buried in that cave and that it 
2 CONC is full of gold. (According to Diodoros Siculos, Zeus was the first King of Crete.) This cave is called ZOU’s cave (another name for Zeus). Consequently the inhabitants of Zouliana, Zoulakkiana or Z
2 CONC oniana are entitled to claim that Zeus’ grave is situated in their territory until a further investigation on the matter is carried out and also to sing the following couplets:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Zoniana is the favourite place of Zeus</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>That is why he is still buried in its guts.</p>

2 CONT <p>* Statistics by N. Stavrakis, p. 107, “Earthquakes in Crete”: July 21, 365 BC. According to Von Hoff, ten towns were destroyed in Crete. “But if it  is true”,  says Dapper (p. 399), “that
2 CONC  in Crete there was Zeus’ grave, it becomes clear that it must have been destroyed by an earthquake which took place during the first consulship of Flavius Iulius Valens and Valentinian I in the yea
2 CONC r 360 BC during which year more than one hundred towns of this island collapsed. Lacroix adds that in 368 BC, during the time of Gratian the Great (Flavius Gratianus Augustus), a part of the island wa

2 CONT <p>Makaria</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>500 metres away from the last house in Agouriana there is a location called Makaria. The legend says that there was an ancient city, Makaria, and this is not only manifested by the legend but also 
2 CONC by the presence of more than ten, half-destroyed wine-presses with their pots, built with a special kind of lime, that is mud made by grated tile and lime. There is also a stone of 1.5 m. X 0.5 m. hav
2 CONC ing an engraved circle and at its edges two parallel holes of 0.1 m. X 0.2 m. which was probably used as a press (see picture below). In many places there are extant walls (see picture below), others 
2 CONC made by clay and others not, built with rough stones, which means that they are very old. In the “History of Crete” by V. Psilakis, Vol. 1, p. 56, footnote 1, it is cited that: Hogarth says that 
2 CONC the private dwellings of that time (before 2000 BC ) were modestly built with rough stones and clay and were painted on the inside with plaster”. There are also graves on that spot but I am not su
2 CONC re of which era, probably not very old ones.

2 CONT <p>Diogenis' foot</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Before we reach Makaria from the old road, at the location of Gagles there is a footprint on a stone which is called ‘Diogenis foot’ or Digenis’ foot’. When I asked Fragostelis (Stylianos P
2 CONC arassiris) why it is called Digenis’ foot and he explained to me, as we will see later, I noticed that he called him Diogeni rather than Digeni and I smiled ironically because, being a high school s
2 CONC tudent at the time, I thought he pronounced it wrong. Fifty years later, while reading some book I found out that the Idaean Dactyls (or Dactyli) and the Curetes were called “D – i – o –geneis
2 CONC ”, which means that they had been created by Dias (Zeus) and the descent of Dias or something like that. It was then when I remembered my uncle Fragostelis and I thought that he should be laughing i
2 CONC ronically at me. Because as we know, Digenis was the Acritan, that is the frontiersman who pursued the Apelats from the borders of the Byzantine Empire. Here in Crete Talos, the Idaean Dactyls and the
2 CONC  Curetes, who were called Diogeneis had taken on the role of Digenis centuries before him. The legend says that Diogenis or Digenis stepped on that stone, threw away his stick and cut one of the highe
2 CONC st peaks of Koukoulonas. That is why it is called Koutsotroulis (which means without a peak).

2 CONT <p>The Island</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>An ancient town is referred to with that name. Next to Garazo there is a location with that name, which is uninhabited today, but which is said to have had six Greek Families in 1894, according to 
2 CONC the ‘Topography of Crete’ by Kalomenopoulos. In addition, Ms. Argini Frangouli has written on the same matter where she expresses the opinion –having reservations though- that maybe on that loca
2 CONC tion there had been one of the most ancient towns, Lasos, Panonia or Dion. Also in Chania there was a village with that name. Moreover, at a distance of 5-6 chilometres far away from Zoniana towards P
2 CONC siloritis there is a location called the “Island”. This name is justified in every sense since from the east and north there was once lake Roussa, today a desiccated one, from the west the river O
2 CONC axis and from the south a small tributary.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In that tributary at the location of Macha high in the middle of the steep rock there is a part of a wall which makes it difficult to explain how or why it was built. In the same area a stone cutti
2 CONC ng tool resembling an axe has been found. The place on the Island has several small pieces from earthen pots. Today it is a seat inside a mitato1 of “Bouchourides” (a common Cretan family name). T

2 CONT <p>The Idaean Dactyls - Poulou</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to mythology the Idaean Dactyls or Dactyli used to be giants who were born on Mount Ida. That is why they are called Idaean, whose mission was to protect Zeus when he was little. There ar
2 CONC e many versions as to how and where they were born, which can be found in the “Cretan Mythology” by N. Psilakis. However, I will cite two of them which are related to our village. One of them says
2 CONC  that when Rhea was in labour to Zeus, she stack her fingers into the Earth so as not to scream and let Cronus hear her. From each of her fingers, which left their fingerprints, sprang a giant, in tot
2 CONC al ten of them, who were named Idaean because they were born on Mount Ida and also Dactyls (or Dactyli), the Greek equivalent of fingers, which derives from Rhea’s fingers. It was them who committed
2 CONC  themselves with the protection of Zeus.  The other version says that a nymph called Anchiale touched with her fingers Land Oaxia and from it sprang ten men who were called Idaean Dactyls. But what is
2 CONC  Land Oaxia?  As it is widely spread, the river Milopotamos crosses Zoniana, from which river the province took its name. The river was named Oaxis in antiquity (also Virgil mentions it, see Encyclope
2 CONC dia “HELIOS”). It starts from Psiloritis, crosses Zoniana, Diskouri, next to Garazo, Mourtzana, Perama and flows into the mouth between Panormos and Skaleta. It is nowadays called Geropotamos. Anc
2 CONC hiale touched the Land of Oaxis and this took place near Mount Ida in Zoniana. But even if we suppose that when we say Land Oaxia we mean the Earth of the ancient Oaxos (Axos), nothing really changes 
2 CONC because in antiquity the entire province of Zoniana and Anogeia belonged to the kingdom of Oaxos (or Axos). Therefore, Oaxia was also the Land of Zoniana. But now another question rises: Where did Rhe
2 CONC a stack her fingers and which are her fingerprints? One hand is surely situated at the location of Poulou. It is the place where the river Oaxis ends (Mesokourouno) and five streamlets begin to mount 
2 CONC up Psiloritis. If one happens to see them from a high place, one is given the impression that they look like an open, gigantic hand (a common Greek gesture which shows contempt or abuse) and this in t
2 CONC he Cretan dialect is called poulos, from which word derived the name of the location Poulou. These streamlets –fingerprints- belong to the Island, to Kavdelio, Zouridospilia, Pelekato and Lagoperama
2 CONC . To sum up, the Dactyls are called Idaean because the place is located on Mount Ida, Dactyls and Poulou because the streamlets look like open fingers, the river is called Oaxis – Land Oaxia consequ
2 CONC ently: this is the place where the ancient Cretans thought that Rhea had stack her hand.

2 CONC his own son. So to avoid this he used to swallow his children at birth. This enraged Rhea, who being pregnant with Zeus, went to Crete and gave him birth in a cave of Dicte. Nymphs fed the child Zeus 
2 CONC on the milk of Amalthea and the Curetes in arms guarded the child in the cave, clashing their spears on their shields in order to prevent Cronos to hear his voice. In the meantime Rhea wrapped a stone

2 CONT <p>Zeus</p>
2 CONT <p>Gudarnas och himmelsens gud, avbildad med en åskvigg eller blixt i sin hand. Zeus var den mäktigaste guden, och hade tagit makten från sin far Kronos. Zeus var en vädergud, liksom lagens, state
2 CONC ns, samhällets, stadens, familjens och främlingarnas gud.
2 CONT <p>Zeus huvudhelgedom låg i Dodona, där man trodde att man kunde höra framtiden viskas av vinden som blåste genom löven i gudens heliga ekar som växte där. I Olympia hedrades han vart fjärde 
2 CONC r med de olympiska spelen, och Feidias staty av honom där ansågs vara en av den antika världens sju underverk.  De nemeiska spelen hölls också till hans ära. Fåglarna, särskilt örnen, ansåg
2 CONC s vara hans budbärare och därför försökte hans präster förutsäga framtiden genom att betrakta deras flykt. Berg uppkallades ofta efter Zeus, och än idag finns det Zeusberg över hela Grekland
2 CONC , till exempel på Kreta och Naxos.  På Kreta dyrkades Zeus särskilt eftersom det ansågs att han växt upp där, gömd från sin far som skulle ha ätit upp honom om han hade vetat att han existera
2 CONC de. På Kreta ansåg man att han fötts där, och också att det var där han dog. Det fanns tillochmed en grav där som sades vara hans.
2 CONT <p>Namnet Zeus anses komma ifrån det sanskritiska "dyaus" vilket betyder himmel. De antika grekerna kallade honom också Dias, och detta namn har genom latinets deus kommit att bli ett vanligt ord f
2 CONC r gud i många språk.  Vid sidan av att vara den högsta guden var Zeus också en stygg gud. Han var ständigt otrogen mot sin svartsjuka hustru och syster Hera, och han hade många barn både med d
2 CONC ödliga och odödliga kvinnor. Med Hera hade han Ares, Hebe, Hefaistos och Eileithyia.
2 CONT <p>I en svans skepnad hade han förfört drottning Leda av Sparta, och hon födde honon den sköna Helena och Polydeukes. I ens tjurs skepnad borförde han den feniciska prinsessan Europa, och hon fö
2 CONC dde honom Minos och Rhadamanhus.  Med minnes gudinna Mnemosyne blev han de nio musernas far, och med andra gudinnor och dödliga kvinnor hade han Apollon, Artemis, Dionysos och Herakles.  Zeus var ock
2 CONC så den ende föräldern till Athena, vars märkvärdiga födsel skedde efter att han haft en fruktansvärd huvudvärk. Hefaistos drämde en slägga i hans huvud, och ur sprang gudinnan fullvuxen och 
2 CONC i rustning.  Inte bara kvinnor var hans offer. Den unge rojanske prins Ganymedes borfördes av Zeus och togs till Olympen där han blev gudarnas tjänare.
2 CONT <p>I Rom dyrkades Zeus under namnet Jupiter.</p>

2 CONT <p>Prehistory</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus is the continuation of Dyeus, the supreme god in Indo-European religion, also continued as Vedic Dyaus Pitar (cf. Jupiter), and as Tyr (Ziu, Tiw, Tiwaz) in Germanic and Norse mythology. Tyr wa
2 CONC s however supplanted by Odin as the supreme god among the Germanic tribes and they did not identify Zeus/Jupiter with either Tyr or Odin, but with Thor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In addition to his Indo-European inheritance, the classical Zeus also derives certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the ancient Near East, such as the scepter.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Role and epithets</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus played a huge role in the Greek Olympic pantheon. He fathered many of the heroes and heroines (see list at bottom of article) and was featured in many of their stories. Though he was the god o
2 CONC f the sky and thunder, he was also the most supreme cultural artifact; in some senses, he was the embodiment of Greek religious beliefs and the archetypal Greek deity.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The epithets or titles applied to Zeus emphasized different aspects of his wide-ranging authority:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Olympios emphasized Zeus's kingship over both the gods and the Panhellenic festival at Olympia.
2 CONT <p>A related title was Panhellenios, ('Zeus of all the Hellenes') to whom Aeacus' famous temple on Aegina was dedicated.
2 CONT <p>As Xenios, Zeus was the patron of hospitality and guests, ready to avenge any wrong done to a stranger.
2 CONT <p>As Horkios, he was the keeper of oaths. Liars who were exposed were made to dedicate a statue to Zeus, often at the sanctuary of Olympia.
2 CONT <p>As Agoraios, Zeus watched over business at the agora, and punished dishonest traders.
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Panhellenic cults of Zeus</p>
2 CONT <p>The major center at which all Greeks converged to pay honor to their chief god was Olympia. The quadrennial festival there featured the famous Games. There was also an altar to Zeus made not of sto
2 CONC ne, but of ash - from the accumulated remains of many centuries' worth of animal victims immolated there.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Outside of the major inter-polis sanctuaries, there were certain modes of worshipping Zeus that were shared across the Greek world. Most of the above titles, for instance, could be found at any num
2 CONC ber of Greek temples from Asia Minor to Sicily. Certain modes of ritual were held in common as well: sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar, for instance.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the other hand, certain cities had Zeus-cults that operated in markedly different ways.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Some local Zeus-cults</p>
2 CONT <p>In addition to the Panhellenic titles and conceptions listed above, local cults maintained their own idiosyncratic ideas about the king of gods and men. A few examples are listed below.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Cretan Zeus</p>
2 CONT <p>On Crete, Zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at Knossos, Ida and Palaikastro. The stories of Minos and Epimenides suggest that these caves were once used for incubatory divination by kings an
2 CONC d priests. The dramatic setting of Plato's Laws is along the pilgrimage-route to one such site, emphasizing Cretan knowledge. On Crete, Zeus was represented in art as a long-haired youth rather than a
2 CONC  mature adult, and hymned as ho megas kouros "the great youth". With the Kouretes, a band of ecstatic armed dancers, he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the Cr
2 CONC etan paideia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Hellenistic writer Euhemerus apparently proposed a theory that Zeus had actually been a great king of Crete and that posthumously his glory had slowly turned him into a deity. The works of Euhe
2 CONC merism have not survived, but Christian patristic writers took up the suggestion with enthusiasm.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus Lykaios in Arcadia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laconian kylix of the 6th century BC, showing Zeus Lykaios with an eagle.The title Lykaios is morphologically connected to lyke "brightness", and yet it looks a lot like lykos "wolf". This semantic
2 CONC  ambiguity is reflected in the strange cult of Zeus Lykaios in the backwoods of Arcadia, where the god takes on both lucent and lupine features. On the one hand, he presides over Mt Lykaion ("the brig
2 CONC ht mountain") the tallest peak in Arcadia, and home to a precinct in which, allegedly, no shadows were ever cast (Pausanias 8.38). On the other hand, he is connected with Lycaon ("the wolf-man") whose
2 CONC  ancient cannibalism was commemorated with bizarre, recurring rites. According to Plato (Republic 565d-e), a particular clan would gather on the mountain to make a sacrifice every eight years to Zeus 
2 CONC Lykaios, and a single morsel of human entrails would be intermingled with the animal's. Whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf, and could only regain human form if he did not eat aga
2 CONC in of human flesh until the next eight-year cycle had ended.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Subterranean Zeus</p>
2 CONT <p>Although etymology indicates that Zeus was originally a sky god, many Greek cities honored Zeuses who lived underground. Athenians and Sicilians honored Zeus Meilichios ("kindly" or "honeyed") whil
2 CONC e other cities had Zeus Chthonios ("earthy"), Katachthonios ("under-the-earth) and Plousios ("wealth-bringing"). These deities might be represented indifferently as snakes or men in visual art. They a
2 CONC lso received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits, as did chthonic deities like Persephone and Demeter, and also the heroes at their tombs. Olympian gods, by contrast, usually
2 CONC  received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In some cases, cities were not entirely sure whether the daimon to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground Zeus. Thus the shrine at Lebadaea in Boeotia might belong to the hero Trophonius
2 CONC  or to Zeus Trephonius ("the nurturing"), depending on whether you believe Pausanias or Strabo. The hero Amphiaraus was honored as Zeus Amphiaraus at Oropus outside of Thebes, and the Spartans even ha
2 CONC d a shrine to Zeus Agamemnon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Oracles of Zeus</p>
2 CONT <p>Although most oracle sites were usually dedicated to Apollo, the heroes, or various or goddesses like Themis, a few oracular sites were dedicated to Zeus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>The Oracle at Dodona</p>
2 CONT <p>The cult of Zeus at Dodona in Epirus, where there is evidence of religious activity from the 2nd millennium BC onward, centered around a sacred oak. When the Odyssey was composed (circa 750 BC), di
2 CONC vination was done there by barefoot priests called Selloi, who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches (Od. 14.326-7). By the time Herodotus wrote about Dodona, female p
2 CONC riestesses called peleiades ("doves") had replaced the male priests.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus' wife at Dodona was not Hera, but the goddess Dione — whose name is a feminine form of "Zeus". Her status as a titaness suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre-Hellenic d
2 CONC eity, and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle..
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>The Oracle at Siwa</p>
2 CONT <p>The oracle of Ammon at the oasis of Siwa in Egypt did not lie within the bounds of the Greek world before Alexander's day, but it already loomed large in the Greek mind during the archaic era: Hero
2 CONC dotus mentions consultations with Zeus Ammon in his account of the Persian War. Zeus Ammon was especially favored at Sparta, where a temple to him existed by the time of the Peloponnesian War (Pausani
2 CONC as 3.18).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Other oracles of Zeus</p>
2 CONT <p>The chthonic Zeuses (or heroes) Trophonius and Amphiaraus were both said to give oracles at the cult-sites.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus and foreign gods</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus was equivalent to the Roman god Jupiter (from Jovis Pater or "Father Jove") and associated in the syncretic classical imagination with various other deities, such as the Egyptian Ammon and the
2 CONC  Etruscan Tinia. He (along with Dionysus) absorbed the role of the chief Phrygian god Sabazios in the syncretic deity known in Rome as Sabazius.

2 CONT <p>Zeus, son of Cronus and Rhea; ruler of the sky and wielder of lightning.[edit]
2 CONT <p>Birth</p>
2 CONT <p>Cronus sired several children by Rhea: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, but swallowed them all as soon as they were born, since he had learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be
2 CONC  overcome by his own son as he had overthrown his own father. But when Zeus was about to be born, Rhea sought Uranus and Gaia to devise a plan to save him, so that Cronus would get his retribution for
2 CONC  his acts against Uranus and his own children. Rhea gave birth to Zeus in Crete, handing Cronus a rock wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he promptly swallowed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Childhood</p>
2 CONT <p>Rhea hid Zeus in a cave on Mount Ida in Crete. According to varying versions of the story:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He was then raised by Gaia.</p>
2 CONT <p>He was raised by a goat named Amalthea, while a company of Kouretes, soldiers, or smaller gods danced, shouted and clapped their hands to make noise so that Cronus would not hear the baby's cry. (S
2 CONC ee cornucopia.)
2 CONT <p>He was raised by a nymph named Adamanthea. Since Cronus ruled over the Earth, the heavens and the sea, she hid him by dangling him on a rope from a tree so he was suspended between earth, sea and s
2 CONC ky and thus, invisible to his father.
2 CONT <p>He was raised by a nymph named Cynosura. In gratitude, Zeus placed her among the stars after her death.
2 CONT <p>He was raised by Melissa, who nursed him with goat-milk</p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus becomes king of the gods</p>
2 CONT <p>After reaching manhood, Zeus forced Cronus to disgorge the other children in reverse order of swallowing: first the stone, which was set down at Pytho under the glens of Parnassus to be a sign to m
2 CONC ortal men, then the rest. In some versions, Metis gave Cronus an emetic to force him to disgorge the babies, or Zeus cut Cronus' stomach open. Then Zeus released the brothers of Cronus, the Gigantes, 
2 CONC the Hecatonchires and the Cyclopes, from their dungeon in Tartarus (The Titans; he killed their guard, Campe. As gratitude, the Cyclopes gave him thunder and the thunderbolt, or lightning, which had p
2 CONC reviously been hidden by Gaia.) Together, Zeus and his brothers and sisters, along with the Gigantes, Hecatonchires and Cyclopes overthrew Cronus and the other Titans. The Titans were then cast into a
2 CONC  shadowy underworld region known as Tartarus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the battle with the Titans, Zeus shared the world with his elder brothers, Poseidon and Hades, by drawing lots: Zeus got the sky and air, Poseidon the waters, and Hades the world of the dead 
2 CONC (the underworld). Land was left to all three, each according to their capabilities, which explains why Poseidon was the "earth-shaker" (the god of earthquakes) and Hades claimed the humans that died. 
2 CONC (See also: Penthus)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gaia was upset at the way Zeus had treated the Titans, because they were her children. Soon after taking the throne as king of the gods, Zeus had to fight some of Gaia's other children, the monster
2 CONC s Typhon and Echidna. He vanquished Typhon and trapped him under a mountain, but left Echidna and her children alive as challenges for future heroes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus and Hera</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus was brother and consort of Hera. The issue of their union was Ares, though Hera produced other offspring of her own: Hephaistos, Eileithyia, Hebe. The conquests of Zeus among nymphs and the my
2 CONC thic mortal progenitors of Hellenic dynasties are famous. Olympian mythography even credits him with unions with Demeter, Latona, Dione and Maia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Among the mortals: Semele, Io, Europa and Leda. For more details, see below).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mythic anecdote renders Hera as jealous of his amorous conquests and a consistent enemy of Zeus' mistresses and their children by him. For a time, a nymph named Echo had the job of distracting Hera
2 CONC  from his affairs by incessantly talking: when Hera discovered the deception, she cursed Echo to repeat the words of others.

2 CONT <p>Zeus miscellany</p>
2 CONT <p>Though Zeus could be petty and malicious, he also had a righteous streak, perhaps best exemplified in his aid on behalf of Atreus and his murder of Capaneus for unbridled arrogance. He was also the
2 CONC  protector of strangers and travelers against those who might seek to victimize them.
2 CONT <p>Zeus turned Pandareus to stone for stealing a bronze dog from one of his temples on Crete.
2 CONT <p>Zeus killed Salmoneus with a thunderbolt for attempting to equal him, riding around on a bronze chariot and loudly imitating thunder.
2 CONT <p>As a child, Zeus had had a friend named Celmis. Many years later, Rhea became offended by the antics of Celmis and asked Zeus to turn him into a lump of steel or diamond. Zeus obliged.
2 CONT <p>Zeus turned Periphas into an eagle after his death, as a reward for being righteous and just.
2 CONT <p>At the marriage of Zeus and Hera, a nymph named Chelone was disrespectful (or refused to attend). Zeus condemned her to eternal silence.
2 CONT <p>When Memnon died, Zeus felt pity for his mother, Eos, the dawn-goddess, and granted him immortality.
2 CONT <p>Zeus made the decision to marry Aphrodite off to Hephaestus in order to prevent violence over her between the many gods who lusted after the goddess of beauty.
2 CONT <p>Zeus, with Hera, turned King Haemus and Queen Rhodope into mountains (Balkan and Despoto, respectively) for their vanity.
2 CONT <p>Zeus exchanged a caduceus for the first flute with Hermes.</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus turned Atalanta and Hippomenes (or Melanion) into lions because they had sex in one of his temples.
2 CONT <p>Zeus blinded Tiresias but also gave him the gift of prophecy (though according to some versions of the story, it was actually Hera who did the blinding).
2 CONT <p>Today the phrase "by Jove" is still sometimes used in the United Kingdom. The comedian Ken Dodd uses the phrase "By Jove, missus".
2 CONT <p>Zeus punished Hera by dangling her by her toes from the sky.</p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Zeus in Neopaganism</p>
2 CONT <p>Far from the role Zeus held in Ancient Mythology, modern Neopagans typically view Zeus as a governing figurehead and little more. Most neopagans reject ancient myths about Zeus. Zeus has relatively
2 CONC  few worshippers in modern neopaganism, and (unlike his roles in Mythology) is seen as a god of governance and authority. Though many see Zeus as the King or Figurehead as ruler over the Olympians, th
2 CONC ey often consider him of lesser importance than the Gaia and other popular Titan gods who are not believed to be bound to Tartarus. The power and influence of Zeus is thought to pale in importance to 
2 CONC Hades and other gods more directly related to the afterlife. It is thought by many Neopagans, for example, that Hades holds far greater power than Zeus, and that his decisions and authority, particula
2 CONC rly over the fate of mortals, often overshadows Zeus. Those sects that do include worship of Zeus often do so in passing, including him with other gods simply because of his relation in mythology. The
2 CONC re is little relevance between actual mythology and modern perceptions of Zeus by most Neopagans. It could be argued that, by and large, modern Neopagan perceptions of Zeus are New Age and not founded
2 CONC  in any actual history or mythology. Worship of Zeus sometimes includes the burning of oils, or more often a passing utterance of him as an authority of Olympus or husband of Hera (a more popular deit
2 CONC y in modern neopaganism).

2 CONC , are colonists from SAIS IN EGYPT." (Quoted from Diodorus of Sicily. G. H. Oldfather, 1933. Vol I, bks I-II, 1-34, p.91). An examination of some of the historical clues reveals that there lived in Eg
2 CONC ypt -- during the time of the bondage of the Israelites -- a man named DARDA. According to E. Raymond Capt, "Darda, "the Egyptian," (son of Zarah) was "DARDANUS," the EGYPTIAN FOUNDER OF TROY." (Jacob

2 CONT <p>This article is about the terms Dardan and Dardanian in classical writings. For the Shannara character, see Dardan (Shannara).

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The terms Dardan and Dardanian in classical writings were synonymous with the term Trojan, the Dardans being Trojans, an ancient people of the Troad in northwestern Anatolia. The Dardans derived th
2 CONC eir name from Dardanus, the mythical founder of Dardania (Asia minor), an ancient city in the Troad. Rule of the Troad was divided between Dardania and Troy. Homer makes a clear distinction between th
2 CONC e Trojans and the Dardanians.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Royal House of Troy was also divided into two branches, that of Dardania, and that of Troy (or Ilium). The House of Dardania was older than the House of Troy, but Troy later became more powerfu
2 CONC l than Dardania. Aeneas is referred to in Virgil's Aeneid interchangeably as a Dardan or as a Trojan, but strictly speaking Aeneas was of the Dardanian branch. Many rulers of Rome claimed descent from
2 CONC  Aeneas and the Houses of Troy and Dardania.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The strait of the Dardanelles was named after the Dardans, who lived in the region.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The ethnic affinities of the Dardans (and Trojans) and the nature of their language remain a mystery. The remains of their material culture reveal close ties with Thracians, other Anatolian groups,
2 CONC  and Greek contact.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Archaeological finds from the Troad dating back to the Chalcolithic period show striking affinity to archaeological finds known from the same era in Muntenia and Moldavia, and there are other trace
2 CONC s which suggest close ties between the Troad and the Carpatho-Balkan region of Europe. Archaeologists in fact have stated that the styles of certain ceramic objects and bone figurines show that these 
2 CONC objects were brought into the Troad by Carpatho-Danubian colonists; for example, certain ceramic objects have been shown to have Cucuteni origins [2].They are totally unrelated to the later Thraco-Ill
2 CONC yrian tribe of the same name [3].

2 CONT <p>In Greek mythology, Dardanus (Greek: Δάρδανος, English translation: "burned up", from the verb δαρδάπτω (dardapto) to wear, to slay, to burn up)[1] was a son of Zeus and Electra, da
2 CONC ughter of Atlas, and founder of the city of Dardania on Mount Ida in the Troad.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1.61–62) states that Dardanus' original home was in Arcadia where Dardanus and his elder brother Iasus (elsewhere more commonly called Iasion) reigned as kings followi
2 CONC ng Atlas. Dardanus married Chryse daughter of Pallas by whom he fathered two sons: Idaeus and Dymas. When a great flood occurred, the survivors, who were living on mountains that had now become island
2 CONC s, split into two groups: one group remained and took Deimas as king while the other sailed away, eventually settling in the island of Samothrace. There Iasus (Iasion) was slain by Zeus for lying with
2 CONC  Demeter. Dardanus and his people found the land poor and so most of them set sail for Asia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However another account by Virgil in his Aeneid (3.163f), has Aeneas in a dream learn from his ancestral Penates that "Dardanus and Father Iasius" and the Penates themselves originally came from He
2 CONC speria which was afterward renamed as Italy. This tradition holds that Dardanus was a Tyrrhenian prince, and that his mother Electra was married to Corythus, king of Tarquinia (Aeneid 7.195-242; 8. 59
2 CONC 6 ss. ; 9. 10; Servio, ad Vergilium, Aeneidos, 9.10).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Other accounts make no mention of Arcadia or Hesperia, though they sometimes mention a flood and speak of Dardanus sailing on a hide-raft (as part of the flood story?) from Samothrace to the Troad 
2 CONC near Abydos. All accounts agree that Dardanus came to the Troad from Samothrace and was there welcomed by King Teucer and that Dardanus married Batea the daughter of Teucer. (Dionysius mentions that D
2 CONC ardanus' first wife Chryse had died.) Dardanus received land on Mount Ida from his father-in-law. There Dardanus founded the city of Dardania.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dardanus' children by Batea were Ilus, Erichthonius and Idaea. According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1.50.3), Dardanus also had a son named Zacynthus by Bataea and this Zacynthus was the first s
2 CONC ettler on the island afterwards called Zacynthus. Dionysius also says (1.61.4) that Dardanus's son Idaeus gave his name to the Idaean mountains, that is Mount Ida, where Idaeus built a temple to the M
2 CONC other of the Gods (that is to Cybele) and instituted mysteries and ceremonies still observed in Phrygia in Dionysius's time. There are operas on the subject of Dardanus by Jean-Philippe Rameau (1739),
2 CONC  Carl Stamitz (1770) and Antonio Sacchini (1784).

2 CONT <p>Biblical basis for Darda</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Persistent secular legends from Greece and Rome identify Dara as Dardanus, founder of ancient Troy.[1] At least one translation of the Antiquities of Flavius Josephus, in mentioning King Solomon as
2 CONC  being wiser than two men named Calcol and Dara (Darda), gives Dara's name as "Dardanos." So perhaps Dara and Dardanus were regarded as the same man during the first century AD.[2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As a further complication, the Greek poet Homer says that Dardanus was a son (or descendant) of Zeus, the chief of the Greek gods.[3], The Roman and Greek legends say that Zeus (called Jupiter in L
2 CONC atin) was a son of Saturn who was also called Kronus. Writing of the Greek gods, Sanchuniathon, a Phoenician historian, says that "Kronus, whom the Phoenicians called Israel, had a son Jehud."[4]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the above, some would cite Homer and Sanchuniathon as testifying that Dardanus (who founded the Trojan kingdom) was a descendant of Jehud (Judah) whose father was Israel.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However, this deduction ignores the repeated custom that each Greek city followed as the cult of Zeus spread to it: they would identify their own municipal god-founder as Zeus and thus subsume thei
2 CONC r municipal cult into the cult of Zeus. Therefore no identification of Zeus with Judah could possibly be conclusive. In any event the Bible gives no direct evidence that the Zarhites, or any branches 
2 CONC of that clan, abandoned the forty-year march of the Israelites and traveled to the Aegean Sea or the Black Sea (called the Euxine or Friendly Sea in those days) to found their own kingdoms.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>That at least some Hebrew manuscripts, including the Westminster Leningrad Codex, lack 1_Kings 4:20-34 , including the key verse that spells the name of Dara as "Darda", might or might not be signi

2 CONT <p>Dardanus</p>
2 CONT <p>Son till nymfen Elektra med Zeus, och make till kung Teukers dotter. När kungen dog blev Dardanus kung och han kallade sitt rike Dardania. Dess huvudstad kallades Troja efter hans sonson Tros.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I've decided to place the name of Darda as being the father of Dardanus.
2 CONT <p>The reason is quite simple and it makes a lot of sense when one looks at the philogy within the old Teutonic, Gothic and Visigothic naming system. In Portugal we see Poao in the name of the progeni
2 CONC tor or grandfather of the surname, the son takes the name Pais, Peres, which means, son of.
2 CONT <p>In the Visigoth one almost sees the same pattern as the surnames are passed from father to son, (Patronymic names.) The Gothic people also had the same system as well as the ancient Romans, the fir
2 CONC st name of a Roman son was always, Flavius. Using the same system of naming sons after their fathers makes a lot of sense when apllied to Darda and Dardanus. The son of Darda in essence would be Darda
2 CONC nus. Then it was indeed Darda who founded and built Troy.
2 CONT <p>I have chosen to dispense with the mythos in order to try to make sense of the genealogy and bring it into a real historical setting. The story that people descended from gods might be contained wi
2 CONC thin the realm of symbolism. Today we cannonize people, make them saints because of some brave action or a deed that exhibited an over and above compassion for humanity. Can it be that the gods were "
2 CONC saintly" people and ultra talented in some way that was over and above the norm of their day.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Several biblical histories classify Zarah as the father of the kings of Troy, Crete, and Milisia (early Irish).  Thus, the first kings of Troy, (Darda of Dardania, his son Ericthonius of Troy, and 
2 CONC grandson Tros of Arcadia) are listed in many genealogies as descendants of Zarah.  Odin, the father of the scandanavian kings, traces his lineage to the kings of Troy.  This, then, is one line from th
2 CONC e medieval Kings of Europe to Adam.  The biblical history is the second, and follows the descendants of Zarah's brother Pharez through the Jewish kings into moderntimes.  However, Greek and Roman myth
2 CONC ology have different opinions of the origin of the Trojan kings.  Homer discusses Darda of Dardania in his work "The Illiad", referring to him as the son of Zeus (or Jupiter, in Roman mythology), and 
2 CONC Electra.  He is described as a colonizer, having established many cities and lands, and founding the city-state of Troy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Homer's account: "In the beginning Dardanos was the son of Zeus, and founded Dardania, for Ilion (Troy) was not yet established on the plain for men to dwell in, and her people still abode on the s
2 CONC purs of many-fountained Ida.  Dardanos hada son, king Erichthonios, who was wealthiest of all men living; he had three thousand mares that fed by the water-meadows, they and their foals with them. Bor
2 CONC eas was enamored of them as they were feeding, and covered them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. Twelve filly foals did they conceive and bear him, andthese, as they sped over the fertile pl
2 CONC ain, would go bounding on over the ripe ears of wheat and not break them; or again when they would disport themselves onthe broad back of Ocean they could gallop on the crest of a breaker. Erichthonio
2 CONC s begat Tros, king of the Trojans,and Tros had three noble sons, Ilos, Assarakos, and Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the gods carried him off to be Zeus' cupbearer, for his beauty
2 CONC 's sake, that he might dwell among the immortals."

2 CONT <p>In Greek mythology, Dardanus (Greek ???da??? "burned up", from the verb da?d?pt?(dardapto) to wear, to slay, to burn) was a son of Zeus and Electra, daughter of Atlas, and founder of the city of Da
2 CONC rdania on Mount Ida in the Troad.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1.61–62) states that Dardanus' original home was in Arcadia where Dardanus and his elder brother Iasus (elsewhere more commonly called Iasion) reigned as kings followi
2 CONC ng Atlas. Dardanus married Chryse daughterof Pallas by whom he fathered two sons: Idaeus and Dymas. When a great flood occurred, the survivors, who were living on mountains that had now become islands
2 CONC ,split into two groups: one group remained and took Deimas as king while the other sailed away, eventually settling in the island of Samothrace. There Iasus (Iasion) was slain by Zeus for lying with D
2 CONC emeter. Dardanus and his people found theland poor and so most of them set sail for Asia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However another account by Virgil in his Aeneid (3.163f), has Aeneas in a dreamlearn from his ancestral Penates that "Dardanus and Father Iasius" and the Penates themselves originally came from Hes
2 CONC peria which was afterward renamed as Italy. This tradition holds that Dardanus was a Tyrrhenian prince, and that his mother Electra was married to Corythus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Other accounts make no mention of Arcadia or Hesperia, though they sometimes mention a flood and speak of Dardanus sailing on a hide-raft (as part of the floodstory?) from Samothrace to the Troad n
2 CONC ear Abydos.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>All accounts agree that Dardanus came to the Troad from Samothrace and was therewelcomed by King Teucer and that Dardanus married Batea the daughter of Teucer.(Dionysius mentions that Dardanus' fir
2 CONC st wife Chryse had died.) Dardanus received land on Mount Ida from his father-in-law. There Dardanus founded the city ofDardania.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dardanus' children by Batea were Ilus, Erichthonius and Idaea. According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1.50.3), Dardanus also had a son named Zacynthus by Bataea and this Zacynthus was the first s
2 CONC ettler on the island afterwards called Zacynthus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dionysius also says (1.61.4) that Dardanus's son Idaeus gave his name to the Idaean mountains, that is Mount Ida, where Idaeus built a temple to the Mother of the Gods (that is to Cybele) and insti

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Greek mythology, Atlas (Eng. /'æt ləs/ Gk. Ἄτλας) was the primordial Titan who supported the heavens. Atlas was the son of the Titan Iapetus and the Oceanid Asia[1] or Klyménē (Κλυ

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"Now Iapetus took to wife the neat-ankled maid Clymene, daughter of Ocean, and went up with her into one bed. And she bare him a stout-hearted son, Atlas: also she bare very glorious Menoetius and 
2 CONC clever Prometheus, full of various wiles, and scatter-brained Epimetheus."[3]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hyginus emphasises the primordial nature of Atlas by making him the son of Aether and Gaia.[4] In contexts where a Titan and a Titaness are assigned each of the seven planetary powers, Atlas is pai

2 CONT <p>Uranus (pronounced /ˈjʊərənəs, jʊˈreɪnəs/) is the Latinized form of Ouranos (Οὐρανός), the Greek word for sky. In Greek mythology Ouranos or Father Sky, is personified as the son a
2 CONC nd husband of Gaia, Mother Earth (Hesiod, Theogony). Uranus and Gaia were ancestors of most of the Greek gods, but no cult addressed directly to Uranus survived into Classical times,[1] and Uranus doe
2 CONC s not appear among the usual themes of Greek painted pottery. Elemental Earth, Sky and Styx might be joined, however, in a solemn invocation in Homeric epic.[2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Most Greeks considered Uranus to be primordial (protogenos), and gave him no parentage. Under the influence of the philosophers, Cicero, in De Natura Deorum ("The Nature of the Gods"), claims that 
2 CONC he was the offspring of the ancient gods Aether and Hemera, Air and Day. According to the Orphic Hymns, Ouranos was the son of the personification of night, Nyx. His equivalent in Roman mythology was

2 CONT <p>[edit] Creation myth</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the Olympian creation myth, as Hesiod tells it in Theogony, Uranus came every night to cover the earth and mate with Gaia, but he hated the children she bore him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hesiod names the Titans, six sons and six daughters, the one-hundred-armed giants (Hecatonchires) and the one-eyed giants, the Cyclopes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus imprisoned Gaia's youngest children in Tartarus, deep within Earth, where they caused pain to Gaia. She shaped a great flint-bladed sickle and asked her sons to castrate Uranus. Only Cronus,
2 CONC  youngest of the Titans, was willing: he ambushed his father and castrated him, casting the severed testicles into the sea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>For this fearful deed, Uranus called his sons Titanes Theoi, or "Straining Gods"[3].
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the blood which spilled from Uranus onto the Earth came forth the Gigantes, the three avenging Furies — the Erinyes — Meliae, the ash-tree nymphs, and according to some, the Telchines.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the genitals in the sea came forth Aphrodite. The learned Alexandrian poet Callimachus[4] reported that the bloodied sickle had been buried in the earth at Zancle in Sicily, but the Romanized 
2 CONC Greek traveller Pausanias was informed that the sickle had been thrown into the sea from the cape near Bolina, not far from Argyra on the coast of Achaea, whereas the historian Timaeus located the sic
2 CONC kle at Corcyra;[5] Corcyrans claimed to be descendants of the wholly legendary Phaeacia visited by Odysseus, and by ca 500 BCE one Greek mythographer, Acusilaus, was claiming that the Phaeacians had s
2 CONC prung from the very blood of Uranus' castration.[6]

2 CONT <p>Uranus, also known as Ouranos, was the embodiment of the sky or heavens, and known as the god of the sky. He was the first son of Gaia (the earth) and he also became her husband. According to Hesio
2 CONC d, their children included the Titans: six sons (Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus and Cronus) and six daughters (Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe and Tethys). There were other offspring:
2 CONC  the Cyclopes, (who were named Brontes, Steropes and Arges and were later known as "one eyed giants"), and also the three monsters known as the Hecatonchires, who each had one hundred hands and fifty 
2 CONC heads. Their names were Briareus, Cottus and Gyes. Other offspring of Uranus and Gaia were the Erinyes, who were spirits of punishment and goddesses of vengeance. The Erinyes avenged wrongs which were
2 CONC  done to family, especially murder within a family. After Uranus had been castrated, his blood fell to earth (Gaia) and conceived the Giants. These were of monstrous appearance and had great strength.
2 CONC  Similiarly, in some versions Aphrodite is believed to have risen from the foam created by the sex organs of Uranus after they were thrown into the sea by his son Cronus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus was aghast by the sight of his offspring, the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires. (In a differing version Uranus was frightened of their great strength and the fact that they could easily depos
2 CONC e him). He hid them away in Tartarus (the bowels of the earth) inside Gaia, causing her intense pain. The discomfort became so great that she asked her youngest son, Cronus, to castrate his father, as
2 CONC  this would cease his fertility and put an end to more monstrous offspring. To accomplish this deed Gaia made an adamantine sickle, which she gave to Cronus. That night Uranus came to lay with Gaia. A
2 CONC nd as the sky god drew close, Cronus struck with the sickle and cut off Uranus's genitals. From the blood that fell from the open wound were born nymphs and giants, and when Cronus threw the severed g
2 CONC enitals into the sea a white foam appeared. From this foam Aphrodite the goddess of love and desire was born.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A slightly differing version tells of Uranus being so vast that he could cover Mother Earth (Gaia) and easily take advantage of her fruitfulness, but Gaia tired of her exuberant fertility and begge
2 CONC d her sons to free her from the excessive embrace of Uranus. All refused except Cronus. Armed with a sickle he castrated Uranus, and the blood which fell from the mutilation gave birth to the Erinyes 
2 CONC (Furies), the Giants and the Meliae (Nymphs of the manna ash trees). And when Cronus threw the sickle into the sea the island of Corfu, home of the Phaeacians, sprang up).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Uranus (the sky) had been emasculated, the sky separated from Gaia (the earth) and Cronus became king of the gods. Later, Zeus (the son of Cronus) deposed his father and became the supreme go
2 CONC d of the Greek Pantheon.

2 CONT <p>[edit] Creation myth</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the Olympian creation myth, as Hesiod tells it in Theogony, Uranus came every night to cover the earth and mate with Gaia, but he hated the children she bore him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hesiod names the Titans, six sons and six daughters, the one-hundred-armed giants (Hecatonchires) and the one-eyed giants, the Cyclopes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus imprisoned Gaia's youngest children in Tartarus, deep within Earth, where they caused pain to Gaia. She shaped a great flint-bladed sickle and asked her sons to castrate Uranus. Only Cronus,
2 CONC  youngest of the Titans, was willing: he ambushed his father and castrated him, casting the severed testicles into the sea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>For this fearful deed, Uranus called his sons Titanes Theoi, or "Straining Gods"[3].
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the blood which spilled from Uranus onto the Earth came forth the Gigantes, the three avenging Furies — the Erinyes — Meliae, the ash-tree nymphs, and according to some, the Telchines.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the genitals in the sea came forth Aphrodite. The learned Alexandrian poet Callimachus[4] reported that the bloodied sickle had been buried in the earth at Zancle in Sicily, but the Romanized 
2 CONC Greek traveller Pausanias was informed that the sickle had been thrown into the sea from the cape near Bolina, not far from Argyra on the coast of Achaea, whereas the historian Timaeus located the sic
2 CONC kle at Corcyra;[5] Corcyrans claimed to be descendants of the wholly legendary Phaeacia visited by Odysseus, and by ca 500 BCE one Greek mythographer, Acusilaus, was claiming that the Phaeacians had s
2 CONC prung from the very blood of Uranus' castration.[6]

2 CONT <p>[edit] Creation myth</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the Olympian creation myth, as Hesiod tells it in Theogony, Uranus came every night to cover the earth and mate with Gaia, but he hated the children she bore him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hesiod names the Titans, six sons and six daughters, the one-hundred-armed giants (Hecatonchires) and the one-eyed giants, the Cyclopes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus imprisoned Gaia's youngest children in Tartarus, deep within Earth, where they caused pain to Gaia. She shaped a great flint-bladed sickle and asked her sons to castrate Uranus. Only Cronus,
2 CONC  youngest of the Titans, was willing: he ambushed his father and castrated him, casting the severed testicles into the sea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>For this fearful deed, Uranus called his sons Titanes Theoi, or "Straining Gods"[3].
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the blood which spilled from Uranus onto the Earth came forth the Gigantes, the three avenging Furies — the Erinyes — Meliae, the ash-tree nymphs, and according to some, the Telchines.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the genitals in the sea came forth Aphrodite. The learned Alexandrian poet Callimachus[4] reported that the bloodied sickle had been buried in the earth at Zancle in Sicily, but the Romanized 
2 CONC Greek traveller Pausanias was informed that the sickle had been thrown into the sea from the cape near Bolina, not far from Argyra on the coast of Achaea, whereas the historian Timaeus located the sic
2 CONC kle at Corcyra;[5] Corcyrans claimed to be descendants of the wholly legendary Phaeacia visited by Odysseus, and by ca 500 BCE one Greek mythographer, Acusilaus, was claiming that the Phaeacians had s
2 CONC prung from the very blood of Uranus' castration.[6]

2 CONT <p>After Uranus was deposed, Kronos re-imprisoned the Hecatonchires and Cyclopes in Tartarus. Uranus and Gaia then prophesied that Kronos in turn was destined to be overthrown by his own son, and so t
2 CONC he Titan attempted to avoid this fate by devouring his young. Zeus, through deception by his mother Rhea, avoided this fate.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>These ancient myths of distant origins were not expressed in cults among the Hellenes[7] The function of Uranus was as the vanquished god of an elder time, before real time began.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After his castration, the Sky came no more to cover the Earth at night, but held to its place, and "the original begetting came to an end" (Kerényi). Uranus was scarcely regarded as anthropomorphi
2 CONC c, aside from the genitalia in the castration myth. He was simply the sky, which was conceived by the ancients as an overarching dome or roof of bronze, held in place (or turned on an axis) by the Tit
2 CONC an Atlas. In formulaic expressions in the Homeric poems ouranos is sometimes an alternative to Olympus as the collective home of the gods; an obvious occurrence would be the moment at the end of Iliad
2 CONC  i, when Thetis rises from the sea to plead with Zeus: "and early in the morning she rose up to greet Ouranos-and-Olympus and she found the son of Kronos..."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"'Olympus' is almost always used of that home, but ouranos often refers to the natural sky above us without any suggestion that the gods, collectively live there," William Sale remarked;[8] Sale co
2 CONC ncluded that the earlier seat of the gods was the actual Mount Olympus, from which the epic tradition by the time of Homer had transported them to the sky, ouranos. By the sixth century, when a "heave
2 CONC nly Aphrodite" was to be distinguished from the "common Aphrodite of the people", ouranos signifies purely the celestial sphere itself.

2 CONT <p>Uranus, also known as Ouranos, was the embodiment of the sky or heavens, and known as the god of the sky. He was the first son of Gaia (the earth) and he also became her husband. According to Hesio

2 CONT <p>[edit] Creation myth</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the Olympian creation myth, as Hesiod tells it in Theogony, Uranus came every night to cover the earth and mate with Gaia, but he hated the children she bore him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hesiod names the Titans, six sons and six daughters, the one-hundred-armed giants (Hecatonchires) and the one-eyed giants, the Cyclopes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus imprisoned Gaia's youngest children in Tartarus, deep within Earth, where they caused pain to Gaia. She shaped a great flint-bladed sickle and asked her sons to castrate Uranus. Only Cronus,
2 CONC  youngest of the Titans, was willing: he ambushed his father and castrated him, casting the severed testicles into the sea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>For this fearful deed, Uranus called his sons Titanes Theoi, or "Straining Gods"[3].
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the blood which spilled from Uranus onto the Earth came forth the Gigantes, the three avenging Furies — the Erinyes — Meliae, the ash-tree nymphs, and according to some, the Telchines.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the genitals in the sea came forth Aphrodite. The learned Alexandrian poet Callimachus[4] reported that the bloodied sickle had been buried in the earth at Zancle in Sicily, but the Romanized 
2 CONC Greek traveller Pausanias was informed that the sickle had been thrown into the sea from the cape near Bolina, not far from Argyra on the coast of Achaea, whereas the historian Timaeus located the sic
2 CONC kle at Corcyra;[5] Corcyrans claimed to be descendants of the wholly legendary Phaeacia visited by Odysseus, and by ca 500 BCE one Greek mythographer, Acusilaus, was claiming that the Phaeacians had s
2 CONC prung from the very blood of Uranus' castration.[6]

2 CONC c, aside from the genitalia in the castration myth. He was simply the sky, which was conceived by the ancients as an overarching dome or roof of bronze, held in place (or turned on an axis) by the Tit
2 CONC an Atlas. In formulaic expressions in the Homeric poems ouranos is sometimes an alternative to Olympus as the collective home of the gods; an obvious occurrence would be the moment at the end of Iliad
2 CONC  i, when Thetis rises from the sea to plead with Zeus: "and early in the morning she rose up to greet Ouranos-and-Olympus and she found the son of Kronos..."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"'Olympus' is almost always used of that home, but ouranos often refers to the natural sky above us without any suggestion that the gods, collectively live there," William Sale remarked;[8] Sale co
2 CONC ncluded that the earlier seat of the gods was the actual Mount Olympus, from which the epic tradition by the time of Homer had transported them to the sky, ouranos. By the sixth century, when a "heave
2 CONC nly Aphrodite" was to be distinguished from the "common Aphrodite of the people", ouranos signifies purely the celestial sphere itself.

2 CONT <p>by Ron Leadbetter</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus, also known as Ouranos, was the embodiment of the sky or heavens, and known as the god of the sky. He was the first son of Gaia (the earth) and he also became her husband. According to Hesio
2 CONC d, their children included the Titans: six sons (Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus and Cronus) and six daughters (Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe and Tethys). There were other offspring:
2 CONC  the Cyclopes, (who were named Brontes, Steropes and Arges and were later known as "one eyed giants"), and also the three monsters known as the Hecatonchires, who each had one hundred hands and fifty 
2 CONC heads. Their names were Briareus, Cottus and Gyes. Other offspring of Uranus and Gaia were the Erinyes, who were spirits of punishment and goddesses of vengeance. The Erinyes avenged wrongs which were
2 CONC  done to family, especially murder within a family. After Uranus had been castrated, his blood fell to earth (Gaia) and conceived the Giants. These were of monstrous appearance and had great strength.
2 CONC  Similiarly, in some versions Aphrodite is believed to have risen from the foam created by the sex organs of Uranus after they were thrown into the sea by his son Cronus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus was aghast by the sight of his offspring, the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires. (In a differing version Uranus was frightened of their great strength and the fact that they could easily depos
2 CONC e him). He hid them away in Tartarus (the bowels of the earth) inside Gaia, causing her intense pain. The discomfort became so great that she asked her youngest son, Cronus, to castrate his father, as
2 CONC  this would cease his fertility and put an end to more monstrous offspring. To accomplish this deed Gaia made an adamantine sickle, which she gave to Cronus. That night Uranus came to lay with Gaia. A
2 CONC nd as the sky god drew close, Cronus struck with the sickle and cut off Uranus's genitals. From the blood that fell from the open wound were born nymphs and giants, and when Cronus threw the severed g
2 CONC enitals into the sea a white foam appeared. From this foam Aphrodite the goddess of love and desire was born.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A slightly differing version tells of Uranus being so vast that he could cover Mother Earth (Gaia) and easily take advantage of her fruitfulness, but Gaia tired of her exuberant fertility and begge
2 CONC d her sons to free her from the excessive embrace of Uranus. All refused except Cronus. Armed with a sickle he castrated Uranus, and the blood which fell from the mutilation gave birth to the Erinyes 
2 CONC (Furies), the Giants and the Meliae (Nymphs of the manna ash trees). And when Cronus threw the sickle into the sea the island of Corfu, home of the Phaeacians, sprang up).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Uranus (the sky) had been emasculated, the sky separated from Gaia (the earth) and Cronus became king of the gods. Later, Zeus (the son of Cronus) deposed his father and became the supreme go
2 CONC d of the Greek Pantheon.

2 CONT <p>[edit] Creation myth</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the Olympian creation myth, as Hesiod tells it in Theogony, Uranus came every night to cover the earth and mate with Gaia, but he hated the children she bore him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hesiod names the Titans, six sons and six daughters, the one-hundred-armed giants (Hecatonchires) and the one-eyed giants, the Cyclopes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus imprisoned Gaia's youngest children in Tartarus, deep within Earth, where they caused pain to Gaia. She shaped a great flint-bladed sickle and asked her sons to castrate Uranus. Only Cronus,
2 CONC  youngest of the Titans, was willing: he ambushed his father and castrated him, casting the severed testicles into the sea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>For this fearful deed, Uranus called his sons Titanes Theoi, or "Straining Gods"[3].
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the blood which spilled from Uranus onto the Earth came forth the Gigantes, the three avenging Furies — the Erinyes — Meliae, the ash-tree nymphs, and according to some, the Telchines.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From the genitals in the sea came forth Aphrodite. The learned Alexandrian poet Callimachus[4] reported that the bloodied sickle had been buried in the earth at Zancle in Sicily, but the Romanized 
2 CONC Greek traveller Pausanias was informed that the sickle had been thrown into the sea from the cape near Bolina, not far from Argyra on the coast of Achaea, whereas the historian Timaeus located the sic
2 CONC kle at Corcyra;[5] Corcyrans claimed to be descendants of the wholly legendary Phaeacia visited by Odysseus, and by ca 500 BCE one Greek mythographer, Acusilaus, was claiming that the Phaeacians had s
2 CONC prung from the very blood of Uranus' castration.[6]

2 CONT <p>After Uranus was deposed, Kronos re-imprisoned the Hecatonchires and Cyclopes in Tartarus. Uranus and Gaia then prophesied that Kronos in turn was destined to be overthrown by his own son, and so t
2 CONC he Titan attempted to avoid this fate by devouring his young. Zeus, through deception by his mother Rhea, avoided this fate.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>These ancient myths of distant origins were not expressed in cults among the Hellenes[7] The function of Uranus was as the vanquished god of an elder time, before real time began.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After his castration, the Sky came no more to cover the Earth at night, but held to its place, and "the original begetting came to an end" (Kerényi). Uranus was scarcely regarded as anthropomorphi
2 CONC c, aside from the genitalia in the castration myth. He was simply the sky, which was conceived by the ancients as an overarching dome or roof of bronze, held in place (or turned on an axis) by the Tit
2 CONC an Atlas. In formulaic expressions in the Homeric poems ouranos is sometimes an alternative to Olympus as the collective home of the gods; an obvious occurrence would be the moment at the end of Iliad
2 CONC  i, when Thetis rises from the sea to plead with Zeus: "and early in the morning she rose up to greet Ouranos-and-Olympus and she found the son of Kronos..."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"'Olympus' is almost always used of that home, but ouranos often refers to the natural sky above us without any suggestion that the gods, collectively live there," William Sale remarked;[8] Sale co
2 CONC ncluded that the earlier seat of the gods was the actual Mount Olympus, from which the epic tradition by the time of Homer had transported them to the sky, ouranos. By the sixth century, when a "heave
2 CONC nly Aphrodite" was to be distinguished from the "common Aphrodite of the people", ouranos signifies purely the celestial sphere itself.

2 CONT <p>Uranus, also known as Ouranos, was the embodiment of the sky or heavens, and known as the god of the sky. He was the first son of Gaia (the earth) and he also became her husband. According to Hesio
2 CONC d, their children included the Titans: six sons (Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus and Cronus) and six daughters (Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe and Tethys). There were other offspring:
2 CONC  the Cyclopes, (who were named Brontes, Steropes and Arges and were later known as "one eyed giants"), and also the three monsters known as the Hecatonchires, who each had one hundred hands and fifty 
2 CONC heads. Their names were Briareus, Cottus and Gyes. Other offspring of Uranus and Gaia were the Erinyes, who were spirits of punishment and goddesses of vengeance. The Erinyes avenged wrongs which were
2 CONC  done to family, especially murder within a family. After Uranus had been castrated, his blood fell to earth (Gaia) and conceived the Giants. These were of monstrous appearance and had great strength.
2 CONC  Similiarly, in some versions Aphrodite is believed to have risen from the foam created by the sex organs of Uranus after they were thrown into the sea by his son Cronus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uranus was aghast by the sight of his offspring, the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires. (In a differing version Uranus was frightened of their great strength and the fact that they could easily depos
2 CONC e him). He hid them away in Tartarus (the bowels of the earth) inside Gaia, causing her intense pain. The discomfort became so great that she asked her youngest son, Cronus, to castrate his father, as
2 CONC  this would cease his fertility and put an end to more monstrous offspring. To accomplish this deed Gaia made an adamantine sickle, which she gave to Cronus. That night Uranus came to lay with Gaia. A
2 CONC nd as the sky god drew close, Cronus struck with the sickle and cut off Uranus's genitals. From the blood that fell from the open wound were born nymphs and giants, and when Cronus threw the severed g
2 CONC enitals into the sea a white foam appeared. From this foam Aphrodite the goddess of love and desire was born.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A slightly differing version tells of Uranus being so vast that he could cover Mother Earth (Gaia) and easily take advantage of her fruitfulness, but Gaia tired of her exuberant fertility and begge
2 CONC d her sons to free her from the excessive embrace of Uranus. All refused except Cronus. Armed with a sickle he castrated Uranus, and the blood which fell from the mutilation gave birth to the Erinyes 
2 CONC (Furies), the Giants and the Meliae (Nymphs of the manna ash trees). And when Cronus threw the sickle into the sea the island of Corfu, home of the Phaeacians, sprang up).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Uranus (the sky) had been emasculated, the sky separated from Gaia (the earth) and Cronus became king of the gods. Later, Zeus (the son of Cronus) deposed his father and became the supreme go
2 CONC d of the Greek Pantheon.

2 CONT <p> Background</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gaia, more frequently spelled Ge, was the Earth. She is rarely even referred to as a deity, she is more a power. What is. She was one of the firsts. Well, one of the firsts in some versions. There 
2 CONC are actually a couple of different Creation myths, and not all of them include Gaia (I know, it shocked me, too). The original Greek Mythology (ie, pre-Classical) was was Pelasgian myth (the Pelasgian
2 CONC s came to Greece from the Asia Minor 3,000 years before Hesiod). The Pelasgian creation story focuses on Eurynome, the Goddess of All Things. But you can go to the Myth Page on Eurynome's Creation Sto
2 CONC ry if you want to learn more about that. Here, we will focus on Gaia. There are two parts: .
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"First in my prayer, before all other deities,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I call upon Gaia, Primeval Prophetess . . .</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Greek great earth mother."</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>~Aeschylus~</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Creation of Her</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There are two accepted versions of Classical creation: Hesiod's and Ovid's. Both versions begin with Gaia's emergence from Chaos. She has a parthenogenic birth (ie, only one parent needed). Accordi
2 CONC ng to Ovid, Gaia pretty much just appeared (similar to the Judeo-Christian creation story). After her birth, Ovid continued to see the hand of a Creator at work (an un-named Creator), who populated Ga
2 CONC ia with the necessary mountains, seas, flora, and fauna. I much prefer Hesiod's version.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Before I tell you about what Hesiod had to say, I'm going to give you this wonderful quote from his creation story:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gaia, the beautiful, rose up,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Broad blossomed, she that is the steadfast base</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Of all things. And fair Gaia first bore</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The starry Heaven, equal to herself,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>To cover her on all sides and to be</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A home forever for the blessed Gods.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>And now back to the story. According to Hesiod, the first beings sprang into existance without cause or explanation. After Gaia came Tartarus (the lowest level of the Underworld, also viewed as a s
2 CONC ort of huge cave or pit) and then came Eros: Erotic Love. Chaos continues her parthenogenic streak, giving birth to Erebus and Nyx. In her sleep, Gaia gives parthenogenic birth to Uranus (the Universe
2 CONC , who emerges as big and powerful as Gaia) and Pontus (the Sea, and the God of the Sea). Uranus, bursting (literally) with love for Gaia (possible only by the creation of Eros, you see), showers her w
2 CONC ith fertile rain and this is how Gaia gives birth to the rest of creation (you remember, seas, mountains, etc. - we already covered this with Ovid). Gaia and Uranus also gave birth to the Titans, the 
2 CONC three Cyclopes and the three Hundred-Armed Giants.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Creation by Her</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There aren't tons of stories about Gaia. She's important, yes, and she shows up a lot, but not so much as an active participant in the story so much as a default womb and mother. She has LOTS of ki
2 CONC ds. And what really makes her special is that she can have these kids without active participation by a father. In many ways the Universe was created by her alone (okay, not really - but she did give 
2 CONC birth to her son Uranus who then became her partner in the whole populating space thing). Once, Zeus had a wet dream at night that got Gaia pregnant, too (the child of that union was Agdistis).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There's a bunch of other mentions of her giving birth to people (especially men) - one of the most important was Erichthonius, who founded Athens.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gaia's Children Include:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•Uranus (yes I know he was her "husband" - but he was also her son - very Oedipal isn't it?...)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•50-Headed, 100-Armed Giants: Cottus, Briareus, and Gyges</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•The Cyclopes: Brontes, Steropes, and Arges (Cyclope means Wheel-Eyed</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•The Titans: Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Cronus, Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, and Tethys
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•The Erinyes: Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megara</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•Giants: born full-grown with armor and spears, ouchies for Gaia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•Meliads: otherwise known as the Ash Tree Nymphs</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>•Aetna, Eurybia, Nereus, Phorcys, Ceto, Thaumas, Atlas, Acheron, Antaeus, Agdistis, Erichthonius, Hyllus, Dreams, Python, the list goes on.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Don't know who your mama is? That's okay, Gaia's the default, and you can always accurately claim her. A good mythical example of this is when Pyrrha and Deucalion had to throw their mothers' bones
2 CONC  over their shoulders!
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Yay Ge!</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The King Must Die</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Forgive me for ripping off Mary Renault's title, but if there's any goddess the idea really relates to, I think it would be Gaia. The theory is that every year the king was ritually sacrificed (kil
2 CONC led by a rival, sacrificed in public, or only metaphorically murdered) to renew the land and the fertility of the kingdom. I'm not really gonna get any further into that because it's not actually from
2 CONC  any Greek myth in particular, but it does seem like at least a decent introduction to the myth in which Gaia took her most active role.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>So, Gaia and Uranus had a whole bunch of babies, as described above. Uranus, like many men, did his part in creating the children, but wasn't ready to be a daddy and tried to stuff the new life bac
2 CONC k into Gaia's womb. Then he tried to keep the kids inside her by blocking the entrance. With his own genitals. Can you imagine? Well, Gaia turned around (inside?) and gave her youngest son, Cronos (th
2 CONC e Titan) a scythe to cut off his papa's penis and free the children. As a consequence, Cronos also took over as the Big God In Charge - a role previously held by Uranus, despite the appearance that it
2 CONC  was Gaia with the real power.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Unfortunately, despite getting how he was put into power, Cronos only repeated the cycle. He put the Giants and the Cyclopes into Tartarus (deep pit type of jail) and whenever his wife, Rhea, gave 
2 CONC birth, he swallowed the baby. He was threatened, it appears by this whole biological process that was beyond his control. After five pregnancies and five births and five babies devoured, Rhea went to 
2 CONC Gaia and the two conspired to keep her youngest son - Zeus - from being swallowed and then got Cronos to vomit up the other ingested gods. With the promise from Zeus that he would free the other child
2 CONC ren of Earth, Gaia supported him in overthrowing Cronos and the rule of the Titans.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Will it surprise you to learn that Zeus did not remain true to the women who made him and put him in power? Almost immediately he stuck Gaia's monstrous children back in Tartarus. And when his woma
2 CONC n, Metis, became pregnant, he started getting worried that like father like child. But he had learned more from his mothers than they intended. Rather than try to force his mate into submission or to 
2 CONC steal her progeny, he skipped that altogether by swallowing her! When she gave birth, it was inside his body, and the child, Athena, had to be born of HIS body. By co-opting the labor and the birth, h
2 CONC e kept Athena from any allegiance to a mother and broke the cycle of Kings dying to maintain the proper balance of Earth. The power of fertility was usurped by the patriarchy and Gaia stopped, for the
2 CONC  most part, involving herself in the lives of her children.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Oh Goddess, Source of Gods and Mortals,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>All-Fertile, All-Destroying Gaia,</p>
2 CONT <p></p>

2 CONT <p>From: Greek Mythology Summary by Wikipedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"Myths of origin" or "creation myths" represent an attempt to render the universe comprehensible in human terms and explain the origin of the world.[21] The most widely accepted account of beginnin
2 CONC g of things as reported by Hesiod's Theogony, starts with Chaos, a yawning nothingness. Out of the void emerged Ge or Gaia (the Earth) and some other primary divine beings: Eros (Love), the Abyss (the
2 CONC  Tartarus), and the Erebus.[22] Without male assistance Gaia gave birth to Uranus (the Sky) who then fertilised her. From that union were born, first, the Titans: six males and six females (Oceanus, C
2 CONC oeus and Crius and Hyperion and Iapetus, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne, Phoebe and Tethys, and Cronus); then the one-eyed Cyclopes and the Hecatonchires or Hundred-Handers. Cronus ("the wily, y
2 CONC oungest and most terrible of [Gaia's] children"[22])castrated his father and became the ruler of the gods with his sister-wife Rhea as his consort and the other Titans became his court. This motif of 
2 CONC father/son conflict was repeated when Cronus was confronted by his son, Zeus. Zeus, persuaded by his mother, challenged him to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, with the help of the Cyclopes,
2 CONC  (whom Zeus freed from Tarturus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.[23] The earliest Greek thought about poetry considere
2 CONC d the theogony to be the prototypical poetic genre — the prototypical mythos — and imputed almost magical powers to it. Orpheus, the archetypal poet, was also the archetypal singer of theogonies, 
2 CONC which he uses to calm seas and storms in Apollonius' Argonautica, and to move the stony hearts of the underworld gods in his descent to Hades. When Hermes invents the lyre in the Homeric Hymn to Herme
2 CONC s, the first thing he does is sing the birth of the gods.[24] Hesiod's Theogony is not only the fullest surviving account of the gods, but also the fullest surviving account of the archaic poet's func
2 CONC tion, with its long preliminary invocation to the Muses. Theogony was also the subject of many lost poems, including those attributed to Orpheus, Musaeus, Epimenides, Abaris and other legendary seers,
2 CONC  which were used in private ritual purifications and mystery-rites. There are indications that Plato was familiar with some version of the Orphic theogony.[25] A few fragments of these works survive i
2 CONC n quotations by Neoplatonist philosophers and recently unearthed papyrus scraps. One of these scraps, the Derveni Papyrus now proves that at least in the 5th century BC a theogonic-cosmogonic poem of 
2 CONC Orpheus was in existence. This poem attempted to outdo Hesiod's Theogony and the genealogy of the gods was extended back with Nyx (Night) as an ultimate beginning before Uranus, Cronus and Zeus.[26] T
2 CONC he first philosophical cosmologists reacted against, or sometimes built upon, popular mythical conceptions that had existed in the Greek world for some time. Some of these popular conceptions can be g
2 CONC leaned from the poetry of Homer and Hesiod. In Homer, the Earth was viewed as a flat disk afloat on the river of Oceanus and overlooked by a hemispherical sky with sun, moon and stars. The Sun (Helios
2 CONC ) traversed the heavens as a charioteer and sailed around the Earth in a golden bowl at night. Sun, earth, heaven, rivers, and winds could be addressed in prayers and called to witness oaths. Natural 
2 CONC fissures were popularly regarded as entrances to the subterranean house of Hades, home of the dead.[27]

2 CONT <p>Dans la mythologie grecque, Cronos (en grec ancien Κρόνος / Krónos), fils d'Ouranos (le Ciel) et Gaïa (la Terre), est le roi des Titans et le père de Zeus. Il est souvent confondu avec son

2 CONT <p>Fils d'Ouranos (le Ciel) et Gaïa (la Terre), Cronos appartient à la première génération des dieux ; il est le plus jeune des Titans, les douze enfants divins possédant une apparence normale1.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Homère et Hésiode2 le nomment « le dieu aux pensées fourbes3 » ou « à l'esprit retors4 » (ἀγκυλομήτης / ankulomētēs, littéralement « recourbé »), terme qui s'applique peut
2 CONC -être originellement à sa faux5. Hésiode ajoute qu'il hait son père, lequel voue les mêmes sentiments à ses enfants, sans que l'on sache si cela s'applique seulement à ses enfants difformes —
2 CONC  les Cyclopes et les Hécatonchires — ou à l'ensemble de sa progéniture6. Dès leur naissance, il les emprisonne dans le sein de leur mère. Furieuse, Gaïa fabrique une faucille en acier et deman
2 CONC de à ses enfants de l'aider à se venger, mais seul Cronos répond à l'appel7. Placé en embuscade, il attaque Ouranos alors que celui-ci vient se coucher avec Gaïa, et de sa faux, lui tranche les 
2 CONC testicules, qu'il jette à la mer. Ouranos leur donne alors le nom de « Titans » parce que, précise Hésiode, ils ont tendu le bras trop haut et parce que l'avenir saura en tirer vengeance8. Ourano
2 CONC s et Gaïa avertissent également Cronos qu'il sera détrôné à son tour par son propre fils9.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hésiode n'indique pas que Cronos assume le pouvoir à la mort de son père, même s'il mentionne par ailleurs qu'il règne parmi les Immortels10. En revanche, des sources plus tardives indiquent q

2 CONC s Travaux et les Jours, on apprend que Zeus accorde aux héros de vivre dans les îles des Bienheureux, aux confins de la Terre ; un vers interpolé ajoute qu'ils séjournent « loin des Immortels, et

2 CONT <p>Amours et postérité</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Initialement limitée aux six premiers Olympiens, la postérité de Cronos devait s'étoffer chez les auteurs récents.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ainsi, le poète crétois Épiménide, fait-il naître Aphrodite, les Moires et les Euménides de ses amours avec Evonymé, tandis qu'une tradition isolée lui attribue la paternité des Dactyles p
2 CONC ar la muse Calliope. Les Hymnes orphiques lui reconnaissent également celle du dieu phrygien Sabazios et divers scholiastes lui donnent encore pour fille la nymphe Plouto, amante de Zeus et mère de 
2 CONC Tantale. Enfin, Eustathius lui reconnaît un septième enfant par Rhéa en la personne du dieu guerrier Ényalios, plus généralement considéré comme un fils d'Arès (voire comme un simple surnom d
2 CONC e ce dernier).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Le Catalogue des femmes attribué à Hésiode fait état de son adultère avec l'Océanide Philyra. Surpris par Rhéa, Cronos se métamorphosa aussitôt en cheval, aussi Philyra, le terme venu, don
2 CONC na-t-elle naissance sur le Mont des Tilleuls au Centaure Chiron (motif notamment repris par le pseudo-Apollodore, Apollonios de Rhodes, Ovide et Hygin). De Cronos et de Philyra naquirent encore Dolops
2 CONC 21 et le roi de Libye Aphros, ancêtre des peuples carthaginois et libyens22.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>À cette liste viennent encore s'ajouter les enfants attribués à Cronos par les traditions à caractère évhémériste. Ainsi, Philon de Byblos, dans son Histoire des Ouranides, prétend qu'ayan
2 CONC t épousé Rhéa, Cronos aurait simultanément pris pour maîtresses deux de ses sœurs de cette dernière, Dioné et Aphrodite ou Astarté, puis engendré avec cette dernière Pothos, l'un des dieux 
2 CONC de l'Amour.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dans la tradition orphique</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>La tradition orphique présente un personnage assez différent de celui de la tradition hésiodique, assimilé à la divinité du temps Chronos. Dans la version la plus ancienne, Cronos fait partie
2 CONC , avec Ouranos, Zeus et sans doute Dionysos, des quatre divinités primordiales issues de Nyx, la nuit. Dans le Timée de Platon, Cronos y est le fils de d'Océan et de Téthys, eux-mêmes enfants d'O
2 CONC uranos et Gaïa23. Dans les Rhapsodies orphiques, plus récentes, Phanès ou Métis émerge le premier et règne sur le monde ; Nyx lui succède, puis Ouranos, puis Cronos. Celui-ci a la souveraineté
2 CONC  à la fois sur le ciel et la terre ; son règne correspond à l'Âge d'or.

2 CONT <p>Culte</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cronos occupe une place faible dans le culte. Des fêtes lui sont consacrées à Athènes, les Kronia, qui voient un renversement de l'ordre social. Les esclaves sont invités par leurs maîtres à
2 CONC  un banquet et peuvent faire la fête à travers toute la cité. Dans les cités ioniennes, Cronos donne son nom à un mois, le Kronion, équivalent du Scirophorion attique.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Plusieurs étymologies ont été suggérées, notamment « l'Avaleur »24, mais sans rencontrer de consensus25. Dès l'Antiquité, on rapproche son nom de l'homophone Chronos (grec Χρόνος / K

2 CONT <p>Como resultado de su asociación con la abundante y generosa edad dorada, Crono fue venerado como una deidad de la cosecha, supervisor de cultivos como el trigo,de la naturaleza, la agricultura y l

2 CONT <p>En los antiguos mitos griegos, Crono envidiaba el poder de su padre y gobernante del universo, Urano. Éste se había ganado la enemistad de Gea, madre de Crono y los demás Titanes, cuando escondi
2 CONC ó a sus hijos menores, los Cíclopes, gigantes de un
2 CONT <p> solo ojo, y los Hecatónquiros, gigantes de cien brazos y cincuenta cabezas en el Tártaro, para que no vieran la luz. Gea creó una gran hoz de pedernal y reunió a Crono y sus hermanos para conv
2 CONC encerles de que matasen a Urano. Sólo Crono estuvo di
2 CONT <p>spuesto a cumplir sus deseos, así que Gea le dio la hoz y le hizo tender una emboscada. Cuando Urano se encontró con Gea, Crono le atacó con la hoz y le castró. De la sangre (o, según algunas 
2 CONC pocas fuentes, del semen) que salpicó en la Tierra, su
2 CONT <p>rgieron los Gigantes, las Erinias y las Melias (ninfas de los fresnos). Crono arrojó al mar la hoz (que dio origen a la isla de Corfú) y el miembro amputado de Urano, que produjo una espuma de la
2 CONC  que nacería Afrodita. Por esto, Urano juró venganz
2 CONT <p>a y llamó a sus hijos titenes (‘los que abusan’) por exceder sus límites y osar cometer tal acto, lo que supone la fuente del nombre Titán.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En una versión alternativa, un Crono más benévolo derrocó a Ofión, el malvado Titán serpiente. Al hacerlo liberó al mundo de su esclavitud y por un tiempo gobernó justamente.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tras derrotar a Urano, Crono volvió a encerrar en el Tártaro a los Hecatónquiros y los Cíclopes, a quienes temía, y los dejó bajo la custodia de la monstruosa carcelera Campe. Subió al trono
2 CONC  junto a su hermana Rea como reyes de los dioses. Esta é
2 CONT <p>poca del reinado de Crono se denominó la edad dorada, pues la gente de entonces no necesitaba leyes ni reglas: todos hacían lo correcto y no existía la inmoralidad.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Crono supo de Gea y Urano, poseedores del conocimiento del porvenir, que estaba destinado a ser derrocado por uno de sus propios hijos. Por ello, aunque fue padre con Rea de los dioses Deméter, He
2 CONC ra, Hades y Hestia, se los tragaba tan pronto como
2 CONT <p> nacían para evitar que la profecía se cumpliese. Finalmente, cuando iban a nacer su quinto y sexto hijos, Poseidón y Zeus, Rea pidió a Gea que urdiese un plan para salvarlos y que así finalme
2 CONC nte Crono tuviese el justo castigo a sus actos contra
2 CONT <p> su padre y sus propios hijos. Rea dio a luz en secreto a Zeus en la isla de Creta y entregó a Crono una piedra envuelta en pañales, también conocida como Ónfalos, que éste tragó en seguida s
2 CONC in desconfiar creyendo que era su hijo. Lo mismo ocurri
2 CONT <p>ó con Poseidón, tragando Crono un potro en su lugar.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Algunas versiones (Pausanias viii.8.2) cuentan que Crono no tragó a Poseidón, sino que Rea le ocultó del mismo modo que a Zeus, dando a su hermano un caballo en lugar de una piedra para que lo t
2 CONC ragase.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Rea mantuvo oculto a Zeus en una cueva del monte Ida en Creta. Según diversas versiones de esta historia, Zeus fue criado:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    * Por una cabra llamada Amaltea, mientras una compañía de Curetes o Coribantes, bailarines armados, gritaban y daban palmadas para hacer ruido y que así Crono no oyese los llantos delniño.
2 CONT <p>    * Por una ninfa llamada Adamantea, que escondió al niño colgándolo con una cuerda de un árbol de forma que quedara suspendido entre la tierra, el mar y el cielo, sobre los que gobernaba su 
2 CONC padre, Crono.
2 CONT <p>    * Por su abuela Gea.</p>
2 CONT <p>    * Por una ninfa llamada Cinosura, a quien en agradecimiento Zeus subió entre las estrellas tras su muerte.
2 CONT <p>    * Por Melisa, quien lo alimentó con leche de cabra.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cuando hubo crecido, Zeus usó un veneno que le dio Gea para obligar a Crono a vomitar el contenido de su estómago en orden inverso: primero la piedra, que se le dejó a Pitón bajo las cañadas d
2 CONC el Parnaso como señal a los hombres mortales, y despué
2 CONT <p>s al resto de sus hermanos. En algunas versiones, Metis le dio a Crono un emético para obligarle a vomitar los niños, y en otras Zeus abrió el estómago de Crono. Tras liberar a sus hermanos, Ze
2 CONC us liberó del Tártaro a los Hecatónquiros y los Cíclo
2 CONT <p>pes, quienes forjaron para él sus rayos. En una gran guerra llamada la Titanomaquia, Zeus y sus hermanos y hermanas junto con los Gigantes, Hecatónquiros y Cíclopes, derrocaron a Crono y a los o
2 CONC tros Titanes. Tras esto, muchos de los Titanes fuero
2 CONT <p>n encerrados en el Tártaro, si bien otros no (como Atlas, Crono, Epimeteo, Metis, Menecio, Océano y Prometeo). Gea engendró a Tifón para vengar a los encarcelados Titanes, si bien Zeus terminar
2 CONC ía venciéndolo.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Una versión más antigua de Crono, anterior al culto de Zeus, se considera relacionada con la deidad semítica Ba`al Hammon. Se considera que el mito en el que Crono devoraba a sus hijos procede d
2 CONC e esta religión primitiva, pues Ba`al Hammon era a v
2 CONT <p>eces adorado como Moloch, cuyo culto incluía el sacrificio de un niño quemándolo dentro de una estatua de Ba`al Hammon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Una versión atribuida por Eusebio al semilegendario historiador fenicio anterior a la Guerra de Troya Sanchoniaton señala que Crono fue originalmente un gobernante cananita que fundó Biblos y fu
2 CONC e posteriormente deificado. Esta versión da como nom
2 CONT <p>bre alternativo Elus o Ilus, y afirma que en 32º año de su reinado, castró, mató y deificó a su padre Epigeo o Autocton «a quien más tarde llamaron Urano». También afirma que tras la inven
2 CONC ción de los barcos, Crono, visitando el «mundo inhabitable
2 CONT <p>», legó el Ática a su propia hija Atenea y Egipto a Tot, el hijo de Misor e inventor de la escritura.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Crono es mencionado de nuevo en los Oráculos sibilinos, particularmente en el libro III, donde Crono, Titán y Jápeto, los tres hijos de Urano y Gea, reciben cada uno un tercio de la Tierra, y Cr
2 CONC ono es nombrado rey de todos. Tras la muerte de Uran
2 CONT <p>o, los hijos de Titán intentan destruir a la descendencia masculina de Crono y Rea tan pronto como nacen, pero en Dódona Rea da a luz en secreto a sus hijos Zeus, Poseidón y Hades, enviándolos 
2 CONC a Frigia para ser criados al cuidado de tres cretense

2 CONT <p> de este dios. Aunque la deidad romana Saturno se fundía ampliamente con Crono, los romanos favorecieron a Saturno mucho más que los griegos a Crono. Mientras Crono era considerado por los griego

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Es importante advertir que debido a las numerosas ciudades en las épocas antigua y clásica que estaban aisladas unas de otras, se desarrollaron diversos mitos adaptados a las regiones locales. A

2 CONC  Los documentos históricos revelan que esto es un suc

2 CONT <p>Como resultado de la importancia de Crono para los romanos, su variante romana, Saturno, ha tenido una influencia mayor en la cultura occidental. De acuerdo con la tradición de Oriente Próximo, e

2 CONT <p>He was one of the 12 Titans and the youngest son of Uranus and Gaea, the personifications of heaven and earth. The first sons of his parents were te three Hecatonchires, the 100-handed, 50-headed m
2 CONC onsters whom Uranus had imprisoned in a secret place. Gaea sought to rescue them and appealed for help from her other offspring, including the Cyclopses. Cronus alone accepted the challenge. He attack
2 CONC ed Uranus and wounded him severely; Cronus thus became the ruler of the universe.
2 CONT <p>Cronus had been warned that he would be overthrown by one of his children, and he swallowed each of his first five children as soon as it was born. Rhea, however, substituted a stone wrapped in swa
2 CONC ddling clothes for their sixth child, Zeus. Zeus was hidden in Crete, and when he was grown, with the aid of Gaea, forced Cronus to disgorge the other five children together with the stone. The stone 
2 CONC was later removed to Delphi. Zeus and his five brothers and sisters waged war on Cronus and the other Titans. Zeus was aided by the Hecatonchires and the Cyclopses, whom he freed from the prison where
2 CONC  they were kept by Cronus. Cronus and the Titans were thereafter confined inTartarus, a cave in the deepest part of the underworld.
2 CONT <p>The Roman counterpart of Cronus is Saturn, the god of sowing and seed. Earth, and some of the children of the 12. Often called the Elder Gods,they were for many ages the supreme rulers of the unive

2 CONT <p>Rhea (ancient Greek Ῥέα) was the Titaness daughter of Uranus, the sky, and Gaia, the earth, in classical Greek mythology. In earlier traditions, she was strongly associated with Gaia and Cybele
2 CONC , the Great Goddess and later seen by the classical Greeks as the mother of the major gods and goddesses. She became sister to Cronus and mother to Demeter, Hades, Hera, Hestia, Poseidon, and Zeus. In
2 CONC  Roman mythology, she was Magna Mater deorum Idaea and identified with Opis or, Ops.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In art, Rhea is usually depicted on a chariot drawn by two lions, and is not always distinguishable from Cybele.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cronus, Rhea's Titan brother and, later, husband, castrated their father, Uranus. After this, Cronus re-imprisoned the Hecatonchires, the Gigantes and the Cyclopes and set the monster Campe to guar
2 CONC d them. He and Rhea took the throne as King and Queen of the gods. This time was called the Golden Age.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cronus sired several children by Rhea: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, but swallowed them all as soon as they were born, since he had learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be
2 CONC  overcome by his own child as he had overthrown his own father. But when Zeus was about to be born, Rhea sought Uranus and Gaia to devise a plan to save him, so that Cronus would get his retribution f
2 CONC or his acts against Uranus and his own children. Rhea gave birth to Zeus in Crete, handing Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes which he promptly swallowed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En la mitología griega, la titánide Rea (en griego antiguo Ῥεία Reia, Ῥέα Rea, Ῥείη Reiē o Ῥέη Reē, ‘flujo menstrual o del líquido amniótico’ o ‘facilidad enel parto
2 CONC ) era hija de Urano y Gea, hermana y esposa de Crono, y madre con éste de Demét
2 CONT <p>er, Hades, Hera, Hestia, Poseidón y Zeus. Estaba fuertemente asociada a Cibeles, tanto que en obras de arte solía ser representada en un carro tirado por dos leones, y no siempre era posible dist
2 CONC inguirlas. En la mitología romana, fue la Magna Mat
2 CONT <p>er deorum Idaea y se le identificaba con Ops. Según Hesíodo fue nodriza de Dioniso.1 En la Antología Palatina se la menciona como nodriza de fieras y leones.2
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tras derrotar a Urano, su padre, Crono volvió a encarcelar a los Hecatónquiros, los Gigantes y los Cíclopes en el Tártaro, y dejó al monstruo Campe de carcelera. Él y Rea subieron al trono co
2 CONC mo reyes de los dioses. Esta época se denominó la edad
2 CONT <p> dorada, pues la gente de entonces no necesitaba leyes ni reglas: todos hacían lo correcto, por lo que no eran necesarias.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Crono fue padre de varios hijos de Rea: Hestia, Deméter, Hera, Hades y Poseidón, pero se los tragó tan pronto como nacieron, pues Gea y Urano le habían revelado que estaba destinado a serderroc
2 CONC ado por su propio hijo, tal como él había destronado
2 CONT <p> a su padre. Sin embargo, cuando Zeus estaba a punto de nacer, Rea pidió consejo a Urano y Gea para urdir un plan que le salvara, y así Crono tuviera el justo castigo a sus actos contra Urano y c
2 CONC ontra sus propios hijos. Rea se escondió en la isla
2 CONT <p> de Creta, donde dio a luz a Zeus. Luego engañó a Crono, dándole una piedra envuelta en pañales que éste tragó en seguida sin desconfiar.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Entonces escondió a Zeus en una cueva del monte Ida en Creta. De acuerdo a diversas versiones de esta historia, Zeus fue criado:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>   1. Por Gea.</p>
2 CONT <p>   2. Por una cabra llamada Amaltea, mientras una compañía de soldados llamados Curetes o Coribantes, o algunos dioses menores, bailaban, gritaban y daban palmadas para hacer ruido y que Crono no
2 CONC  oyese los llantos del niño.
2 CONT <p>   3. Por una ninfa llamada Adamantea. Puesto que Crono gobernaba la tierra, los cielos y el mar, ella le escondió colgándole con una cuerda de un árbol, de forma que quedaba suspendido entre la
2 CONC  tierra, el mar y el cielo, siendo pues invisible a
2 CONT <p> su padre.</p>
2 CONT <p>   4. Por una ninfa llamada Cinosura. En agradecimiento, Zeus la subió entre las estrellas tras su muerte.
2 CONT <p>   5. Por Melisa, quien lo alimentó con leche de cabra.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tras hacerse adulto, Zeus obligó a Crono a regurgitar a sus otros hijos en orden inverso al que los había tragado: primero la piedra, que se le dejó a Pitón bajo las cañadas del Parnaso como s
2 CONC eñal a los hombres mortales, y después al resto. En al

2 CONT <p>Notes for KING OF DARDANIA TROS:</p>
2 CONT <p>Two Ruling Houses  </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tros succeeded his father Erichthonius to the throne. He gave his name to the land (Troad) and to the people living in the Troad (Trojans). His son, Ganymede was so beautiful, that Zeus in the form
2 CONC  of an eagle, abducted the youth. Ganymede became the cupbearer in Olympus. Zeus gave Tros a couple of immortal horses and vine made of gold, to compensate for abducting the king's son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Dardanians people, was then divided into two separate groups, between his two other sons by Callirrhoë (Callirrhoe): Ilus and Assaracus. Assaracus succeeded his father and continued to rule at
2 CONC  Dardania, while Ilus chose to move closer to the sea. Ilus founded the city that he named Ilium, after himself. Ilium was, however, often called Troy, after his father. The two brothers began to rule
2 CONC  two separate houses.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the Dardanian line, Assaracus' son, Capys, married Themiste, daughter of Ilus and Eurydice. Capys became the father of Anchises. Anchises was a lover of Aphrodite, who bore him a son and hero, A
2 CONC eneas. Zeus struck Anchises with a thunderbolt, when he boasted of having slept with the love-goddess. He became a cripple, unable to walk. His son ruled Dardania in his place. Aeneas was the only lea
2 CONC der, who fought on the Trojan side, to survive the Trojan War.

2 CONT <p>She and her sisters were pursued by Orion, and turned into doves to preserve their safety.[5] According to the Homeric Hymn to Hermes Zeus, in the dead of night secretly begot Hermes upon Maia, who
2 CONC  avoided the company of the gods, in a cave of Cyllene. After giving birth to the baby, Maia wrapped him in blankets and went to sleep. The rapidly-maturing infant Hermes crawled away to Thessaly, whe

2 CONT <p>Maia also raised the infant Arcas[6] to protect him from Hera, who had turned his mother, Callisto into a bear. Arcas is the eponym of Arcadia.

2 CONT <p>In Roman mythology Maia was identified with Maia Maiestas (also called Fauna, Bona Dea (the 'Good Goddess') and Ops), a goddess who may be equivalent to an old Italic goddess of spring. The month o

2 CONT <p>Aegimius was the Greek mythological ancestor of the Dorians. He asked Heracles for help in a war against the Lapiths and, in gratitude, offered him one-third of his kingdom. Heracles refused and Ae
2 CONC gimius instead raised Heracles' son, Hyllas, alongside his own two sons, Dymas and Pamphylus, who both submitted to Hyllas after their father's death. The names of the three Dorian tribes are derived 
2 CONC from the three sons of Aegimius: Hylles, Dymanes and Pamphylii.
2 CONT <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 CONT <p>The Dorians</p>
2 CONT <p>The Dorians are best known for their invasion of mainland Greece which, along with the civil war at the end of the Mycenean, led to the Greek Dark Ages. The Dorians originated from north, northwest
2 CONC ern Greece, Macedonia and Epirus. From these points they began to invade toward the south, into the center of mainland Greece, and then to the Peloponnesian, and the southern Aegean islands. Once thei
2 CONC r invasions of central Greece ceased, their descent to southern Greece produced waves of invasions through the Peloponnesus, into Crete, and westward to Rhodes.

2 CONT <p>The Dorians themselves, were in many regards primitive compared to the Bronze Age Mycenean, and there are many hypotheses about their origins. The more mythical origins tells how the Dorians acquir
2 CONC ed their name from a small district in central Greece known as Doris. Accordingly, the Heraclidae, or three sons of Heracles, were driven from their home in Doris, by the Mycenean ruler Eurystheus. Th
2 CONC e Heraclidae took refuge with the king of Doris Aegimius. Later, the Heraclidae led a successful invasion of mainland Greece and reclaimed their heritage. The actual origins of the Dorians, unlike the
2 CONC  myth, remain quite obscure due to a general lack of archeological evidence during the Greek Dark Ages. It is, however, known that the Dorians did have knowledge of the iron slashing sword.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As mainland Greece gradually began to reclaim its urban heritage three centuries later, the Dorians primarily began settling in the south and eastern mainland of Greece. With the growth of classica
2 CONC l Greece, they created strong centers in Laconia (with its capital Sparta), Messenia, Argolis, and the Isthmus of Corinth. Dorian settlements also continued into the southern Aegean of Melos, Thera, R
2 CONC hodes, Cos, and Crete. In addition, the Dorians influence in the Aegean reached Halicarnassus and Cnidus (Turkey). By the 8th century BC, Dorian influence had spread to many parts of the Aegean, inclu
2 CONC ding Italy, the Crimea along the Black Sea, Corinth, and Argos.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As the Dorians settled many areas of the Aegean, their way of rulership, was generally to merge with the indigenous people of their land, as seen with the invasion of Corinth, Rhodes, and Argos. In
2 CONC  other instances however, such as in the case of Sparta and Crete, the Dorians kept power entirely to themselves, creating a ruling military class which they solely occupied. Such a political state, p
2 CONC urposefully "froze" the old archaic cultures of Ancient Greece to maintain dominion over a population decimated to serfdom. Regardless, Sparta was to remain the main city of the Dorians which lasted w
2 CONC ell into the age of classical Greece.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Doric language was a dialect spoken in Ancient Greece, overshadowed during the Classical Age by other dialects such as Ionic-Attic, Aeolic, and Arcado Cypriot, the latter dominating Greek language 
2 CONC from the 5th century BC onward. Dorian artistic elements proved to be integral to the artistic traditions of ancient Greece. Among the many artistic elements used by the Greeks, was the Doric architec
2 CONC tural element of large order and structure, which first originated within the populated cities of the southern Aegean. Other artistic contributions of the Dorians included the use of choral lyrics in 
2 CONC Greek Tragedy.

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} In Greek mythology, Hades kidnapped Persephone to be his wife. Zeus ordered Hades to return her to Demeter, the goddess of the Earth and her mother.  The myth of her abduction represen
2 CONC ts her function as the personification of vegetation which shoots forth in spring and withdraws into the earth after harvest; hence she is also associated with spring and with the seeds of the fruits 
2 CONC of the fields.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Persephone was such a beautiful young woman that everyone loved her, even Hades wanted her for himself. One day, when she was collecting flowers on the plain of Enna, the earth suddenly opened and 
2 CONC Hades rose up from the gap and abducted her. None but Zeus, and the all-seeing sun, Helios, had noticed it.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Broken-hearted, Demeter wandered the earth, looking for her daughter until Helios revealed what had happened. Demeter was so angry that she withdrew herself in loneliness, and the earth ceased to b
2 CONC e fertile.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Knowing this could not continue much longer, Zeus sent Hermes down to Hades to make him release Persephone. Hades grudgingly agreed, but before she went back he gave Persephone a pomegranate (or th
2 CONC e seeds of a pomegranate, according to some sources). When she later ate of it, it bound her to underworld forever and she had to stay there one-third of the year.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Persephone was in Hades, Demeter refused to let anything grow and winter began. This myth is a symbol of the budding and dying of nature.

2 CONT <p>Laomedon  </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the Trojan line, Ilus who was the founder and king of Troy, married Eurydice, and became the father of Laomedon. As it was said before, his daughter Themiste married his nephew, Capys (of the Da
2 CONC rdanian line). His son Laomedon succeeded Ilus. Of the two royal lines, those of Troy became more powerful than the older Dardanian line, under the rule of Laomedon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The new king married Strymo, Placia or Leucippe. Whichever woman he married, he was the father of Podarces (Priam) and many other sons. He had at least one daughter, Hesione. His son Tithonus was a
2 CONC bducted by Eos, goddess of dawn, and taken to Ethiopia, Syria. The goddess bore him a son Memnon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laomedon was known as the king, for his arrogance and impiety and who refused to honors his promises. Poseidon and Apollo, possibly punished for rebelling against Zeus, had to work for one year for
2 CONC  a mortal. The two gods disguised as builders, was hired to work alongside with a mortal, Aeacus, son of Zeus and Aegina, (father of Peleus and Telamon), to build the walls of Troy. Poseidon and Apoll
2 CONC o wanted the vine of gold as payment for their work. Laomedon agreed. After the gods finished building the wall, Laomedon refused to pay their wages for their services. Apollo caused the plague within
2 CONC  the city, while Poseidon send a sea-monster to ravage the Trojan countryside.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The seers told Laomedon, that land would be spare, if the king sacrifice his daughter to the sea-monster. Chaining his daughter, Hesione and waited for monster to arrive. Heracles, who was performi
2 CONC ng the ninth labour (fetching the girdle of Hippolyte), stopped at Troy. Learning what was about to happen, Heracles wanted Laomedon's immortal horses in exchange for rescuing his daughter. Laomedon a
2 CONC greed. After killing the monster, again Laomedon refused to pay. Heracles angry at the Trojan king betrayal on his promise, planned to return with an army, after he finish performing the twelve labour
2 CONC s.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Heracles raised an army in Tiryns, and the Argonaut hero, Telamon of Salamis, son of Aeacus. After capturing the city, Laomedon was killed, along with many of his sons, and Heracles gave Heisone to
2 CONC  Telamon as concubine. She allowed Hesione to ransomed one captive. Hesione ransomed her youngest brother Podarces, with her veil. Podarces became king of Troy, and changed his name to Priam (Ransom).

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ilus (Ilos in Greek) is in Greek mythology the founder of the city called Ilios or Ilion (Latinized as Ilium) to which he gave his name. When the latter became the chief city of the Trojan people i
2 CONC t was also often called Troy, the name by which it is best known today.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ilus was son and heir to Tros of Dardania and brother of Assaracus and Ganymede. He won the wrestling prize at games held by the King of Phrygia and received fifty youths and maidens as his reward.
2 CONC  The king also, on the advice of an oracle, gave him a cow and asked him to found a city where it should lie down. Ilus did so.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ilus then prayed to Zeus for a sign and at once saw the Palladium fallen from heaven and lying before his tent but was immediately blinded for the impiety of looking on the image. He regained his s
2 CONC ight after making offerings to Athena.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ilus preferred his new city of Ilium to Dardania and on his father's death he remained there, bestowing the rule of Dardania on his brother Assaracus instead and so the Trojans were split into two 
2 CONC kingdoms.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ilus was father of Laomedon who succeeded him. His wife was said to be either Eurydice (daughter of Adrastus), or Leucippe. Other children of Ilus include two daughters, Themiste (or Themis) and Te

2 CONT <p>Ilo (hijo de Tros)  [editar]Ilo (griego antiguo Ἶλος, Ilos en griego) es en la mitología griega el fundador mítico y epónimo de la ciudad llamada Ilión (latinizada como Ilium) del cual obt
2 CONC uvo su nombre. Cuando más tarde se convirtió en la capital de los troyanos fue llamada a menudo Troya, el nombre por el que es actualmente mejor conocida.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ilo era hijo y heredero del rey Tros de Dardania y de Calírroe. Estuvo casado con Eurídice, hija de Adrasto, de quien tuvo un hijo, Laomedonte, y una hija, Temiste.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ilo fue a Frigia, donde se celebraban unos juegos organizados por el rey y vención en la lucha libre y recibió como premio 50 muchachos y 50 muchachas. El rey además, por consejo de un oráculo,
2 CONC  le dio una vaca moteada y le dijo que fundara una ciudad donde el animal se tendiese. Ilo aceptó y la siguió.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cuando la vaca llegó a la colina llamada de Até («Locura», como la diosa epónima Até), en Frigia, se acostó. Allí Ilo fundó una ciudad que llamó Ilión.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ilo, entonces, rogó a Zeus que le mostrase una señal y vio delante de su tienda, caído del cielo, el Paladio (estatua que representa a Palas en armas); pero fue inmediatamente cegado, por la imp
2 CONC iedad de haber mirado la imagen. Recobró la vista después de hacer ofrendas a Atenea. Decidió erigir un templo consagrado a la diosa para honrarla (la estatua confería la inexpugnabiblidad a Troya
2 CONC ).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ilo prefirió su nueva ciudad de Ilión que Dardania , donde su padre permaneció hasta su muerte, y concedió el gobierno de Dardania a su hermano Asáraco y los troyanos fueron divididos en dos r
2 CONC einos.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ilo fue el padre de Laomedonte, el cual le sucedió. Se dice que su mujer era Eurídice (hija de Adrasto). La descendecnia de de Ilo incluía dos hijas, Temiste (o Temis) y Telecleia, quienes se ca
2 CONC saron con Capis y Cisseus, respectivamente.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En la Ilíada se hace referencias a su tumba, que se hallaba en la planicie de Troya cerca de un vado para cruzar el Escamandro.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ilus, son of Tros, founded the city of Ilium (Troy) that he called after himself. Ilus 2 went to Phrygia , and taking part in games that at the time were held by the king, he won a victory in wrest
2 CONC ling. As a prize, he received fifty youths and as many maidens, and the king, obeying an oracle, gave him also a cow, and asked him to found a city wherever the cow should lie down. The cow rested in 
2 CONC the hill of Ate, and in that spot Ilus built the city which he called Ilium. Then he prayed to Zeus that a sign might be shown to him, and he saw the Palladium fallen from heaven and lying before his 
2 CONC tent. Ilus was then blinded, for the Palladium might not be looked upon by any man. But later, when he had made offerings to the goddess, he recovered his sight.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In this way, the kingdom of Dardanus 1 and Erichthonius 1 was divided, because while Ilus 2 became king of Ilium (Troy), his brother Assaracus continued to be king of the Dardanians.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Troy (Asia Minor), also Ilium (ancient Ilion), famous city of Greek legend, on the northwestern corner of Asia Minor, in present-day Turkey. The legendary founder of the city was Ilus, the son of T
2 CONC ros, from whom the name Troy was derived. The son and successor of Ilus was Laomedon, who was slain by the hero Hercules, when Hercules captured the city. It was during the reign of Laomedon's son Pri
2 CONC am that the famous Trojan War occurred, which resulted in the capture and destruction of the city.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gen 90:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ilus, King of Troy, son of Tros and Callirhoe, was born 1281 BC, and married Eurydice of Troy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Eurydice of Troy.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>http://www.geocities.com/familyretzlaff/denmark.html</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Dardanian people, was then divided into two separate groups, between his two other sons by Callirrhoë (Callirrhoe): Ilus and Assaracus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Assaracus succeeded his father and continued to rule at Dardania, near Mount Ida, while Ilus (Ἴλος) chose to move closer to the sea. Ilus took part in games held by an unnamed Phrygian king, w
2 CONC here he won the wrestling match. His prize was fifty boys and fifty girls, as well as dappled cow. A seer told Ilus that he must follow the cow to where it lay down. The cow rested on the Hill of Phry
2 CONC gian Ate.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>That night, Ilus prayed for a favourable sign from Zeus, and that was when the wooden statuette of Athena, the Palladium, fell out of heaven, beside Ilus' tent. This Palladium would protect Troy fr
2 CONC om falling to the Greeks in the Trojan War, while the image remained in the city. With this sign, Ilus founded the city that he named Ilium, after himself. Ilium was, however, often called Troy, after
2 CONC  his father.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>So the two brothers began to rule two separate houses in two different cities.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the Trojan line, Ilus, who was the founder and king of Troy, married Eurydice, and became the father Laomedon. As it was said before, his daughter Themiste married his nephew, Capys (of the Dard
2 CONC anian line). His son Laomedon succeeded Ilus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the Dardanian line, Assaracus' son, Capys, married Themiste, daughter of Ilus and Eurydice. Capys became the father of Anchises.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anchises (Ἀγχίσης) was a lover of Aphrodite, who bore him a son and hero, Aeneas. Aphrodite warned Anchises not to reveal their relationship to anyone. But Anchises had forgotten her warnin
2 CONC g, when he became drunk one night. So Zeus struck Anchises with a thunderbolt, when he boasted of having slept with the love-goddess. He became a cripple, unable to walk.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His son ruled Dardania in his place. Aeneas was brave warrior and a pious leader. At first, Aeneas did not take part of the Trojan War, until Achilles invaded his land.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Troy fell in the war, Aeneas was the only leader to survive. Different authors give different accounts to his life after the war. According to the Roman poet Virgil, in The Aeneid, Aeneas esca
2 CONC ped captured with his father and son, and travelled to Latium, Italy. Anchises died before they Latium, in Eryx, Sicily. Aeneas won the right to stay in Latium, when he became victor in the war agains
2 CONC t the Latins. See Aeneas, for more detail about Aeneas' life.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Of the two royal lines, those of Troy (Ilium) became more powerful than the older Dardanian line, under the rule of Laomedon, but there was only three generations of kings in Troy (compare to Darda
2 CONC nia having eight kings).

2 CONT <p>Fortellingen om trojanerne begynte først i myter og legender. Gresk mytologi sier at trojanerne var de opprinnelige borgerne i byen Troja i Troas-regionen i Anatolia (nå Tyrkia). Troja ligger i A

2 CONT <p>Den trojanske kongefamilien startet med Elektra og Zevs, foreldrene til Dardanos. Dardanos var ifølge greske myter opprinnelig fra Arkadia, men ifølge romerske myter var han opprinnelig fra Itali

2 CONC e og grunnla Dardania som sener ble styrt av Aineias. Da Dardanos døde gikk kongedømmet videre til hans barnebarn Tros som kalte folket trojanere og landet Troas etter seg selv. Ilos, sønn av Tros,
2 CONC  grunnla byen Ilium som han oppkalte etter seg selv. Zevs gav Ilos Palladium. Poseidon og Apollon bygget murene og befestningene rundt Troja for Laomedon, sønn av Ilos den yngre. Da Laomedon nektet 
2 CONC  betale, oversvømmet Poseidon landet og krevde at Hesione skulle ofres til sjøuhyre. Pestilense kom og sjøuhyret tok menneskene på sletten.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En generasjon før Trojanerkrigen erobret Herakles Troja og drepte Laomedon og hans sønner, med unntak av den unge Priam. Priam ble senere konge. Under hans styre invaderte de mykenske grekerne og
2 CONC  erobret Troja i Trojanerkrigen, tradisjonelt datert til 1193–1183 f.Kr. maksyanerne var en vestlig libyisk stamme som sa at de var etterkommere av mennene fra Troja, ifølge Herodot. De trojanske s
2 CONC kipene forandret seg til najader som gledet seg over å se ødeleggelsen av Odyssevs' skip.

2 CONT <p>Trojansk styre i Lille-Asia ble erstattet av herakleide-dynastiet i Sardis som hersket i 505 år frem til Kandaules. jonerne, kimmererne, frygierne, miletene fra Sinope og lydierne flyttet inn i Li

2 CONT <p>Ilus (Ilos in Greek) is in Greek mythology the founder of the city called Ilion (latinized as Ilium) to which he gave his name. When the latter became the chief city of the Trojan people it was als

2 CONT <p>Ilus then prayed to Zeus for a sign and at once saw the Palladium fallen from heaven and lying before his tent but was immediately blinded for the impiety of looking on the image. He regained his s

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ilus preferred his new city of Ilium to Dardania and on his father's death he remained there, bestowing the rule of Dardania on his brother Assaracus instead and so the Trojans were split into two

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ilus was father of Laomedon who succeeded him. His wife was said to be Eurydice (daughter of Adrastus). Other children of Ilus include two daughters, Themiste (or Themis) and Telecleia, who married

2 CONT <p>Two Ruling Houses  </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tros succeeded his father Erichthonius to the throne. He gave his name to the land (Troad) and to the people living in the Troad (Trojans). His son, Ganymede was so beautiful, that Zeus in the form
2 CONC  of an eagle, abducted the youth. Ganymede became the cupbearer in Olympus. Zeus gave Tros a couple of immortal horses and vine made of gold, to compensate for abducting the king's son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Dardanians people, was then divided into two separate groups, between his two other sons by Callirrhoë (Callirrhoe): Ilus and Assaracus. Assaracus succeeded his father and continued to rule at
2 CONC  Dardania, while Ilus chose to move closer to the sea. Ilus founded the city that he named Ilium, after himself. Ilium was, however, often called Troy, after his father. The two brothers began to rule
2 CONC  two separate houses.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the Dardanian line, Assaracus' son, Capys, married Themiste, daughter of Ilus and Eurydice. Capys became the father of Anchises. Anchises was a lover of Aphrodite, who bore him a son and hero, A
2 CONC eneas. Zeus struck Anchises with a thunderbolt, when he boasted of having slept with the love-goddess. He became a cripple, unable to walk. His son ruled Dardania in his place. Aeneas was the only lea
2 CONC der, who fought on the Trojan side, to survive the Trojan War.

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} CLYMENE was one of the Oceanides, a daughter of Oceanus and Tethys. By her uncle Iapetus she was the mother of Atlas, Prometheus, Menoetius, and Epimetheus. Iapetus was regarded as the
2 CONC  ancestor of the human race, although it was his son Prometheus who fashioned men out of clay. It is to be expected that there was confusion in the genealogies of the beings involved in setting up the
2 CONC  world. Clymene was also called the mother by Prometheus of Hellen and Deucalion. This mother/son liason would not be particularly usual in the confusing descent of the gods, but Prometheus' wife was 
2 CONC usually called Celaeno. Somewhere along the way, probably after the confinement of Iapetus in Tartarus with other Titans, Clymene married Merops, a king of the Ethiopians. Clymene was unfaithful to hi
2 CONC m and gave herself to her cousin (and brother-in-law) Helios, the sun. By him she had the Heliades and Phaethon. Clymene's children were pivotal in the contest of the gods against the Titans and in th
2 CONC e development of the human race. Atlas and Menoetius were both punished for their roles in the conflict with the Olympians. Atlas was condemned to bear the heavens on his head and shoulders, but not b
2 CONC efore he became father of the Pleiades, the Hyades, the Hesperides, and other beings. Menoetius was struck by Zeus with a thunderbolt and thrown into Tartarus. Prometheus and Epimetheus were the paren
2 CONC ts of Deucalion and Pyrrha, respectively, and these offspring were responsible for repopulating the earth after the great flood. For going contrary to the will of Zeus in regard to the human race, Pro
2 CONC metheus was punished atop Mount Caucasus by having his liver pecked out daily by an eagle and having it restored each successive day. Pandora, the wife of Epimetheus, let loose all the troubles of the
2 CONC  world by opening a forbidden chest. Phaethon, the son of Clymene and Helios, almost caused the destruction of the world. He begged his father to let him drive the chariot of the sun across heaven. He
2 CONC  proved too weak to handle the dazzling horses, and the chariot fell toward the earth. Zeus struck him from the chariot, and he plummeted to earth. Helios recovered the reins in time to keep the earth
2 CONC  from burning to a cinder. Phaethon's mother was also called Merope, Prote, or Rhode. [Hesiod, Theogony 351,507; Hyginus, Fables 156; Apollodorus 1.2.3; Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.763, Tristia 3.4.30.]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>PANDORA over the centuries has become a kind of equivalent of Eve, the first created woman. Much blame was assigned to both because of a foolish mistake (provided we remove the element of destiny).
2 CONC  Pandora, whose name literally meant All Gifts, came into being when Zeus had her created by the master artisan Hephaestus to punish Prometheus for stealing fire from heaven. Right there we have an an
2 CONC omaly, since the theft of fire presupposed an already existing population of the earth. But perhaps only males existed at that point, and Zeus had other ideas for propagation. It is interesting that h
2 CONC e saw the creation of a woman as a punishment. Whatever the reason, Pandora was created as the first woman, and all the gods came forward to endow her with gifts. Aphrodite gave her beauty, Hermes gav
2 CONC e her cunning, and other gods and goddesses gave her various powers that Zeus had calculated to bring about the ruin of man. Finally he had Hermes deliver her to Epimetheus, the not-so-bright brother 
2 CONC of Prometheus. Epimetheus was utterly charmed by this marvelous creation, although he had been warned by Prometheus never to accept a gift from Zeus. He forgot his promise to his brother to think befo
2 CONC re acting, because Aphrodite's gift had certainly included the ability of Pandora to give her husband ultimate sexual pleasure. Life was happy for Pandora and especially so for Epimetheus. But already
2 CONC  destiny was at work. In the house was a covered earthen vessel (or box or chest) that either had been placed in the safekeeping of Epimetheus or given to Pandora along with other gifts. In either cas
2 CONC e it was forbidden to open it. But its unknown contents plagued Pandora (she had been given curiosity along with everything else). One day while Epimetheus was away, she could stand the temptation no 
2 CONC longer and peeked into the vessel. She found out soon enough why she should not have opened the pot, for out swarmed all the calamities of mankind--from tidal waves to premature balding. It was too la
2 CONC te to stop them as they spread out through the window and across the world. Pandora dropped the lid back in time to prevent the excape of the final occupant of the vessel. This was Elpis, and no matte
2 CONC r how bad things became for people then and in the future, there was always hope. Pandora became the mother of Pyrrha by Epimetheus. Pyrrha married Deucalion, son of Prometheus, and these two people r
2 CONC epopulated the earth when Zeus, finally disgusted with man, sent a flood to wipe out the human race. There is no record of Pandora's final history. It is not really certain whether or not she was cons
2 CONC idered immortal. In later writings she became associated with infernal divinities such as Hecate, Persephone, and the Erinyes. In one or two versions of the allegory, Pandora brought the fatal vessel 
2 CONC Epimetheus and, using her newly fashioned wiles, prevaied upon him to open it. It is interesting to observe the parallel of this story to that of Eve in the garden of Eden urging Adam to taste the for
2 CONC bidden apple. Some said the vessel contained only benefits for mankind, but these were allowed to escape. In any case, the result was intended to be the same. The birth of Pandora was represented on t
2 CONC he pedestal of the statue of Athena in the Parthenon. [Hesiod, Theogony 571, Works and Days 30,50,96; Hyginus, Fables 142; Apollodorus 1.7.2; Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.350; Orphica, Argonautica 974.] Chan

2 CONT <p>Thebes (pronounced /ˈθiːbz/ or thēbz; Greek: Θῆβαι, Thēbai, IPA: [tʰɛ́ː̀ba͝ɪ]; Modern Greek: Θήβα, Thiva, [ˈθiva]) is a city in Greece, situated to the north of the Cithaero
2 CONC n range, which divides Boeotia from Attica, and on the southern edge of the Boeotian plain. It played an important role in Greek myth, as the site of the stories of Cadmus, Oedipus, Dionysus and other
2 CONC s. Archaeological excavations in and around Thebes have revealed a Mycenaean settlement and clay tablets written in the Linear B script, indicating the importance of the site in the Bronze Age. In anc
2 CONC ient times, Thebes was the largest city of the region of Boeotia and was the leader of the Boeotian confederacy. It was a major rival of ancient Athens, and sided with the Persians during the 480 BC i
2 CONC nvasion of Xerxes. Theban forces ended the power of Sparta at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC under the command of Epaminondas. The Sacred Band of Thebes (an elite military unit) famously fell at the 
2 CONC battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC against Philip II and Alexander the Great. Prior to its destruction by Alexander in 335 BC, Thebes was a major force in Greek history, and was the most dominant city-stat
2 CONC e at the time of the Macedonian conquest of Greece. During the Byzantine period, the city was famous for its silks. The modern city contains an Archaeological Museum, the remains of the Cadmea (Bronze
2 CONC  Age and forward citadel), and scattered ancient remains. Modern Thebes is the largest town of the Boeotia Prefecture. It is situated at highway E962, some 4 km south of the junction with E75.

2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Amphion and Zethus (also Zethos), in ancient Greek mythology, were the twin sons of Zeus by Antiope. They are important characters in one of the two founding myths of the city of Thebes, because th
2 CONC ey constructed the city's walls.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Amphion and Zethus were the sons of Antiope, who fled in shame to Sicyon after Zeus raped her, and married King Epopeus there. However, either Nycteus or Lycus attacked Sicyon in order to carry her
2 CONC  back to Thebes and punish her. On the way back, she gave birth to the twins and was forced to expose them on Mount Cithaeron. Lycus gave her to his wife, Dirce, who treated her very cruelly for many 
2 CONC years.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiope eventually escaped and found her sons living near Mount Cithaeron. After they were convinced that she was their mother, they killed Dirce by tying her to the horns of a bull, gathered an ar
2 CONC my, and conquered Thebes, becoming its joint rulers.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Amphion became a great singer and musician after Hermes taught him to play and gave him a golden lyre. Zethus became a hunter and herdsman, with a great interest in cattle breeding. They built the 
2 CONC walls around the Cadmea, the citadel of Thebes. While Zethus struggled to carry his stones, Amphion played his lyre and his stones followed after him and gently glided into place.[2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Amphion married Niobe, the daughter of Tantalus, the Lydian king. Because of this, he learned to play his lyre in the Lydian mode and added three strings to it.[3] Zethus married Thebe, after whom 
2 CONC the city of Thebes was named.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mphion's wife Niobe had many children, but had become arrogant and because of this she insulted the goddess Leto, who had only two children, Artemis and Apollo. Leto's children killed Niobe's child
2 CONC ren in retaliation (see Niobe). In Ovid, Amphion commits suicide out of grief; according to Telesilla, Artemis and Apollo murder him along with his children. Hyginus, however, writes that in his madne
2 CONC ss he tried to attack the temple of Apollo, and was killed by the god's arrows.[4]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Zethus had only one son, who died through a mistake of his mother Thebe, causing Zethus to kill himself.[2] In the Odyssey, however, Zethus's wife is called a daughter of Pandareus in book 19, who

2 CONT <p>Amphion and Zethus (also Zethos), in ancient Greek mythology, were the twin sons of Zeus by Antiope. They are important characters in one of the two founding myths of the city of Thebes, because th
2 CONC ey constructed the city's walls.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Amphion and Zethus were the sons of Antiope, who fled in shame to Sicyon after Zeus raped her, and married King Epopeus there. However, either Nycteus or Lycus attacked Sicyon in order to carry her
2 CONC  back to Thebes and punish her. On the way back, she gave birth to the twins and was forced to expose them on Mount Cithaeron. Lycus gave her to his wife, Dirce, who treated her very cruelly for many 
2 CONC years.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiope eventually escaped and found her sons living near Mount Cithaeron. After they were convinced that she was their mother, they killed Dirce by tying her to the horns of a bull, gathered an ar
2 CONC my, and conquered Thebes, becoming its joint rulers.[1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Amphion became a great singer and musician after Hermes taught him to play and gave him a golden lyre. Zethus became a hunter and herdsman, with a great interest in cattle breeding. They built the 
2 CONC walls around the Cadmea, the citadel of Thebes. While Zethus struggled to carry his stones, Amphion played his lyre and his stones followed after him and gently glided into place.[2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Amphion married Niobe, the daughter of Tantalus, the Lydian king. Because of this, he learned to play his lyre in the Lydian mode and added three strings to it.[3] Zethus married Thebe, after whom 
2 CONC the city of Thebes was named.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>mphion's wife Niobe had many children, but had become arrogant and because of this she insulted the goddess Leto, who had only two children, Artemis and Apollo. Leto's children killed Niobe's child
2 CONC ren in retaliation (see Niobe). In Ovid, Amphion commits suicide out of grief; according to Telesilla, Artemis and Apollo murder him along with his children. Hyginus, however, writes that in his madne
2 CONC ss he tried to attack the temple of Apollo, and was killed by the god's arrows.[4]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Zethus had only one son, who died through a mistake of his mother Thebe, causing Zethus to kill himself.[2] In the Odyssey, however, Zethus's wife is called a daughter of Pandareus in book 19, who 
2 CONC killed her son Itylos in a fit of madness and became a nightingale.[5]

2 CONT <p>Deméter é a deusa da terra cultivada, das colheitas e das estações do ano. É propiciadora do trigo, planta símbolo da civilização. Na qualidade de deusa da agricultura, fez várias e longas

2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p>Dans la mythologie grecque, Déméter (en grec ancien Δημήτηρ / Dêmếtêr qui dérive de Γῆ Μήτηρ / Gễ Mếtêr, « la Terre-Mère » ou de Δημομήτηρ / Dêmomếtêr, «
2 CONC  la Mère de la Terre », de δῆμος / dễmos, « la terre, le pays ») est la déesse de l'agriculture et des moissons. Les Romains l'associèrent à Cérès. La Théogonie d'Hésiode en fait un

2 CONT <p>Août — Le Triomphe de Céres, par Tura Cosmè (v. 1476–1484)</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Quand Hadès, souverain des morts, enleva Perséphone pour en faire son épouse, Déméter partit à sa recherche et négligea les récoltes de la Terre. En prenant la forme d'une vieille femme nom
2 CONC mée « Doso », elle erra pendant neuf jours. Se rendant compte qu'une famine menaçait les mortels, Zeus se décida à envoyer Hermès au royaume d'Hadès pour lui demander de rendre Perséphone à 
2 CONC sa mère. Mais Perséphone avait mangé six pépins de la grenade offerte par Hadès en guise de dernière ruse pour la garder avec lui, et la tradition voulait que quiconque mangeant dans le royaume 
2 CONC des morts ne puisse le quitter. Zeus s'entendit pour que Perséphone passe les six mois cultivables sur la Terre avec sa mère et les six mois du reste de l'année avec son époux. C'est de ce mythe q
2 CONC u'est né le cycle des saisons dans la mythologie grecque.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mais Déméter n'eut pas que Perséphone. Le héros Iasion s'unit à elle dans un champ labouré trois fois et lui donna un fils qui fut appelé Ploutos et devint la personnification de la richesse
2 CONC . Homère mentionne que Zeus, par jalousie, foudroya Iasos. Unie à Poséidon, elle conçut aussi Arion, un cheval immortel, et une déesse mystérieuse, dont il était interdit de prononcer le nom : 
2 CONC aussi désignait-on cette fille de Déméter sous le vocable de Despina (« la Maîtresse ») 1. La légende rapporte qu'ayant conçu Despina durant sa quête de Perséphone, Déméter la fit élever 
2 CONC par un Titan du nom d'Anytos2.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Déméter enseigna aux humains le travail des semis et du labour. Durant son errance sous la forme de Doso, elle rencontra Céléos, roi d'Éleusis. Pour le remercier de son accueil, elle prit avec
2 CONC  elle les fils du roi, Démophon et Triptolème, tenta de rendre le premier immortel et enseigna au second l'art de l'agriculture. Celui-ci devait en retour enseigner cet art au reste des humains. Cer
2 CONC taines traditions mentionnent qu'elle lui aurait aussi donné des grains de blé afin qu'il les répande sur la Terre.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dans Les Travaux et les Jours, Hésiode revient fréquemment sur Déméter, et il y donne de nombreux détails sur les rites religieux entourant la fertilité et le travail de la terre. On reconna
2 CONC t que cette déesse est l'une des divinités les plus favorables aux humains et qu'elle se réjouit dans la paix et le labeur. Plusieurs auteurs s'entendent pour dire qu'elle ne faisait pas partie de
2 CONC s douze dieux de l'Olympe, puisqu'elle préfèrerait rester près de la terre et des champs.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selon Pausanias dans sa Description de la Grèce, une grande quantité de temples et sanctuaires dédiés à Déméter parsemaient le pays, témoignant de l'importance de son culte.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Déméter fut honorée dans les mystères d'Éleusis, un culte célébrant le retour à la vie et le cycle des moissons. L'Hymne homérique à Déméter, donne la meilleure description qui puisse n

2 CONT <p>The mythical King Erichthonius of Dardania was the son of Dardanus or Darda, King of Dardania, and Batea, (although some legends say his mother was Olizone, descendant of Phineus).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Fundamentally, all that is known of this Erichthonius comes from Homer, who says (Samuel Butler's translation of Iliad 20.215-234):
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"In the beginning Dardanos was the son of Zeus, and founded Dardania, for Ilion was not yet established on the plain for men to dwell in, and her people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained 
2 CONC Ida. Dardanos had a son, king Erichthonios, who was wealthiest of all men living; he had three thousand mares that fed by the water-meadows, they and their foals with them. Boreas was enamored of them
2 CONC  as they were feeding, and covered them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. Twelve filly foals did they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped over the fertile plain, would go bounding 
2 CONC on over the ripe ears of wheat and not break them; or again when they would disport themselves on the broad back of Ocean they could gallop on the crest of a breaker. Erichthonios begat Tros, king of 
2 CONC the Trojans,and Tros had three noble sons, Ilos, Assarakos, and Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the gods carried him off to be Zeus' cupbearer, for his beauty's sake, that he might
2 CONC  dwell among the immortals."

2 CONT <p>Death noted on Lewis Ancestry as 1414 BC Hecataeus of Abdera, a fourth-century B.C. Greek historian, states that "Now the Egyptians say that also after these events [the plagues of Exodus] a great 
2 CONC number of colonies were SPREAD FROM EGYPT all over the inhabited world...They say also that those who set forth with DANAUS, likewise from Egypt, settled what is practically the oldest city of Greece,
2 CONC  Argos, and that the nations of the COLCHI IN PONTUS and that of the Jews (remnant of Judah), which lies BETWEEN ARABIA AND SYRIA, were founded as colonies by certain emigrants from their country [Egy
2 CONC pt]; and this is the reason why it is a long-established institution among these peoples to CIRCUMCISE their male children, the custom having been brought over FROM EGYPT. Even the ATHENIANS, they say
2 CONC , are colonists from SAIS IN EGYPT." (Quoted from Diodorus of Sicily. G. H. Oldfather, 1933. Vol I, bks I-II, 1-34, p.91). An examination of some of the historical clues reveals that there lived in Eg
2 CONC ypt -- during the time of the bondage of the Israelites -- a man named DARDA. According to E. Raymond Capt, "Darda, "the Egyptian," (son of Zarah) was "DARDANUS," the EGYPTIAN FOUNDER OF TROY." (Jacob
2 CONC 's Pillar. Artisan Sales, Thousand Oaks, CA. 1977. P. 25). The early migration of Darda is noted in the book How Israel Came to Britain: Actually, groups of Israelites began to migrate away from the m
2 CONC ain body BEFORE THE ISRAEL NATION WAS FORMED -- while, as a people, they were STILL IN BONDAGE IN EGYPT. One of these groups under the leadership of Calcol, a prince of the tribe of Judah, went westwa
2 CONC rd across the Mediterranean eventually settling in Ulster [Ireland]. ANOTHER, under the leadership of DARDANUS, a brother of Calcol, CROSSED TO ASIA MINOR to found the Kingdom later known as TROY. --

2 CONT <p>Fortellingen om trojanerne begynte først i myter og legender. Gresk mytologi sier at trojanerne var de opprinnelige borgerne i byen Troja i Troas-regionen i Anatolia (nå Tyrkia). Troja ligger i A

2 CONC e og grunnla Dardania som sener ble styrt av Aineias. Da Dardanos døde gikk kongedømmet videre til hans barnebarn Tros som kalte folket trojanere og landet Troas etter seg selv. Ilos, sønn av Tros,
2 CONC  grunnla byen Ilium som han oppkalte etter seg selv. Zevs gav Ilos Palladium. Poseidon og Apollon bygget murene og befestningene rundt Troja for Laomedon, sønn av Ilos den yngre. Da Laomedon nektet 
2 CONC  betale, oversvømmet Poseidon landet og krevde at Hesione skulle ofres til sjøuhyre. Pestilense kom og sjøuhyret tok menneskene på sletten.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En generasjon før Trojanerkrigen erobret Herakles Troja og drepte Laomedon og hans sønner, med unntak av den unge Priam. Priam ble senere konge. Under hans styre invaderte de mykenske grekerne og

2 CONT <p>Dardanerna (på grekiska dardanioi eller dardanoi; på albanska dardani eller dardanët) var ett antikt folkslag som bland annat nämns i Homeros' Illiaden där de var Trojas allierade. Deras ledar

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>"In the beginning Dardanos was the son of Zeus, and founded Dardania, for Ilion was not yet established on the plain for men to dwell in, and her people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained 
2 CONC Ida. Dardanos had a son, king Erichthonios, who was wealthiest of all men living; he had three thousand mares that fed by the water-meadows, they and their foals with them. Boreas was enamored of them
2 CONC  as they were feeding, and covered them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. Twelve filly foals did they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped over the fertile plain, would go bounding 
2 CONC on over the ripe ears of wheat and not break them; or again when they would disport themselves on the broad back of Ocean they could gallop on the crest of a breaker. Erichthonios begat Tros, king of 
2 CONC the Trojans,and Tros had three noble sons, Ilos, Assarakos, and Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the gods carried him off to be Zeus' cupbearer, for his beauty's sake, that he might
2 CONC  dwell among the immortals."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>John Tzetzes and one of the scholia to Lycophron call his wife Astyoche, daughter of Simoeis. Apollodorus also adds Erichthonius' older brother Ilus, who died young and childless; presumably a doub
2 CONC let of the other Ilus, grandson of Erichthonius, eponym of Troy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Strabo (13.1.48) records, but discounts, the claim by "some more recent writers" that Teucer came from the deme of Xypeteones in Attica, supposedly called Troes (meaning Trojans) in mythical times.
2 CONC  These writers mentioned that Erichthonius appears as founder both in Attica and the Troad, and may be identifying the two.

2 CONT <p>Ilos is believed to be the founder of the capital city of Troy, Illiona. Archaologists spent a great deal of time searching for the city of Troy, and had about decided that it didn't really exist. 
2 CONC They later descovered that the city was never named Troy, but Illiona, just as in Homer's Illiad. The city they found had been built, destroyed, and rebuilt several times over several hundred years by
2 CONC  the Greeks, Romans, Persians, and Trojans. Much of the more realistic depictions of the battle as described in the Illiad have since been accepted as historically correct.

2 CONT <p>Fortellingen om trojanerne begynte først i myter og legender. Gresk mytologi sier at trojanerne var de opprinnelige borgerne i byen Troja i Troas-regionen i Anatolia (nå Tyrkia). Troja ligger i A

2 CONC nsive murer.

2 CONT <p>Den trojanske kongefamilien startet med Elektra og Zevs, foreldrene til Dardanos. Dardanos var ifølge greske myter opprinnelig fra Arkadia, men ifølge romerske myter var han opprinnelig fra Itali
2 CONC a, krysset over til Lille-Asia fra øya Samotrake hvor han møtte kong Teukros. Teukros var selv kolonist fra Attika og behandlet Dardanos med respekt. Til slutt giftet Dardanos seg med Teukros' døtr
2 CONC e og grunnla Dardania som sener ble styrt av Aineias. Da Dardanos døde gikk kongedømmet videre til hans barnebarn Tros som kalte folket trojanere og landet Troas etter seg selv. Ilos, sønn av Tros,
2 CONC  grunnla byen Ilium som han oppkalte etter seg selv. Zevs gav Ilos Palladium. Poseidon og Apollon bygget murene og befestningene rundt Troja for Laomedon, sønn av Ilos den yngre. Da Laomedon nektet 
2 CONC  betale, oversvømmet Poseidon landet og krevde at Hesione skulle ofres til sjøuhyre. Pestilense kom og sjøuhyret tok menneskene på sletten.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En generasjon før Trojanerkrigen erobret Herakles Troja og drepte Laomedon og hans sønner, med unntak av den unge Priam. Priam ble senere konge. Under hans styre invaderte de mykenske grekerne og
2 CONC  erobret Troja i Trojanerkrigen, tradisjonelt datert til 1193–1183 f.Kr. maksyanerne var en vestlig libyisk stamme som sa at de var etterkommere av mennene fra Troja, ifølge Herodot. De trojanske s
2 CONC kipene forandret seg til najader som gledet seg over å se ødeleggelsen av Odyssevs' skip.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Trojansk styre i Lille-Asia ble erstattet av herakleide-dynastiet i Sardis som hersket i 505 år frem til Kandaules. jonerne, kimmererne, frygierne, miletene fra Sinope og lydierne flyttet inn i Li

2 CONC  sted, de greske gudene så på Trojanerkrigen, Hera distraherte Zevs med sin forførelse lenge nok til at akhaiene, hjulpet av Poseidon, kunne holde trojanerne borte fra sine skip og hvor Aineias og 
2 CONC hans tilhengere hvilte og ventet til grekerne satte av gårde til Hellas. Alteret til Panomfean (kilden til alle orakler) ble dedikert til Jupiter (Tonatos) nær Troja. Buthrotos (eller Buthrotum) var

2 CONT <p>Troja var enligt den grekiska mytologin huvudstad i Dardanien som etablerades av kung Dardanus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Senare forskning har kunnat knyta namnet Ilion till det historiska namnet Wilusa, och man antar idag att det är samma stat som avses. Wilusa är omnämnd i hettitiska texter. Man antar därför at
2 CONC t det språk som ursprungligen talades i Troja var luviska snarare än grekiska. Söder om Troja låg under den sena bronsåldern landet Arzawa. Det är möjligt att Homeros skildring av det trojanska
2 CONC  kriget har sin historiska bakgrund i de strider som förekom mellan staterna utmed den egeiska kusten omkring 1300-1200 f.Kr. vilka även drog in det historiska Troja (se Hettiterriket).

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia: In Greek mythology, Tros was a ruler of Troy and the son of Erichthonius by Astyoche (daughter of the river god Simoeis) or of Ilus I, from whom he inherited the throne.[1][2] Tros 
2 CONC was the father of three sons: Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymedes, and of a daughter Cleopatra.[3] He is the eponym of Troy, also named Ilion for his son Ilus. Tros's wife was said to be Callirrhoe, daught
2 CONC er of the River God Scamander[3], or Acallaris, daughter of Eumedes[4].
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Zeus abducted Ganymedes, Tros grieved for his son. Sympathetic, Zeus sent Hermes with two horses so swift they could run over water. Hermes also assured Tros that Ganymede was immortal and wou

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In variant versions Ganymede is son of Laomedon son of Ilus son of Tros;[7] yet others call him son of Ilus[8], Erichthonius or Assaracus[9].

2 CONT <p>It was from Tros that the Dardanians were called Trojans and the land named the Troad.

2 CONT <p>Historia [redigera] Staden är känd från Homeros epos Iliaden och Odysséen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Troja var enligt den grekiska mytologin huvudstad i Dardanien som etablerades av kung Dardanus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Senare forskning har kunnat knyta namnet Ilion till det historiska namnet Wilusa, och man antar idag att det är samma stat som avses. Wilusa är omnämnd i hettitiska texter. Man antar därför at
2 CONC t det språk som ursprungligen talades i Troja var luviska snarare än grekiska. Söder om Troja låg under den sena bronsåldern landet Arzawa. Det är möjligt att Homeros skildring av det trojanska
2 CONC  kriget har sin historiska bakgrund i de strider som förekom mellan staterna utmed den egeiska kusten omkring 1300-1200 f.Kr. vilka även drog in det historiska Troja (se Hettiterriket).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Staden [redigera] Runt år 1865 återupptäcktes den antika staden av den brittiske arkeologen Frank Calvert som gjorde utgrävningar i ruinhögen vid Hisarlik. Identifieringen av Hisarlik som det 
2 CONC homeriska Troja blev känd genom den tyska arkeologen Heinrich Schliemann, som trodde sig ha funnit Priamos skatt under sina grävningar där. Området visar spår från 9 olika byggperioder.

2 CONC  honour.  The soothsayers were not wrong in their forecast.  When the day came for her to have her child, the mother bore a son and died in childbirth.  The boy was handed over to the midwife and was

2 CONT <p>Notes for KING OF DARDANIA TROS:</p>
2 CONT <p>Two Ruling Houses  </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tros succeeded his father Erichthonius to the throne. He gave his name to the land (Troad) and to the people living in the Troad (Trojans). His son, Ganymede was so beautiful, that Zeus in the form
2 CONC  of an eagle, abducted the youth. Ganymede became the cupbearer in Olympus. Zeus gave Tros a couple of immortal horses and vine made of gold, to compensate for abducting the king's son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Dardanians people, was then divided into two separate groups, between his two other sons by Callirrhoë (Callirrhoe): Ilus and Assaracus. Assaracus succeeded his father and continued to rule at
2 CONC  Dardania, while Ilus chose to move closer to the sea. Ilus founded the city that he named Ilium, after himself. Ilium was, however, often called Troy, after his father. The two brothers began to rule
2 CONC  two separate houses.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the Dardanian line, Assaracus' son, Capys, married Themiste, daughter of Ilus and Eurydice. Capys became the father of Anchises. Anchises was a lover of Aphrodite, who bore him a son and hero, A
2 CONC eneas. Zeus struck Anchises with a thunderbolt, when he boasted of having slept with the love-goddess. He became a cripple, unable to walk. His son ruled Dardania in his place. Aeneas was the only lea
2 CONC der, who fought on the Trojan side, to survive the Trojan War.

2 CONT <p>Notes for KING OF DARDANIA DARDA-DARDANUS:</p>
2 CONT <p>Greek Mythology:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The son of Zeus (Roman name is Jupiter) and Electra. He sailed from Samothrace to Troad in a raft made of hides. Once he arrived there, he founded the city of Dardania (the later, ill-fated city of
2 CONC  Troy).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Trojans were also descendants of Atlas. Dardanus 1, son of Electra 3, daughter of Atlas, is the beginning of the house of Troy, for Dardanus 1 is father of Erichthonius 1, father of Tros 1, aft
2 CONC er whom the Trojans are called, father of Ilus 2, founder of Ilium (Troy), father of Laomedon 1, father of Priam 1, the one who reigned when the city was destroyed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>---</p>
2 CONT <p>Dardanus fled from Arcadia across the sea to Samothrace. When that island was visited by a flood, he crossed over to the Troad, a region surrounding Troy in Asia Minor. Being hospitably received by
2 CONC  Teucer (ruler of Phrygia), he married Teucer's daughter Bateia and became the founder of the royal house of Troy.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>---</p>
2 CONT <p>DARDANUS, in Greek mythology, ancestor of the Trojans and son of the god Zeus and the nymph Electra. He married the daughter of Teucer, who ruled a region in Asia Minor. After Teucer's death he bec
2 CONC ame ruler of the region, which he named Dardania and which was later called Troas or Troy after Tros, Dardanus's grandson. The chief city of the region was named Troy, and the town of Dardanus, adjoin
2 CONC ing Troy, preserved the name of the ancient king.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Teucer was the son of the river-god Scamander and Idaea, a nymph of Mount Ida. He was the first king of Troad. He had daughter named Bateia that he married to Dardanus.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Greek mythology, Assaracus was the second son of King Tros of Dardania. He inherited the throne when his elder brother Ilus preferred to reign instead over his newly founded city of Ilium (which
2 CONC  also became known as Troy). He married Aigesta (or Themiste or Clytodora), daughter of Laomedon. Assaracus' son and heir was Capys. He was also a brother of Ganymede.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Assaracus</p>
2 CONT <p>He married Adrastus' daughter Eurydice, who bore him Laomedon andThemiste. Migrating from Dardania, of which his brother Assaracus becameking, to Phrygia, he competed in games in which he won a pri
2 CONC ze of 50 menand 50 girls - and a dappled cow, which the local king gave him inobedience to an oracle. Ilus was commanded to found a city where theanimal sat down. This it did upon a hill near Mount Id
2 CONC a, sacred to thegoddess Ate (Infatuation). There he founded the city of Troy (Ilium).When Ilus asked for a sign, Zeus sent him the Palladium, a wooden imageof Athena, which dropped out of the sky in f
2 CONC ront of his tent. At thisspot he founded a temple for Athena. It was believed that as long as thePalladium was kept safe in the temple, Troy could not fall.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the Iliad, Ilus' tomb is mentioned near a wild fig tree in the plainof Troy but it is still uncertain whether it refers to him or his greatnephew.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>----------------</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The kingdom of Dardanus 1 and Erichthonius 1 was divided, because whileIlus 2 became king of Ilium (Troy), his brother Assaracus continued to beking of the Dardanians....In Dardania, Assaracus was 
2 CONC succeeded on thethrone by his son Capys 1, who towards the end of the Trojan War is saidto have recommended throwing the WOODEN HORSE into the sea. Capys 1 isfather of Anchises 1, who is father of Aen
2 CONC eas, leader of the Dardaniansduring the Trojan War. Aeneas is remembered for his courage and piety,and as the one who was destined to survive and to save the House ofDardanus 1 from extinction. For Ae

2 CONT <p>Notes for KING OF DARDANIA TROS:</p>
2 CONT <p>Two Ruling Houses  </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tros succeeded his father Erichthonius to the throne. He gave his name to the land (Troad) and to the people living in the Troad (Trojans). His son, Ganymede was so beautiful, that Zeus in the form
2 CONC  of an eagle, abducted the youth. Ganymede became the cupbearer in Olympus. Zeus gave Tros a couple of immortal horses and vine made of gold, to compensate for abducting the king's son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Dardanians people, was then divided into two separate groups, between his two other sons by Callirrhoë (Callirrhoe): Ilus and Assaracus. Assaracus succeeded his father and continued to rule at
2 CONC  Dardania, while Ilus chose to move closer to the sea. Ilus founded the city that he named Ilium, after himself. Ilium was, however, often called Troy, after his father. The two brothers began to rule
2 CONC  two separate houses.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the Dardanian line, Assaracus' son, Capys, married Themiste, daughter of Ilus and Eurydice. Capys became the father of Anchises. Anchises was a lover of Aphrodite, who bore him a son and hero, A
2 CONC eneas. Zeus struck Anchises with a thunderbolt, when he boasted of having slept with the love-goddess. He became a cripple, unable to walk. His son ruled Dardania in his place. Aeneas was the only lea
2 CONC der, who fought on the Trojan side, to survive the Trojan War.

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} AEGIALE (2) was the mother of Alcyone by Aeolus, according to some, although Alcyone's mother is usually given as Enarete.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>CALYCE was a daughter of Aeolus and Enarete. Her family tree produced some of the greatest heroes and heroines in mythology, since her brothers were Cretheus, Sisyphus, Athamas, Salmoneus, Deion, M
2 CONC agnes, Perieres, and Macareus. She did well in her own right. She married Aethlius, son of Zeus and Protogeneia and grandson of Deucalion. By him she became the mother of the famous Endymion, who was 
2 CONC not only the lover of the moon goddess Selene but also king of Elis and ancestor of the Aetolians, Epeians, and Paeonians. By report, she had 50 half-immortal granddaughters by the union of Selene wit
2 CONC h her sleeping son, but this phenomenon is discussed elsewhere. [Apollodorus 1.7.2,3.5; Pausanias 5.1.2,8.1, 10.31.2.]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>MEROPE was one of the Pleiades. In the constellation of the Pleiades she is the seventh and least visible star because she was ashamed of having had intercourse with a mortal man. This mortal was S
2 CONC isyphus, and Merope should have been ashamed not so much that he was mortal but because of the type of mortal he was. He was the son of Aeolus and Enarete, and brother of Cretheus, Athamas, Salmoneus,
2 CONC  Deion, Magnes, Perieres, and Macareus. He eventually reigned in Corinth, since Medea gave him the sovereignty when she left. He promoted commerce and helped make the city important. He was of bad cha
2 CONC racter however, as Merope was soon to discover. She bore him Glaucus, Ornytion, Thersander, and Halmus. Sisyphus meanwhile had twin sons by his niece Tyro, but she killed them at their birth. Of Merop
2 CONC e's sons we know Glaucus best, not only as the father of Bellerophon but also as the breeder of flesh-eating mares. When Sisyphus was on his deathbed, he begged Merope not to bury him. She complied, a
2 CONC nd when he got to the underworld he complained that he was neglected and needed to return to the upper world to punish his wife. Once there he refused to return, and Hermes, transporter of the dead, h
2 CONC ad to carry him back by force. [Apollodorus 1.9.3,3.10.1; Ovid, Fasti 4.175; Homer, Iliad 6.153; Eustathius on Homer's Iliad 1155; Pausanias 2.4.3, 6.20.9, 9.34.5; Hyginus, Fables 60.]

2 CONT <p>Argos (Greek: Ἄργος, Árgos, IPA: [ˈaɾɣos]) is a city in Greece in the Peloponnese near Nafplio, which was its historic harbor, named for Nauplius.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Name</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The region of Argos is called the Argolis or Argolid. The inhabitants of Argos were called Ἀργεῖοι or Argīvī in Latin, rendered Argives in English.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The name might be of pre-Greek ("Pelasgian") derivation; the name of its acropolis, Larissa certainly is. Aitiology derives it from a mythological founder, Argos son of Zeus and Niobe (see also Dan
2 CONC aus).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] History</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Ancient Argos</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A Neolithic settlement was located near the central sanctuary of Argolis, removed 45 stadia from Argos, closer to Mycenae. The sanctuary was dedicated to "Argivian Hera". The main festival of that 
2 CONC temple were the Hekatombaia, one of the major festivals of Argos itself. Walter Burkert (Homo necans, p. 185) connected the festival to the myth of the slaying of Argus Panoptes by Hermes. There have 
2 CONC been speculations that Hermes' epitheton Argeiphontes, which was understood as "Argus-slayer" very early, is in fact related to the adjective argós "shimmering" or "quick", from a root arg- (PIE *ar
2 CONC -, hence also argyros, silver), with a meaning "shining brightly" or similar, and only secondarily connected with the toponym or mythological Argus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Argos was a major stronghold of Mycenaean times, and along with the neighboring acropoleis of Mycenae and Tiryns became very early settlements because of their commanding positions in the midst of 
2 CONC the fertile plain of Argolis.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Homeric times it belonged to a follower of Agamemnon and gave its name to the surrounding district; the Argolid which the Romans knew as Argeia. The importance of Argos was eclipsed by nearby Sp
2 CONC arta after the 6th century BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Because of its refusal to fight or send supplies in the Greco-Persian Wars, Argos was shunned by most other city-states. Argos remained neutral or the ineffective ally of Athens during the 5th cent
2 CONC ury BC struggles between Sparta and Athens.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mythological kings of Argos include : Inachus, Phoroneus, Argos, Agenor, Triopas, Iasus, Crotopus, Sthenelas, Pelasgus (aka Gelanor), Danaus, Lynceus, Abas, Acrisius, Proteus, Megapénthês, Perseu
2 CONC s, Argeus, and Anaxagoras. An alternative version (supplied by Tatiānus[2]) of the 17 consecutive kings of Argōs, has (between Phorōneus and Triopas) Apis, Argios, Kriasos, Phorbas, and (after Pers
2 CONC eus) Eurustheus, Atreus, Thuestēs, Agamemnōn; skipping Gelanōr and Megapenthēs. The correct form of /Prōteus/ should be /Proitos/.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After this there were three kings ruling Argos at any time, one descended from each of Bias, Melampus, and Anaxagoras. Melampus was succeeded by his son Mantius, then Oicles, and Amphiaraus, and hi
2 CONC s house of Melampus lasted down to the brothers Alcmaeon and Amphilochus, who fought in the Trojan War.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Greek mythology, Bias (Greek: Βίας) was a brother of Melampus who received one third of Argos. Bias married his cousin Pero and had one child, Talaus, with her. When Pero died he remarried I
2 CONC phianassa, daughter of Proetus, after Melampus had cured her from madness. He received one third of Proetus's kingdom. Bias and Iphianassa had a daughter Anaxibia who married Pelias, to whom she bore 
2 CONC Acastus and several daughters. According to Pausanias, Amythaon is the father of Bias and Melampus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Amythaon was the father of Bias and Melampous, who later moved to the court of their uncle Neleus at Pylos, where Bias married Neleus' daughter Pero to become the grandfather of Adrastus, the king 
2 CONC of Argos who led the expedition of the Seven against Thebes at the request of Polynices, Oedipus' son. Melampous was a seer and a healer endowed with magical powers and, after helping his brother Bias

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p>AEOLIA was the daughter of Amythaon, son of Cretheus and Tyro, and sister of Bias and Melampus. Their mother was Eidomene; she was also their first cousin, since Amythaon married his brother's daug
2 CONC hter. Aeolia married Calydon, by whom she became the mother of Epicaste and Protogeneia. Since Calydon was the founder of the town of Calydon, Aeolia can by considered the mother of the Calydonian dyn
2 CONC asty. [Apollodorus 1.7.7.]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>EIDOMENE, or Idomene, was a daughter of Pheres, son of Cretheus and Tyro, and Periclymene. Her brothers were Admetus and Lycurgus, and her sister was Periapis. Pheres founded the town of Pherae in 
2 CONC Thessaly. In one place Eidomene was referred to as the daughter of Abas. She married Amythaon, her uncle, thus becoming not only a cousin but also aunt of Jason, since Amythaon was brother to Aeson, J
2 CONC ason's father. By Amythaon she became the mother of sons Bias and Melampus, and a daughter Aeolia. She was sometimes called Aglaia or Dorippe. Amythaon migrated to Messenia and settled at the court of
2 CONC  Neleus, his half-brother. He started the Olympic games after the sons of Pelops left Elis. He went back to Thessaly to greet Jason when his nephew appeared at the court of Pelias. Bias and Melampus w
2 CONC ent on to become joint rulers in Argos because they were able to cure the insanity of the daughters of Proetus. Melampus was able to accomplish the cure through his combined gift of prophecy and medic
2 CONC al knowledge. Eidomene probably lived with her sons in Argos after Amythaon died and they had acquired their part of the kingdom. [Apollodorus 1.9.11, 2.2.2, 3.10.4, 13.8; Diodorus Siculus 4.68; Homer
2 CONC , Odyssey 11.259; Pausanias 5.8.2; Pindar, Pythian Odes 4.124.]

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} (Recreated mankind after Zeus destroyed those his father created)
2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p>CALYCE was a daughter of Aeolus and Enarete. Her family tree produced some of the greatest heroes and heroines in mythology, since her brothers were Cretheus, Sisyphus, Athamas, Salmoneus, Deion, M
2 CONC agnes, Perieres, and Macareus. She did well in her own right. She married Aethlius, son of Zeus and Protogeneia and grandson of Deucalion. By him she became the mother of the famous Endymion, who was 
2 CONC not only the lover of the moon goddess Selene but also king of Elis and ancestor of the Aetolians, Epeians, and Paeonians. By report, she had 50 half-immortal granddaughters by the union of Selene wit
2 CONC h her sleeping son, but this phenomenon is discussed elsewhere. [Apollodorus 1.7.2,3.5; Pausanias 5.1.2,8.1, 10.31.2.]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>CLYMENE was one of the Oceanides, a daughter of Oceanus and Tethys. By her uncle Iapetus she was the mother of Atlas, Prometheus, Menoetius, and Epimetheus. Iapetus was regarded as the ancestor of 
2 CONC the human race, although it was his son Prometheus who fashioned men out of clay. It is to be expected that there was confusion in the genealogies of the beings involved in setting up the world. Clyme
2 CONC ne was also called the mother by Prometheus of Hellen and Deucalion. This mother/son liason would not be particularly usual in the confusing descent of the gods, but Prometheus' wife was usually calle
2 CONC d Celaeno. Somewhere along the way, probably after the confinement of Iapetus in Tartarus with other Titans, Clymene married Merops, a king of the Ethiopians. Clymene was unfaithful to him and gave he
2 CONC rself to her cousin (and brother-in-law) Helios, the sun. By him she had the Heliades and Phaethon. Clymene's children were pivotal in the contest of the gods against the Titans and in the development
2 CONC  of the human race. Atlas and Menoetius were both punished for their roles in the conflict with the Olympians. Atlas was condemned to bear the heavens on his head and shoulders, but not before he beca
2 CONC me father of the Pleiades, the Hyades, the Hesperides, and other beings. Menoetius was struck by Zeus with a thunderbolt and thrown into Tartarus. Prometheus and Epimetheus were the parents of Deucali
2 CONC on and Pyrrha, respectively, and these offspring were responsible for repopulating the earth after the great flood. For going contrary to the will of Zeus in regard to the human race, Prometheus was p
2 CONC unished atop Mount Caucasus by having his liver pecked out daily by an eagle and having it restored each successive day. Pandora, the wife of Epimetheus, let loose all the troubles of the world by ope
2 CONC ning a forbidden chest. Phaethon, the son of Clymene and Helios, almost caused the destruction of the world. He begged his father to let him drive the chariot of the sun across heaven. He proved too w
2 CONC eak to handle the dazzling horses, and the chariot fell toward the earth. Zeus struck him from the chariot, and he plummeted to earth. Helios recovered the reins in time to keep the earth from burning
2 CONC  to a cinder. Phaethon's mother was also called Merope, Prote, or Rhode. [Hesiod, Theogony 351,507; Hyginus, Fables 156; Apollodorus 1.2.3; Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.763, Tristia 3.4.30.]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>PANDORA over the centuries has become a kind of equivalent of Eve, the first created woman. Much blame was assigned to both because of a foolish mistake (provided we remove the element of destiny).
2 CONC  Pandora, whose name literally meant All Gifts, came into being when Zeus had her created by the master artisan Hephaestus to punish Prometheus for stealing fire from heaven. Right there we have an an
2 CONC omaly, since the theft of fire presupposed an already existing population of the earth. But perhaps only males existed at that point, and Zeus had other ideas for propagation. It is interesting that h
2 CONC e saw the creation of a woman as a punishment. Whatever the reason, Pandora was created as the first woman, and all the gods came forward to endow her with gifts. Aphrodite gave her beauty, Hermes gav
2 CONC e her cunning, and other gods and goddesses gave her various powers that Zeus had calculated to bring about the ruin of man. Finally he had Hermes deliver her to Epimetheus, the not-so-bright brother 
2 CONC of Prometheus. Epimetheus was utterly charmed by this marvelous creation, although he had been warned by Prometheus never to accept a gift from Zeus. He forgot his promise to his brother to think befo
2 CONC re acting, because Aphrodite's gift had certainly included the ability of Pandora to give her husband ultimate sexual pleasure. Life was happy for Pandora and especially so for Epimetheus. But already
2 CONC  destiny was at work. In the house was a covered earthen vessel (or box or chest) that either had been placed in the safekeeping of Epimetheus or given to Pandora along with other gifts. In either cas
2 CONC e it was forbidden to open it. But its unknown contents plagued Pandora (she had been given curiosity along with everything else). One day while Epimetheus was away, she could stand the temptation no 
2 CONC longer and peeked into the vessel. She found out soon enough why she should not have opened the pot, for out swarmed all the calamities of mankind--from tidal waves to premature balding. It was too la
2 CONC te to stop them as they spread out through the window and across the world. Pandora dropped the lid back in time to prevent the excape of the final occupant of the vessel. This was Elpis, and no matte
2 CONC r how bad things became for people then and in the future, there was always hope. Pandora became the mother of Pyrrha by Epimetheus. Pyrrha married Deucalion, son of Prometheus, and these two people r
2 CONC epopulated the earth when Zeus, finally disgusted with man, sent a flood to wipe out the human race. There is no record of Pandora's final history. It is not really certain whether or not she was cons
2 CONC idered immortal. In later writings she became associated with infernal divinities such as Hecate, Persephone, and the Erinyes. In one or two versions of the allegory, Pandora brought the fatal vessel 
2 CONC Epimetheus and, using her newly fashioned wiles, prevaied upon him to open it. It is interesting to observe the parallel of this story to that of Eve in the garden of Eden urging Adam to taste the for
2 CONC bidden apple. Some said the vessel contained only benefits for mankind, but these were allowed to escape. In any case, the result was intended to be the same. The birth of Pandora was represented on t
2 CONC he pedestal of the statue of Athena in the Parthenon. [Hesiod, Theogony 571, Works and Days 30,50,96; Hyginus, Fables 142; Apollodorus 1.7.2; Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.350; Orphica, Argonautica 974.]

2 CONT <p>This article is about Adrastus, son of Talaus, king of Argos. For others with this name, see Adrastus (disambiguation).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Adrastus (Greek: Ἄδραστος, Adrastos) or Adrestus (Ionic Greek: Ἄδρηστος, Adrēstos), traditionally translated as "nonparticipant" or "uncooperative",[1] was a legendary king of Ar
2 CONC gos during the war of the Seven Against Thebes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Mythological tradition</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He was a son of Talaus and Lysimache.[2] Pausanias calls his mother Lysianassa,[3] and Hyginus calls her Eurynome.[4][5] He was one of the three kings at Argos, along with Iphis and Amphiaraus, who
2 CONC  was married to Adrastus's sister Eriphyle. He was married to either Amphithea, daughter of Pronax, or to Demonassa. His daughters Argea and Deipyle married Polynices and Tydeus, respectively. His oth
2 CONC er children include Aegialia, Aegialeus, and Cyanippus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During a feud between the most powerful houses in Argos, Talaus was slain by Amphiaraus, and Adrastus being expelled from his dominions fled to Polybus, then king of Sicyon. When Polybus died with
2 CONC out heirs, Adrastus succeeded him on the throne of Sicyon, and during his reign he is said to have instituted the Nemean Games.[6][7][8][3]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to "Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Greece" by Edward E. Barthell, he states that Adrastus is the son of Talaus and Lysimache (daughter of Abas). He married Amphitheia, daughter of his brot
2 CONC her Pronax, and became the father of a son, Aegialeus, and four daughters: Aegialeia, who became the wife of Diomedes (son of Tydeus); Argeia, who became the wife of Polyneices (son of Oedipus); Deipy
2 CONC le, who became the wife of Tydeus (son of Oeneus); and Eurydice, who became the wife of the Trojan king, Ilus (son of Tros).[9]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit] Seven against Thebes</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Afterwards, however, Adrastus became reconciled to Amphiaraus, gave him his sister Eriphyle in marriage, and returned to his kingdom of Argos upon the swift immortal horse Arion, a gift of Heracles
2 CONC . During the time he reigned there it hap­pened that Tydeus of Calydon and Polynices of Thebes, both fugitives from their native countries, met at Argos near the palace of Adrastus, and came to words
2 CONC  and from words to blows.[10] On hearing the noise, Adrastus hastened to them and separated the combatants, in whom he immediately recognised the two men that had been promised to him by an oracle as 
2 CONC the future husbands of two of his daughters; for one bore on his shield the figure of a boar, and the other that of a lion, and the oracle was that one of his daughters was to marry a boar and the oth
2 CONC er a lion. Adras­tus therefore gave his daughter Deipyle to Tydeus, and Argeia to Polynices, and at the same time promised to lead each of these princes back to his own country. Adrastus now prepared
2 CONC  for war against Thebes, although Amphiaraus foretold that all who should engage in it should perish, with the exception of Adrastus.[11][12]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Thus arose the celebrated war of the Seven against Thebes, in which Adrastus was joined by six other heroes, Polynices, Tydeus, Amphiaraus, Capaneus, Hippomedon, and Parthenopaeus. Instead of Tydeu
2 CONC s and Polynices other legends mention Eteoclos and Mecisteus. This war ended as unfortunately as Amphiaraus had predicted, and Adrastus alone was saved by the swiftness of his horse Arion.[13][14][15]

2 CONT <p>After the battle, Creon, king of Thebes, ordered that none of the fallen enemies were to be given funeral rites. Against his order, Antigone buried Polynices and was put to death, but Adrastus esca
2 CONC ped to Athens to petition Theseus, the city's king, to attack Thebes and force the return of the bodies of the remaining five. Theseus initially refused but was convinced by his mother, Aethra, who ha
2 CONC d been beseeched by the mothers of the fallen, to put the matter to a vote of the citizens. The Athenians marched on Thebes and conquered the city but inflicted no additional damage, taking only what 
2 CONC they came for, the five bodies. They were laid upon a funeral pyre and Adrastus eulogized each.[16][17]

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ten years after this Adrastus persuaded the seven sons of the heroes who had fallen in the war against Thebes to make a new attack upon that city, and Amphiaraus now declared that the gods approved
2 CONC  of the undertaking, and promised success.[18][19] This war is celebrated in ancient story as the War of the Epigoni. Thebes was taken and razed to the ground, after the greater part of its inhabitant
2 CONC s had left the city on the advice of Tiresias.[20][21][22] The only Argive hero that fell in this war was Aegialeus, the son of Adras­tus. After having built a temple of Nemesis in the neighborhood o
2 CONC f Thebes, he set out on his return home. But weighed down by old age and grief at the death of his son he died at Megara and was buried there.[23] After his death he was worshipped in several parts of
2 CONC  Greece, as at Megara,[24] at Sicyon where his memory was celebrated in tragic cho­ruses,[8] and in Attica.[25]

2 CONT <p>The legends about Adrastus and the two wars against Thebes have furnished ample materials for the epic as well as tragic poets of Greece,[26] and some works of art relating to the stories about Adr

2 CONT <p>Adrastus (Greek: Ἄδρηστος) was the son of Gordias, king of Phrygia. He features prominently in Herodotus's story of King Croesus of Lydia. He killed his brother, unwittingly,[1] and was dr
2 CONC iven out by his father. In Sardis, he obtained purification (katharsis) from Croesus, and was accepted as a guest in the palace.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During this time, a great boar came down from the Mysian Mount Olympus (a different mountain from the legendary home of the gods), which ravaged the lands of the Mysians; when they came out against
2 CONC  it, they could inflict no harm upon it, but they suffered greatly in return. The Mysians sent messengers to the house of Croesus asking the king to send his son Atys with a party of men and dogs to a
2 CONC id them. Croesus initially refused to send his son, having had a dream warning of Atys's young death upon an iron spearpoint, but Atys succeeded in convincing him to let him go, making the point that 
2 CONC no boar could wield an iron spear.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Croesus came to Adrastus then to ask him for a favour, asking that he guard and protect his son on the hunt, and Adrastus accepted and accompanied Atys there. Upon finding the boar, the party surro
2 CONC unded it in a circle and hurled spears at it; however, Adrastus missed his target and struck Atys a mortal blow. When the group came back bearing Atys's body, Adrastus held his hands out to King Croes
2 CONC us in supplication - he begged that he himself be ritually slaughtered over the prince's body, saying that he could no longer go on living with the blood-guilt of yet another person on his hands. Croe
2 CONC sus refused him this, saying this was vengeance from the gods, not Adrastus's personal fault; nevertheless, Adrastus took his own life.

2 CONT <p>Adrastus (Greek: Ἄδραστος, Adrastos) or Adrestus (Ionic Greek: Ἄδρηστος, Adrēstos), traditionally translated as "nonparticipant" or "uncooperative", was a legendary king of Argos
2 CONC  during the war of the Seven Against Thebes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mythological tradition</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He was a son of Talaus and Lysimache. Pausanias calls his mother Lysianassa, and Hyginus calls her Eurynome. He was one of the three kings at Argos, along with Iphis and Amphiaraus, who was married
2 CONC  to Adrastus's sister Eriphyle. He was married to either Amphithea, daughter of Pronax, or to Demonassa. His daughters Argea and Deipyle married Polynices and Tydeus, respectively. His other children 
2 CONC include Aegiale, Aegialeus, and Cyanippus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During a feud between the most powerful houses in Argos, Talaus was slain by Amphiaraus, and Adrastus being expelled from his dominions fled to Polybus, then king of Sicyon. When Polybus died with
2 CONC out heirs, Adrastus succeeded him on the throne of Sicyon, and during his reign he is said to have instituted the Nemean Games.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to "Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Greece" by Edward E. Barthell, he states that Adrastus is the son of Talaus and Lysimache (daughter of Abas). He married Amphitheia, daughter of his brot
2 CONC her Pronax, and became the father of a son, Aegialeus, and four daughters: Aegialeia, who became the wife of Diomedes (son of Tydeus); Argeia, who became the wife of Polyneices (son of Oedipus); Deipy
2 CONC le, who became the wife of Tydeus (son of Oeneus); and Eurydice, who became the wife of the Trojan king, Ilus (son of Tros).

2 CONT <p>Laomedon  </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the Trojan line, Ilus who was the founder and king of Troy, married Eurydice, and became the father of Laomedon. As it was said before, his daughter Themiste married his nephew, Capys (of the Da
2 CONC rdanian line). His son Laomedon succeeded Ilus. Of the two royal lines, those of Troy became more powerful than the older Dardanian line, under the rule of Laomedon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The new king married Strymo, Placia or Leucippe. Whichever woman he married, he was the father of Podarces (Priam) and many other sons. He had at least one daughter, Hesione. His son Tithonus was a
2 CONC bducted by Eos, goddess of dawn, and taken to Ethiopia, Syria. The goddess bore him a son Memnon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laomedon was known as the king, for his arrogance and impiety and who refused to honors his promises. Poseidon and Apollo, possibly punished for rebelling against Zeus, had to work for one year for
2 CONC  a mortal. The two gods disguised as builders, was hired to work alongside with a mortal, Aeacus, son of Zeus and Aegina, (father of Peleus and Telamon), to build the walls of Troy. Poseidon and Apoll
2 CONC o wanted the vine of gold as payment for their work. Laomedon agreed. After the gods finished building the wall, Laomedon refused to pay their wages for their services. Apollo caused the plague within
2 CONC  the city, while Poseidon send a sea-monster to ravage the Trojan countryside.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The seers told Laomedon, that land would be spare, if the king sacrifice his daughter to the sea-monster. Chaining his daughter, Hesione and waited for monster to arrive. Heracles, who was performi

2 CONC greed. After killing the monster, again Laomedon refused to pay. Heracles angry at the Trojan king betrayal on his promise, planned to return with an army, after he finish performing the twelve labour
2 CONC s.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Heracles raised an army in Tiryns, and the Argonaut hero, Telamon of Salamis, son of Aeacus. After capturing the city, Laomedon was killed, along with many of his sons, and Heracles gave Heisone to
2 CONC  Telamon as concubine. She allowed Hesione to ransomed one captive. Hesione ransomed her youngest brother Podarces, with her veil. Podarces became king of Troy, and changed his name to Priam (Ransom).

2 CONT <p>Aeneas Bearing Anchises from Troy, by Carle van Loo, 1729 (Louvre).In Greek mythology, Anchises was a son of Capys and Themiste (daughter of Ilus, son of Tros) or Hieromneme, a naiad. His major cla
2 CONC im to fame in Greek mythology is that he was a mortal lover of the goddess Aphrodite. One version is that Aphrodite pretended to be a Phrygian princess and seduced him for nearly two weeks of lovemaki
2 CONC ng. Anchises learned that his lover was a goddess only nine months later, when she revealed herself and presented him with the infant Aeneas.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anchises was a prince from Dardania, a territory neighbouring Troy. He had a mortal wife named Eriopis, according to the scholiasts, and he is credited with other children beside Aeneas. Homer, in 
2 CONC the Iliad, mentions a daughter named Hippodameia, their eldest ("the darling of her father and mother"), who married her cousin Alcathous.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anchises bred his mares with the divine stallions owned by King Laomedon. However, he made the mistake of bragging about his liaison with Aphrodite, and as a result Zeus, the king of the gods, hit 
2 CONC him with a thunderbolt which left him lame.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the defeat of Troy in the Trojan War, the elderly Anchises was carried from the burning city by his son Aeneas, accompanied by Aeneas' wife Creusa, who died in the escape attempt, and small s
2 CONC on Ascanius (the subject is depicted in several paintings, including a famous version by Federico Barocci in the Galleria Borghese in Rome). Anchises himself died and was buried in Sicily many years l
2 CONC ater. Aeneas later visited Hades and saw his father again in the Elysian Fields. Homer's Iliad mentions another Anchises, a wealthy native of Sicyon in Greece and father of Echepolus.

2 CONT <p>Anchises , in Greek mythology, member of the ruling family of Troy; father of Aeneas by Aphrodite. When Anchises boasted of the goddess's love, Zeus crippled or, in some versions of the legend, bli

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anchises 1, who had the privilege of being loved by a goddess, came from Dardania, which is a territory neighbouring Troy named after Dardanus 1, who once colonized it after leaving the island of S

2 CONT <p>When Zeus , by reason of Ganymedes ' beauty, took him to heaven, he gave Tros 1 recompense for his son in the form of some extraordinary horses, which are otherwise known as the MARES OF LAOMEDON 1

2 CONC  1 knew nothing of it, but from these a stock of six was born in Anchises 1's palace. Of these horses he kept four for himself giving the other two to his son Aeneas to fight in the war at Troy . But

2 CONT <p>Yet the greatest moment in Anchises 1's life must have been his meeting with Aphrodite , when he was tending cattle on Mount Ida. When the goddess saw him, she was seized by desire, and went immedi

2 CONT <p>Anchises or Ankises is mentioned in Lukian's "The Sentence of Paris" asAeneas' father.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anchises was King of Dardania. One day Aphrodite (Roman name Venus) cameto him while he was looking after his sheep on Mount Ida. Prior to hervisit she had angered Zeus and in his anger he made her
2 CONC  fall in love withthe mortal Anchises. She appeared before him as a mortal girl and fromthere union Aeneas was born. On discovering she was a goddess Anchisesfeared great punishment, a common occuranc

2 CONT <p>When five years old Aphrodite removed Aeneas and returned him to hisfather. Years later, in a state of drunkenness, Anchises boasted that hehad been the the lover of Aphrodite and for this Zeus lam

2 CONT <p>Two Ruling Houses  </p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tros succeeded his father Erichthonius to the throne. He gave his name to the land (Troad) and to the people living in the Troad (Trojans). His son, Ganymede was so beautiful, that Zeus in the form
2 CONC  of an eagle, abducted the youth. Ganymede became the cupbearer in Olympus. Zeus gave Tros a couple of immortal horses and vine made of gold, to compensate for abducting the king's son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Dardanians people, was then divided into two separate groups, between his two other sons by Callirrhoë (Callirrhoe): Ilus and Assaracus. Assaracus succeeded his father and continued to rule at
2 CONC  Dardania, while Ilus chose to move closer to the sea. Ilus founded the city that he named Ilium, after himself. Ilium was, however, often called Troy, after his father. The two brothers began to rule
2 CONC  two separate houses.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the Dardanian line, Assaracus' son, Capys, married Themiste, daughter of Ilus and Eurydice. Capys became the father of Anchises. Anchises was a lover of Aphrodite, who bore him a son and hero, A
2 CONC eneas. Zeus struck Anchises with a thunderbolt, when he boasted of having slept with the love-goddess. He became a cripple, unable to walk. His son ruled Dardania in his place. Aeneas was the only lea

2 CONT <p>Mother: Chrysopeleia or Laodameia or Erato or Meganeira</p>
2 CONT <p> ........... MAIA was the eldest of the Pleiades. As daughter of Atlas and Pleione, she was sometimes called either Atlantis or Pleias. One account called her a daughter of Atlas and Sterope, his o
2 CONC wn daughter. She was visited in a cave on Mount Cyllene in Arcadia by Zeus and became the mother of Hermes, one of the Olympian gods. He was surnamed Cyllenius from his birthplace. That is the extent 
2 CONC of what we know of Maia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Zeus had his affair with Callisto and she was changed into a bear, the baby, Arcas, was carried to Maia to be brought up. In a manner of speaking, he was her stepson, but so were scores of ot
2 CONC her sons of Zeus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Maia is famous through her son, for her presence is felt in the nursery adventures of the god of thieves. Hermes escaped from his cradle and went to Pieria, carrying off some of Apollo's oxen, but 
2 CONC was forgiven when he invented the lyre from a tortoise shell. He became the messenger of the other gods, and was notorious for his ingenuity and cunning. We lose sight of Maia after Hermes became adul
2 CONC t. She was not even mentioned in the upbringing of Dionysus, in which Hermes took a part. The Romans had a divinity called Maia, or Majesta, who was sometimes considered the wife of Vulcan, largely be
2 CONC cause a priest of Vulcan offered a sacrifice to her on May 1. Later, she became identified with the Greek Maia and was called the mother of Mercury. [Homeric Hymn to Hermes 3,17; Hesiod, Theogony 938;

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} In Greek mythology, Cretheus, or Krētheus (Κρηθεύς) was the king and founder of Iolcus, the son of Aeolus (son of Hellen) and Enarete. His wives were Sidero, Tyro and either De
2 CONC modice or Biadice. His parents were Aeolus and Enarete. With Tyro, he fathered Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon.
2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p>AEOLIA was the daughter of Amythaon, son of Cretheus and Tyro, and sister of Bias and Melampus. Their mother was Eidomene; she was also their first cousin, since Amythaon married his brother's daug
2 CONC hter. Aeolia married Calydon, by whom she became the mother of Epicaste and Protogeneia. Since Calydon was the founder of the town of Calydon, Aeolia can by considered the mother of the Calydonian dyn
2 CONC asty. [Apollodorus 1.7.7.]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>CALYCE was a daughter of Aeolus and Enarete. Her family tree produced some of the greatest heroes and heroines in mythology, since her brothers were Cretheus, Sisyphus, Athamas, Salmoneus, Deion, M
2 CONC agnes, Perieres, and Macareus. She did well in her own right. She married Aethlius, son of Zeus and Protogeneia and grandson of Deucalion. By him she became the mother of the famous Endymion, who was 
2 CONC not only the lover of the moon goddess Selene but also king of Elis and ancestor of the Aetolians, Epeians, and Paeonians. By report, she had 50 half-immortal granddaughters by the union of Selene wit
2 CONC h her sleeping son, but this phenomenon is discussed elsewhere. [Apollodorus 1.7.2,3.5; Pausanias 5.1.2,8.1, 10.31.2.]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>EIDOMENE, or Idomene, was a daughter of Pheres, son of Cretheus and Tyro, and Periclymene. Her brothers were Admetus and Lycurgus, and her sister was Periapis. Pheres founded the town of Pherae in 
2 CONC Thessaly. In one place Eidomene was referred to as the daughter of Abas. She married Amythaon, her uncle, thus becoming not only a cousin but also aunt of Jason, since Amythaon was brother to Aeson, J
2 CONC ason's father. By Amythaon she became the mother of sons Bias and Melampus, and a daughter Aeolia. She was sometimes called Aglaia or Dorippe. Amythaon migrated to Messenia and settled at the court of
2 CONC  Neleus, his half-brother. He started the Olympic games after the sons of Pelops left Elis. He went back to Thessaly to greet Jason when his nephew appeared at the court of Pelias. Bias and Melampus w
2 CONC ent on to become joint rulers in Argos because they were able to cure the insanity of the daughters of Proetus. Melampus was able to accomplish the cure through his combined gift of prophecy and medic
2 CONC al knowledge. Eidomene probably lived with her sons in Argos after Amythaon died and they had acquired their part of the kingdom. [Apollodorus 1.9.11, 2.2.2, 3.10.4, 13.8; Diodorus Siculus 4.68; Homer
2 CONC , Odyssey 11.259; Pausanias 5.8.2; Pindar, Pythian Odes 4.124.]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>MEROPE was one of the Pleiades. In the constellation of the Pleiades she is the seventh and least visible star because she was ashamed of having had intercourse with a mortal man. This mortal was S
2 CONC isyphus, and Merope should have been ashamed not so much that he was mortal but because of the type of mortal he was. He was the son of Aeolus and Enarete, and brother of Cretheus, Athamas, Salmoneus,
2 CONC  Deion, Magnes, Perieres, and Macareus. He eventually reigned in Corinth, since Medea gave him the sovereignty when she left. He promoted commerce and helped make the city important. He was of bad cha
2 CONC racter however, as Merope was soon to discover. She bore him Glaucus, Ornytion, Thersander, and Halmus. Sisyphus meanwhile had twin sons by his niece Tyro, but she killed them at their birth. Of Merop
2 CONC e's sons we know Glaucus best, not only as the father of Bellerophon but also as the breeder of flesh-eating mares. When Sisyphus was on his deathbed, he begged Merope not to bury him. She complied, a
2 CONC nd when he got to the underworld he complained that he was neglected and needed to return to the upper world to punish his wife. Once there he refused to return, and Hermes, transporter of the dead, h
2 CONC ad to carry him back by force. [Apollodorus 1.9.3,3.10.1; Ovid, Fasti 4.175; Homer, Iliad 6.153; Eustathius on Homer's Iliad 1155; Pausanias 2.4.3, 6.20.9, 9.34.5; Hyginus, Fables 60.]

2 CONT <p>NELEUS NHLEUS</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A son of Cretheus and Tyro, the daughter of Salmoneus. Tyro, previous to her marriage with Neleus, is said to have loved the river-god Enipeus; and in the form of Enipeus Poseidon once appeared to 
2 CONC her, and became by her the father of Pelias and Neleus (Hom. Od. xi. 234, &c.). Tyro exposed the two boys, but they were found and reared by horse herds, and when thee had grown up they learned who th
2 CONC eir mother was, and Pelias killed their fostermother, who had ill-used Tyro (Apollod. i. 9. § 8). After the death of Cretheus, the two brothers quarrelled about the succession to the throne of Iolcus
2 CONC . Neleus, who was expelled, went with Melampus and Bias to Pylos, which his uncle Aphareus gave to him (Apollod. i. 9. § 9; Diod. iv. 68). Neleus thus became king of Pylos, which town he found in exi
2 CONC stence when he arrived there; but some state that he himself built Pylos, or at least that he erected the royal palace there (Paus. iv. 2. § 3, 36. § 1). It should be observed that several towns of 
2 CONC the name of Pylos claimed the honour of being the city of Neleus or of his son Nestor, such as Pylos in Messenia, Pylos in Elis, and Pylos in Triphylia; the last of which is probably the one mentioned
2 CONC  by Homer in connection with Neleus and Nestor (Strab. viii. p. 337). Neleus was married to Chloris, who, according to Homer (Od. xi. 280, &c.), was a daughter of Amphion of Orchomenos, and according 
2 CONC to others (Diod. l. c.) a Theban woman, and by her he became the father of Nestor, Chromius, Periclymenus, and Pero, though the total number of his sons was twelve (Od. xi. 285, Il. xi. 692; Apollod. 
2 CONC i. 9. § 9; Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. i. 156).

2 CONT <p>A Mycenaean palace, built in the 14th century B.C. atop the hill of Epano Englianos. Its ruins are located near the modern Greek city of Pylos. The palace is believed to have been the home of Nesto

2 CONT <p>Greek legend tells of Neleus, an ancient king, who ruled the area of Pylos with his twelve sons, around 1300 B.C. Some undocumented disaster, probably an earthquake, destroyed their settlement. Nel
2 CONC eus and his son Nestor were among the only survivors, and he and his father built their palace over the ruins.

2 CONT <p>Neleus ( Greek : Νηλέας , Νηλεὺς ) was the son of Poseidon and Tyro, brother of Pelias.

2 CONT <p>Tyro was married to Cretheus (with whom she had one son, Aeson) but loved Enipeus, a river god. She pursued Enipeus, who refused her advances. One day, Poseidon, filled with lust for Tyro, disguise

2 CONT <p>Neleus and Pelias fought for the crown, and Neleus was banished to Messenia, becoming King of Pylos. Heracles later asked Neleus to cleanse him of a blood-debt and was refused. Heracles killed Nele
2 CONC us' sons, including Alastor but excluding Nestor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Greek mythology, Nestor (Νέστωρ, Νέστωρ ) of Gerênia was the son of Neleus, the King of Pylos, and Chloris. He became king after Heracles killed Neleus and all of Nestor's brothers

2 CONT <p>EIDOMENE, or Idomene, was a daughter of Pheres, son of Cretheus and Tyro, and Periclymene. Her brothers were Admetus and Lycurgus, and her sister was Periapis. Pheres founded the town of Pherae in 
2 CONC Thessaly. In one place Eidomene was referred to as the daughter of Abas. She married Amythaon, her uncle, thus becoming not only a cousin but also aunt of Jason, since Amythaon was brother to Aeson, J
2 CONC ason's father. By Amythaon she became the mother of sons Bias and Melampus, and a daughter Aeolia. She was sometimes called Aglaia or Dorippe. Amythaon migrated to Messenia and settled at the court of
2 CONC  Neleus, his half-brother. He started the Olympic games after the sons of Pelops left Elis. He went back to Thessaly to greet Jason when his nephew appeared at the court of Pelias. Bias and Melampus w
2 CONC ent on to become joint rulers in Argos because they were able to cure the insanity of the daughters of Proetus. Melampus was able to accomplish the cure through his combined gift of prophecy and medic
