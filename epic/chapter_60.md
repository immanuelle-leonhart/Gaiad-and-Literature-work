In the wake of destruction's might
There came hope's eternal light—
Though dark age fell upon the land
Hope still lived by faithful hand.

Romer's gap was on the world
With death's dark banner unfurled,
Yet life thrived in hidden ways
Through the long and bitter days.

The daughter in the line
Of Silvio, so fine,
Was Rhea in her day—
She showed the faithful way.

Carbonifer bore her two
Sons, both noble, tried and true:
Romulus and Remus strong
Who would live their whole life long.

These sons would define the age
Upon history's great stage,
So we call this era's name
Carboniferous of fame.

Romulus and Remus fought
About where they ought
To found their nations grand
Throughout the fertile land.

Romulus said with pride:
"On Palatine Hill's side
Rising from the water's flow
Of Mississippi, we shall grow."

But Remus chose instead
Small Aventine's bed
Below the river's might—
A different kind of sight.

Romulus gouged out both eyes
Of Remus beneath the skies
And said with anger's flame:
"If you will not acclaim

The stars in heaven's dome
And will not make your home
Where light can find its way,
You need not see the day."

And so Remus lived his life
In darkness and in strife
Under Aventine Hill
According to his will.

To this day the sons
Of Remus, faithful ones,
Live only underground
Where salty water's found

In aquifers so deep
Where secrets always keep
Their vigil through the years
Despite all joys and fears.

Romulus climbed out
Upon the land about
Like brothers who had come
Before to make their home

With pierced spiracles bright
Upon his sides to fight
The air, and six legs strong
To carry him along.

But Romulus was torn
Apart one bitter morn,
And so his son took hold
Of what his father sold

His life to build with care:
A kingdom in the air
Above the waters deep
Where faithful vigil keep.

Hexapus, his son,
When work was done
Bore two sons to his name:
Vernus and Proturus' fame.

Proturus became
Ancestor of the name
Of Coneheads, and his house
Still honors sacred vows.

With cone-shaped head held high
Beneath the starry sky,
Proturus became father
Of those who'd rather

Live in structured way
From night into the day
With order as their guide
And wisdom by their side.

Vernus became the sire
Of sons whose desire
Was Tails and Collembo—
Two sons who'd always show

Their father's loving way
Throughout each passing day
In all they'd choose to do
With hearts both brave and true.

Collembo became then
Ancestor of the men
Who spring like flying hope
Beyond their earthly scope:

The Springtails, who can bound
High above the ground
With power in their tail
That helps them never fail

To leap beyond the small
And heed the greater call
Of possibility
Through all eternity.

And Tails had many tails
That never, ever fails
To bring him love from all
Who answered duty's call.

With tails beyond compare
That danced upon the air
Like ribbons in the wind
That beauty has rescinded

From ordinary sight
To fill the world with light
Of wonder and of joy
That nothing can destroy.

Tails bore two sons with might:
Dipluron's sight
And Ectognus the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Dipluron became father
Of those who'd rather
Have two prongs like a fork
To help them in their work

Of sweeping through the air
With bristles everywhere
Like brushes that can clean
The finest things unseen.

The two-pronged Bristletails
Tell many wondrous tales
Of how they sweep away
The dust of yesterday

And make the world more bright
For those who seek the light
Of cleanliness and grace
In every dwelling place.

Ectognus begat two
Sons, noble, tried and true:
Archegnos and Zerygos,
Each following different goals.

Archegnos became then
Ancestor of the men
Who jump with bristles bright:
The Jumping Bristletails' sight

That helps them bound on high
Beneath the starry sky
With bristles that can sweep
The air where eagles keep

Their watch above the ground
Where treasures can be found
By those who dare to leap
Beyond what others keep

As limits on their dreams
Of what reality seems
To offer those who try
To reach beyond the sky.

Zerygos begat two more:
Zygentos to explore
And Pterygos, whose sight
Would fill the world with light.

Pterygos lived below
The water's gentle flow
And there he built with care
Gills to process air.

His gills filled up his throat
With air, like precious note
Of music from above
Sung by the ones we love.

Pterygos begat then
Isopter among men
Who had twenty gills bright
To fill his world with sight.

But Barameda came
To challenge Isopter's name
And chased him from his home
Across the water's foam.

So Isopter climbed high
Up toward the starry sky
Upon a tree so tall
That answered duty's call.

And soon he needed air
From atmosphere so fair,
So jumped with faith so true—
His gills would see him through.

His gills became his wings
That hope eternal brings
And glided him down slow
To waters far below.

Isopter begat then
Dezotopter among men
Who had eighteen gills bright
To guide him in his flight.

He took his son up high
Beneath the starry sky
And pushed him from the tree
To see what he could be.

Dezotopter flew down
More graceful than a crown
Of feathers on the wind—
More elegant and refined

Than his father's glide
With beauty as his guide
That lifted up his heart
And played the artist's part.

Each generation learned
To fly, and always yearned
To glide more gracefully
Throughout eternity.

Dezotopter begat bright
Seizapter's sight—
With sixteen gills to bear
His weight upon the air.

Seizapter begat then
Quatorzapter among men
With fourteen gills so fine
That danced in perfect line.

Quatorzapter begat
Duzapter where he sat
With twelve gills bright and true
To see the journey through.

Duzapter begat then
Decapter among men
With ten gills to his name
To play the flying game.

Decapter begat bright
Octapter's sight
With eight gills strong and true
To carry him right through.

Octapter begat then
Hexapter among men
With six gills, and his might
Was greater than the sight

Of all who came before
From mountain peak to shore—
For when he came of age
He turned a new page

In evolution's book
For those who dare to look
At what can be achieved
When dreams are truly believed.

In adulthood he found
A way to leave the ground:
He opened up once more
His spiracles of yore

To breathe the air above
While keeping gills he'd love
And with muscles he made
His wings a flying trade.

He flapped them with his might
And rose into the light
Of sky where eagles soar—
He could fly from the floor

Without a tree to climb
For the very first time
In all of history's page
Of evolution's age.

Hexapter begat then
Insectus among men
Who lived life first below
The water's gentle flow.

And when he came of age
He turned the final page
Of life beneath the sea
To soar through air, so free.

He spread his wings and flew
Through skies of endless blue
And became father bright
Of insects' wondrous sight.

Insectus begat two
Sons, noble, tried and true:
Ephemeros the quick
And Draco's flying trick.

Ephemeros was father
Who'd rather
Have million children dear
In just a single year—

In fact, a single day
He'd live and pass away
After his children came
To carry on his name.

Without a father's care
His children everywhere
Did just the same as he
Through all eternity.

The sons of Ephemeros
Live lives quite glorious
But brief—the Mayflies all
Hold prom each May's call.

In giant celebration
Across each faithful nation
They dance and fall in love
Beneath the stars above

And then they all conceive
Their children, and they leave
This world in just one day
After they've had their say

In love's eternal dance
Of romance
That fills their hearts with joy
That nothing can destroy.

It works for them quite well
As any one can tell
Who watches their brief flight
Through one spring day and night.

But if you are a man
You'd better have a plan
That lasts much longer than
A mayfly's lifespan.

Don't follow their example
Of love so short and ample—
Find love that lasts life long
Like wisdom's ancient song.

Draco lived his life
Without the hurried strife
Of Ephemeros' ways—
He counted all his days

With patience as his guide
And wisdom by his side.
He shortened his long tails
So that he never fails

To fly with graceful art
That touches every heart
That sees his beauty bright
In morning's golden light.

Draco bore two sons
And raised them, faithful ones,
In Rhine's sweet water clear:
Neopter, bright and dear,

And Odonatos strong
Who lived his whole life long
With different aims in sight
From morning until night.

Neopter folded wings
That hope eternal brings
And walked upon the land
Built by the faithful hand

Of those who came before
To open up the door
Of possibility
For all humanity.

He flew when he had need
And ate plants for his feed—
A gentle way to live
With all he had to give

Of peace and harmony
Throughout eternity
For all who shared his world
Where hope's flag was unfurled.

But Odonatos had
Wings broad and never sad
To be without the power
To hunt through every hour.

He couldn't walk for long—
His legs, though they were strong,
Were solely made for hunt
And not for peaceful jaunt

Across the peaceful ground
Where gentle folk are found
Who seek to live in peace
Where conflicts always cease.

He flew everywhere
Through the morning air
And ate his own brothers:
Sons of others

Who shared his family tree
But lived more peacefully
Than his predator's heart
Could understand or part

With in his need to feed
On others' flesh indeed
To satisfy his hunger
That made him wonder

If there might be a way
To live from day to day
Without the need to kill
His kin to have his fill.

The sons of Odonatos
Live lives quite glorious
As warriors of the sky—
They never question why

They must hunt to survive
And stay alive and true
Through cycles of the hunt
That seem quite blunt

To those who'd rather find
A gentler, kinder mind
That seeks to build instead
Of leaving others dead.

Dragonflies and Damselflies bright
And Griffonflies' sight
Are all members true
Of this warrior crew

That rules the air with might
From morning until night
In battles fierce and long
Where only strong

Survive to see another day
And find another way
To feed their hungry young
With songs that can't be sung

By those whose hearts are kind
And have a gentler mind
That seeks to nurture life
Instead of causing strife.

The Griffonflies grew wide—
Almost a meter's pride
Of wingspan strong and true
That carried them right through

The skies for seventy
Million years, you see—
They ruled with iron claw
And fought without a flaw

Until the world would change
And rearrange
The balance of the air
Where they had ruled with care

Their aerial domain
Through sunshine and through rain
For ages long and true
Beneath the skies of blue.

And Neopter became
Ancestor of the name
Of all the other kinds
Of insects with their minds

set on a different goals
And playing different roles
In evolution's grand
Design across the land.

Beetles, ants, and flies,
And million more that rise
Each morning with the sun
When day has just begun—

All trace their lineage back
To Neopter's track
That led from water's realm
With wisdom at the helm

To air and land so green
The greatest ever seen
Where insects could explore
From mountain peak to shore

Every niche and place
With beauty and with grace
That shows what life can be
When hearts and minds are free

To grow beyond the small
And heed the greater call
Of what they can become
When they are not numb

To possibilities
That nobody sees
But those who dare to dream
Of more than what they seem.

From Romulus' fight
To Hexapter's flight,
From underground streams deep
Where Remus' children keep

Their vigil in the dark
To Insectus' bright mark
Upon the world above
Built by those who love

The light and air so free
Throughout eternity,
The insects show us how

To make and keep our vow
To rise above the past
And make the good things last
While learning from the pain
Of those who died in vain

Because they could not see
What they were meant to be
If they had worked as one
Beneath the faithful sun

That shines on all who try
To reach beyond the sky
Of limitations old
In stories never told

Of what we can achieve
When we truly believe
In power of the light
To conquer endless night.

From Springtails' bounding hope
Beyond their earthly scope
To Bristletails that sweep
The air where eagles keep

Their watch for those who'd climb
Beyond the bonds of time
To find their destined place
In evolution's race,

The early insects show
How we can learn to grow
From humble, simple start
To mastery of art

That lifts us up on high
Beneath the starry sky
Where all our dreams come true
For me and you today.

From Carbonifer's choice
To give Rhea her voice
In bearing sons who'd build
What time has never killed:

The legacy of those
Who chose to oppose
The darkness and the death
With every living breath

They drew from air so free
Throughout eternity
And used to build a world
Where hope's flag was unfurled

For all who came behind
With heart and soul and mind
United in the quest
To give their very best

For future generations
Of all the faithful nations
Who'd learn from what they made
And never be afraid

To reach beyond the small
And heed the greater call
Of what they could become
When they were not numb

To possibilities
That nobody sees
But those with eyes to see
What they were meant to be.

The insects teach us all
Who hear their gentle call
That from the simplest start
We can master art

Of flying toward the light
That conquers endless night
And lifts us up to see
What we were meant to be

When we work together
Through every kind of weather
And help each other grow
Beyond what we can know

Alone, but when we share
Our burdens and our care,
The whole world can become
A place where all can come

To find their wings at last
And leave behind the past
Of crawling on the ground
Where hope could not be found

To soar into the sky
Where dreams will never die
But live forever more
From mountain peak to shore

In every heart that beats
With love that never retreats
From what is right and true
For me and you today.

From Romer's gap of death
To life's returning breath,
The Carboniferous age
Turned history's page

From darkness into light
With insects' wondrous sight
That showed the way to be
More than we seem to be

When we learn how to fly
Beneath the starry sky
Where all things are made new
For me and you today.
