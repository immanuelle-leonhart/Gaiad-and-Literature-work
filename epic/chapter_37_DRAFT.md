# Chapter 37: The Circulatory Revolution (DRAFT)

Among the sons of Cambrius bright
Two faced an issue grave:
Chordatus, son of Dutrus' light,
And Annelidus the brave.

Each one was blessed and supported well
By hydrostatic pressure high.
With water in their frame to dwell
They bore their body's cry.

Together they perceived the flaw
That movement brought their way:
When motion broke the ancient law
Their blood could not obey

The call to nourish organs through
Their length from head to tail.
They needed strength both tried and true
To make their systems hale.

So hearts they built with arteries strong
And veins like flowing seas,
To carry lifeblood along
Through all their mysteries.

Together each one made with care
Closed systems running true.
The blood would flow everywhere
And organs nourish through.

Our mighty bloodlines were born that day
When hearts showed them the path.
From hydrostatic's ancient way
To circulation's math.

From Annelon came two sons bright:
Segmentus when day began
And Ribbon, hunter of the night
Whose prey could never span.

Ribbon built a proboscis long
And venomous and keen.
From this weapon sharp and strong
His hunting skill was seen.

His sons are known in waters deep
As Ribbon Worms today
Who hunt their victims while they sleep
And poison them to slay.

Segmentus built his body wise
With segments that would grow
In numbers past all counting, rise
And resilient flow.

He built great strength throughout his form
With segments linked in chain.
Through every storm and earthly norm
His structures would remain.

With countless legs and bristles too
His segments carried on
Their industries, both tried and true,
From dusk until the dawn.

Each segment bore its faithful pair
Of legs beyond compare
To spread his children everywhere
With diligent care.

Segmentus bore two sons of might:
Pleistos when day begun
And Amphon of the ocean bright
Who lived in water's fun.

Amphon bore a son and daughter dear:
Amphinos of the sea
And great Sipuncula here
Who chose to live more free.

Amphinos became the sire
Of worms that burn like flame,
Fierce beasts with spikes of poison fire
In colors bright of fame.

We dare not tread upon their ground
Where they can be found dwelling.
Their beauty hides what we have found—
Death's poison they are selling.

Modern flags today still show
The colors that declare
Great honor to Amphinos' glow
With patterns bright and fair.

Sipuncula chose to be
So different in her way
That her own phylum, wild and free—
The peanut worms today.

Pleistos bore two sons of fame:
When dawn broke came sweet Vermo,
And wandering Errantius by name
Who roamed far from his home.

Errantius bore two children more:
Myzo the parasite, and for
Balance in nature's way,
Greatswimmer swam all day.

Greatswimmer bore a son and daughter fair:
Swift Phyllos of the water,
And Eunice, jealous everywhere,
Never mild like she ought to.

Eunice the vicious was
Jealous beyond all cause.
She stole her husband's manhood true
And made herself anew.

Without him she conceived with care
And daughters she received so fair.
These daughters fierce and bold
Are Bobbit Worms of old.

Phyllos bore many sons
More diverse than any one:
Swimmers of artistry bright
Across the sea's delight.

Syllides the lazy one
Never courted, never won
A mate through his own art—
He'd simply bud a part

Each month to chase the maids around
While he stayed safe and sound.
His lazy ways persist today
In every mating way.

Tomopteris breaks his fins
Like chaff when racing begins.
He swims and never lands upon
The sands from dusk to dawn.

Alciops the hawkeyed hunter bright
Whose vision has no peer.
His eyes surpass all others' sight
Who swim the waters clear.

And fair Aphrodite,
Ancestress of sea mice free.
Her daughters beautiful and true
Make oceans wonder anew.

Vermo bore four daughters fair:
Eartha who walked everywhere,
Sapion wise and bright and true,
Hestia of the ocean blue,

And great Orbinida of fame
Who earned eternal name
Through deeds of noble art
That touched each loving heart.

Eartha walked great distances wide
Across the earth with pride.
Her journeys never knew an end
From where horizons bend.

Sapion bore two daughters more:
Sabella, who would soar
With feathers bright as morning air,
And Spiona everywhere

With tentacles that gently sway
Throughout the night and day
Like dancers in the ocean's hall
Responding to its call.

Sabella's daughters live as those
Who fish where water flows.
They give us beauty in our halls—
The feather duster calls

Remind us worms can truly be
Both beautiful and free.
In every sacred, holy place
They show us nature's grace.

Hestia swam down deep and far
To Gaia's womb to keep
Her vigil in the dark like star,
Ancient patriarch of the deep.

She closed her gut with greatest care
And bacteria everywhere
Would help her live far below
Where others could not go.

Her daughters farm the depths profound
Where Gaia's treasures are found:
Riftia in volcanic vents bright
Where mountains' fiery light

Fills the water with their heat,
And where cold seeps compete,
Lamella makes her dwelling place
Where oil riches show their face.

Eartha bore a son and daughter dear:
Terraclithia of waters clear
And great Echiuron the wise
With art beyond our eyes.

Like great Sipuncula before,
Echiuron's sacred lore
Was so unique and divine
We thought her holy line

Worthy to be its own
Phylum, standing alone.
Her creativity so bright
Gave her sacred light.

Terraclithia bore two more:
Terebella to explore the shore
And Clitella, wise though small
But mother of them all.

Terebella bore three sons of might:
Spaghettes when came the light,
Pompeii of the burning fire,
And Acros to aspire.

Spaghettes used tentacles long
Like ropes both thick and strong
To snare his prey from distances far—
Miles away like a star.

Pompeii chose to dwell
In volcanic fiery hell.
Among the flames burning bright
He made his home each night.

Acros became the father true
Of forms that never tire:
Squidworm and Swima too
Swam with hearts on fire.

Clitella was small of head
But wisdom through her spread
To other organs wise and true—
Her offspring quickly grew

Beyond all counting, number blessed.
What bristles never guessed
She made up with her spawn:
Children from dusk to dawn.

Her children took to rivers flowing
Where waters kept on going.
Today we know them well indeed:
Earthworms who serve our need

To till the soil and tell us true
What earth needs us to do,
And Leeches who upon blood feed
From those they choose to meet.

From hydrostatic pressure's reign
To circulation's gain,
The worms found their destined way
To rule both night and day.

In every garden bed so fair
Where earthworms make their lair,
Remember great Annelon's line
That made the system fine.

In every ribbon worm that hunts
With poisonous stunts,
In every feather duster's grace
That beautifies each place,

In every fire worm burning bright
With colors full of light,
In every deep-sea farmer true
Working the ocean blue,

The legacy lives on and on
From dusk until the dawn
Of hearts and circulation
That blessed each population.

The sons of Cambrius learned that day
That when their bodies sway
And move through space and time,
Their blood must flow in rhyme

With needs of every part
From tail unto the heart.
The closed system they made
Will never ever fade.

In every beating heart today
That plays its vital way,
Remember those who built with care
The system we all share

That pumps our blood each day
In its circulatory way.
From Chordatus and Annelidus true
Came the gift to me and you.
