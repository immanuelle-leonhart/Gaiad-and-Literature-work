# Chapter 36: The Arthropod Radiation (DRAFT)

This is the chronicle we tell today
Of Arthur Ironfoot's noble way.
His sons would spread both far and wide
With evolution as their guide.

Arthur bore two sons of fame so bright:
Arthropus, double-legged with might,
And Fuxi, wise and strong and true,
Who lived his whole long lifetime through.

Arthropus the double-legged and strong
From him great lines were pledged lifelong.
Two sons he bore with mighty heart:
Bright Ferron and Isoxys' art.

From Ferron came two children more:
Megacheiron to explore the shore
And wise Euthyphro, keen and bright,
Who looked with knowing, piercing sight.

Megacheiron bore sons many and true,
Among them brave Pantopus who
Each day would hope that he might find
A mate both faithful, true, and kind.

Pantopus was lonely in that place
Until he met with maiden's grace.
Beautiful Pyka was her name,
Who set his loving heart aflame.

"You are all legs!" he cried with joy
To his beloved, without alloy.
And so they founded the great line
Of Sea Spiders most divine.

The Sea Spiders built cities strange and new
Throughout their ocean kingdom blue.
In their legs they safely stored
All the organs they adored:

Intestines dwelling in their limbs,
Genitals where salt water swims,
Gills within each leg they made—
No coelom's room they ever prayed.

All legs they truly were indeed
As Pantopus did plant the seed.
Their bodies lean and slight and small,
Their legs their glory over all.

Euthyphro bore two sons of might:
Insectus, born when came the light,
And keen Arachnus, strong and able,
With appendages most stable.

From great Insectus' noble line
The insects all would rise and shine.
From brave Arachnus would come forth
Arachnids, south and east and north.

The sons of Arachnus learned to bear
Great appendages with greatest care.
The sons of Insectus built and made
Great legs to serve their every trade.

Some lived in waters deep and blue,
Some walked on land their journey through.
Aquatic paths and terrestrial ways,
Both proved good throughout their days.

Insectus bore three sons so strong:
Mandibulus lived long,
Aquilonifer, wild and free,
And great Hymenocarina of the sea.

Mandibulus bore two children more:
Brave Crustaceus to explore
The waters deep and ocean wide,
And faithful Euthy by his side.

From great Crustaceus came the race
Of Crustaceans in every place.
The lobsters strong and crabs so keen
With claws the finest ever seen.

But brave Euthy chose the shore
Where mighty waves would crash and roar.
Upon the rocks so tall and high
Beneath the bright and open sky.

With water bears he chose to walk
Where dry and wet winds came to talk.
The land that made all breathing hard
They faced with courage, never scarred.

Here they laid their precious eggs
Between the strong stone ledges,
In gardens green of lichen bright
Their young would first see light.

From Euthy's brave descendants true
Who faced what land could do,
The mighty insects would arise
To conquer earth and fill the skies.

Great Arachnus bore two sons of fame:
When dawn broke came bright Trilos' name
And Serk of ancient, mighty renown
Who earned his legendary crown.

Serk bore many children dear,
Among them brave Chelicer here,
Hidden in shadows dark and deep,
And Sidney, secrets sworn to keep.

From brave Chelicer's noble line
The spiders all would rise and shine.
All arachnids eight-legged and true
From his bloodline proudly grew.

Today in every corner small
Where webs catch victims in their fall,
For flies caught in their silken snare,
Chelicer's children still are there.

Among great Trilos' daughters bright
Who ruled the waters in their might
Were Trilobon the gracious queen,
Marrella, ghostly pale and seen,

Esmeralda, jewel-bright and fair,
And great Retifacia's stare
That pierced through water's deepest blue
To see what mortals never knew.

Marrella, soft and pale as mist,
Told ghostly tales that none could twist.
She became ancestress
Of Marellans, none the less.

Like phantoms in the ocean deep
They lived where waters safely sleep.
Soft-bodied and ethereal,
Almost quite immaterial.

Great Trilobon bore four children dear
In waters crystal, bright, and clear:
Trilobeth the mighty queen,
Strong Xander, bold and keen,

Sweet Necta, gentle, fair, and bright,
And brave Helmut's noble sight
Who wandered everywhere around
Where ocean's songs could be found.

Trilobeth became the mother true
Of Trilobites—no others knew
Such rulers of the boundless sea
Could match their great dynasty.

Through their conquest, vast and wide,
They brought with them, side by side,
The great Yakutian era's dawn
When ancient ways were withdrawn.

Great Trilobeth bore two sons of might:
When day broke came Redlich bright
And Agnos, wise and gray and old,
With sacred stories to be told.

From brave Redlich came the line
Of houses most divine:
Great Corynex built his house
With wisdom none could rouse.

From brave Corynex came Lichida
Who built his great armada.
His house grew strong and wide and great
With fortune as their fate.

From proud Lichida came Odontos,
Builder of great crontos.
His spiny house arose on high
To challenge earth and sea and sky.

From brave Ptychos, Redlich's brother,
Came four sons like no other:
Strong Proetes, brave and true,
Asaphus of waters blue,

Great Harpeth of the depths profound,
And brave Phacos, who never found
A reason he should ever sleep
While watching o'er the deep.

Each founded their own noble line
With traits both strong and fine.
The Trilobites spread far and wide
Across the ocean's rolling tide.

For millions of years they reigned supreme
While other life could only dream.
The rulers of the boundless sea
Through all their great dynasty.

Their compound eyes could clearly see
Through all eternity.
No detail could escape their gaze,
Their vision's perfect, shining rays.

Segmented bodies strong they bore
With legs by the countless score.
Each segment had its faithful pair
To walk through waters bright and fair.

They molted as they grew in size
Like arthropods before our eyes.
Each stage brought them greater might
Beneath the ocean's starry light.

The great Yakutian time had come
When Trilobites were the sum
Of all success could ever be
In their vast dynasty.

From Arthur's great innovation bright
Came this radiation's light:
Insects, spiders, crabs so fine,
Each with their own design.

The Sea Spiders, strange and new,
Extended their range through and through
With organs dwelling in each limb—
A body plan both sleek and slim.

The Crustaceans in the sea
Built their great dynasty.
The insects on the land so wide
Spread with their courage and their pride.

The arachnids eight-legged and true
From brave Chelicer's bloodline grew.
In shadows deep they chose to dwell
With stories they could always tell.

But none could match the lasting fame
Of Trilobites by name.
For endless eons they held sway
Until their final, fading day.

From Pantopus and Pyka's love so true
To rulers high and new,
Arthur's legacy would spread
Long after he was dead.

In every arthropod today
That walks along its way,
His biramous limb design
Lives on through space and time.

The double-legged innovation bright
Sparked radiation's light
That filled both sea and land complete
With creatures strong and neat.

In every spider's silken web
That catches life at ebb,
In every insect's graceful flight
Through day and through the night,

In every lobster's powerful claw
That follows nature's law,
In every crab that sideways walks
Where ocean beauty talks,

Remember Arthur's sacred art
That gave them all their start.
The Ironfoot legacy so bright
Lives through eternal light.

The sons of Arthur proved with care
How innovation everywhere
Could move the world from simple forms
To complexity that warms

The heart of those who truly see
This vast diversity.
From one ancestral line so true
Came forms both old and new.

The great Yakutian age begun
When Trilobites had won
Their place as rulers brave and true
Of waters deep and blue.

But time would show once more
That even greatest lore
And creatures in their prime
Must yield to passing time.

Yet Arthur's gift lives on and on
From dusk until the dawn
In every jointed leg that walks
Where life eternal talks

For forms both strong and true
To see the journey through.
The arthropods remain today
Through sun and storm and rain.
