# Chapter 54: The Devonian Dawn (DRAFT)

Devon's city was the greatest sight
Among all cities burning bright and true,
The new era gained its name from his might—
Devonian age where wisdom grew.

As Devon sat upon his throne of stone,
He sucked pure water through his gill so bright,
Between his jaws the golden flow was known
To bring him oxygen both day and night.

Through spiracle the water filled his sight
With sacred breath that millenia wrought,
His gills received the flow of hemoglobin's might
That carried life to every blessed thought.

Through countercurrent's wise and faithful art,
His blood took oxygen like faithful men
Who know the secret of their truest part
In life's eternal dance beyond our ken.

When Devon moved through waters crystal clear,
He opened wide his mouth to let it glide
Through gills so tried and true throughout each year
With current's gentle flow to be his guide.

When he found prey to make his hunger cease,
He cleaved it with his jaw of mighty strength,
And behind teeth that gleamed like morning's peace
His powerful jaws would work at any length.

Deep in his stomach acids kept their guard
Through every watch of day and sacred night,
While pancreas and gallbladder worked hard
To purify his food with all their might.

His spiral intestine without end
Would help his frame transcend its earthly bound,
As portal veins their precious cargo send:
Sweet fats and sugars where life could be found.

His liver cleaned his blood with faithful care,
While kidneys filtered waste both night and day,
Through cloaca went what life could never bear,
Wisdom of design showed nature's way.

When Devon wed his bride beyond compare,
He released his sperm into her loving sight,
From millions of his children bright and fair
Two would be chosen for eternal light:

Great Llŷr and noble Stennisio,
Both glorious in their appointed way,
While Stennisio's sons would ever go
Across the seafloor, eating clams each day.

But Llŷr begat brave Bran the strong and true,
Who lived his life in wisdom and in might,
And Bran begat Caradoc, solid too
As mountain stone throughout each day and night.

Caradoc begat three sons of fame:
Great Cynan of the sea so deep and wide,
Bold Acantho, who'd honor his name,
And Sudopedal by the ocean's side.

From Cynan came brave Cadwr as his heir,
Who'd guide with gentle force but never turn
His subjects from their course with loving care,
That wisdom's ways they'd faithfully learn.

And Cadwr begat noble Eudaf,
Who'd never mock those trying their best,
While Eudaf sired Morfawr (though his staff
Was peace, not war) who'd give the world its rest.

Morfawr begat two sons of different mind:
Brave Tudwal when the morning light begun,
And Rhineheart, flattened, hidden, hard to find
Like rays before their fame was ever won.

From Tudwal came two sons of different way:
Bold Cynfawr who would travel far to find
His destined home, and rebel Antiarch
Who plotted revolution in his mind.

Antiarchon rebelled against all law
That ancestors had held as sacred truth,
He lived beneath the soil where none would draw
Near to his lair, an anarchistic youth.

For prey he'd always wait in ambush deep
To seal their fate with strikes from far below,
His revolutionary mind would keep
Its plots to make his enemies' blood flow.

But Cynfawr chose a different path instead,
His son Custennin would travel far and wide
Until by dreams and visions he was led
To China's fertile ground to be his guide.

Custennin begat two sons of worth:
Great Uther, tried and true in every way,
And bright Petallon, who filled the earth
With beauty's sight throughout each passing day.

From Uther came two children beyond ken:
Great Arthur and bold Maxil the strong,
And Arthur bore a son and daughter when
His time had come to join the eternal song.

Arthur the Younger and fair Ptycho,
Whose beauty none could ever hope to match,
And from her daughters would arise below
One blessed soul that heaven's plan would catch.

Fair Mary, Mother of Icthys blessed,
Would bear the gift of placenta's love
Millions of years before all the rest—
A nurturing gift from realms above.

Arthur the Younger bore three sons to fame:
Bold Mordred with rebellion in his heart,
Great Wuttago, who'd honor his name,
And bright Actino, who'd play his part.

But Mordred turned against his father's way
And bore two sons in darkness and in shame:
Evil Philip and Melehan, whose day
Would blacken and dishonor his name.

From Melehan came Brachy, strong in might,
Whose sons would overthrow Silur's line
And rule the world with power, not with right,
Though once Silur's rule was so divine.

Great Brachy bore three sons of different mind:
Bold Eubar of the sea so deep and wide,
Strong Buchan wild, and Homosteus designed
To rule with power as his only guide.

From Eubar came two sons in time:
Great Pachos, tried and true in every way,
And Coccos, living by the sea's sweet rhyme
Beneath the ocean's gentle, rolling spray.

Bold Pachos bore two children of renown:
Great Dunkella, who'd grow beyond compare,
And bright Aspino, who'd win the crown
Of beauty with his radiance bright and fair.

Dunkella grew to be the greatest sight
Among all Metazo beneath the sun:
Six meters high, with power and with might,
Three Jaekelopterii when all was done.

Though not as long as strong Cameroceras,
She ruled with thousand times his warrior's might,
Her iron hand controlled the world's vast areas
In that great age of fire's blazing light.

But from great Arthur's brother Maxil came
A child like none that earth had ever known:
Qilinyu was his blessed name,
Who'd make the ancient bloodline's glory shown.

Qilinyu begat Entelognathus,
Whose jaw was complete from head to ground,
And he begat brave Janusicthus,
With newer art that would astound.

Great Janusicthus brought his teeth so bright
From gills unto his jaw with gleaming power,
His skull contained within his head gave sight
To nerves that served him every blessed hour.

He became the noble father true
Of all who'd be both fish and beast combined,
From greatest unto least, both old and new,
His legacy in every form we find.

From Devon's city great and Janusicthus' fate
That led to fish and more throughout the sea,
The tale shows how innovation's art so great
Can solve each problem for eternity.

From gill to lung to jaw that follows law,
Each change that life would make through time
Was for survival, but we also saw
How some choose violence and some choose rhyme.

The Devonian age wrote on history's page
The story of the choice 'tween different voice:
The voice of builders and destructive rage—
Each generation makes this sacred choice.

From Devon's peaceful ways throughout his days
To Brachy's rule that made the world his tool,
The lesson's clear in many different ways:
We choose what kind of world our hearts will rule.

From Devon's spiracle to Dunkella's might,
The vertebrates show how life finds its way
From darkest night into the blessed light
Of possibility's eternal day.

The Devonian dawn when old forms were withdrawn
And newer forms took their place in time
Was built by those who dared to dream each dawn
And care for more than their own earthly climb.

From Devon's city bright to fish with sight,
The age shows what can grow when courage flows
Through every choice we make to bring the light
Of love to every heart that seeks and knows

The truth that we become what we choose
And what we leave for those who'll come behind,
We are the ones who either win or lose
The battle for each heart and soul and mind.

The Devonian age began with more
Than mortal plan to make the world more bright
With love's eternal light that will endure
Through every heart that chooses what is right.
