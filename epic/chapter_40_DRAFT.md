# Chapter 40: The First Extinction and Mollusk Rise (DRAFT)

Fire rained down from the sky above
And many died who once knew love.
The first extinction came with flame
Of death's devouring, bitter name.

For years in heaven's sacred height
Hengweh and Mithra waged their fight.
They wrestled in the air so bright
And blocked the sun's life-giving light.

The great Archaeocyathids fell,
Their cities rang with death's dark knell.
The Trilobites and many more—
Brachiopods by the sacred score—

And Hyoliths could barely survive
That calamity to stay alive.
The Botomian time had passed away,
Its glory could not last the day.

Then blessed Mithra spoke these words
To one who serves among the herds:
"Great Wiwaxius, I choose thee
To set the world's life ever free.

Restore what has been lost in strife
And count extinction's cost of life.
Protect us from the doom so dire
That fills each room with deadly fire."

Great Wiwaxius bore two sons of worth:
Bold Molluscus from his birth,
And poor Kamptos, weak and small,
Who had no strength to heed the call

Of great things or mighty deeds.
He built what barely ever feeds
A small and brainless state so drear—
A kingdom with no fate to cheer.

But blessed Molluscus bore so many
Sons, more than ever any
Other patriarch could claim in fame.
Eldest was great Testar's name.

Great Testar the sixteen-plated
Built his shell sophisticated.
A great thick shell he made with care
Of valves in organized affair.

Sixteen valves in all he'd place:
Eight large and eight small in space.
Eight upon the right side bright
And eight upon the left in sight.

His brothers had no care or thought
For building what they truly ought.
Bad work ethics they possessed,
Never did they do their best.

Solenos just drank the blood
Of sons through ocean's crimson flood:
Ctenofer and Cnider's line bright
Became his bloody wine of night.

And Caudos ate his fill with greed
Of Foramer to meet his need.
He cared not for the sacred art
Of building any vital part.

But blessed Testar bore two sons:
Great Chiton when the day begun
And wise Conchifer Verticus,
Both builders bright and glorious.

Great Chiton Horizontus
Unified like blessed kratos
His shells in horizontal line:
Eight shells in tableau divine.

He became ancestor true
Of chitons who pursue
With eight shells side by side
Along their lengthy, armored hide.

The noble sons of Chiton roll
When threatened from their goal.
But they aren't very wise—
They gave up wisdom's prize

Long ago in time now past,
Their simple ways held fast.
Intelligence they traded bright
For armor free from blight.

Great Conchifer Verticus
Made his way most glorious
By unifying vertical
His shells so beautiful.

A shell upon his left side bright,
A shell upon his right—
His vertical design was blessed
Of horizontal sight.

Great Conchifer bore two more:
Bold Bivos to explore
The hinged shell's sacred way,
And Monos every day.

Great Bivos kept his hinged design
While Monos made combine
His shells into just one—
Two paths when day begun.

Great Bivos laid in sand so bright
Throughout the land of light
And fished food from the sea
Most gracefully and free.

When threatened he would close with might
His shells against the fight.
Together they would shut secure
Like door forever pure.

His children came to lay their form
Upon their sides each morn.
Soon they looked the same as those
Of Brachios' lineage.

They became Bivalves true and bright:
Clams and mussels in sight,
Oysters in their beds so fair
With heads beyond compare.

The noble sons of Monos first
Found little luck, dispersed
Without much success or fame.
But time would bless their name

With patient, single shell so true.
Monoplacophores pursue
With nothing but one plate of might
As their identifying sight.

But Carlos the curly one,
Grandson when day begun,
Had ideas quite different
From others' management.

He walked across the seas so wide
Exploring with faithful pride,
Discovering countless things that bring
Wonder on the wing.

He bore two sons of lasting fame:
Great Gastropus was the name
Of one, and wise Digitos
The other, strong and close.

Great Gastropus twisted round
Into spiral most profound.
His shell developed sacred might
Through this spiraling sight.

He became ancestor blessed
Of snails, their protector
With shells that coil and turn
In patterns we discern.

Each generation would do more
To curl than those before
And grow in strength each day
Through their spiraling way.

Today his distant sons so bright
Still coil when comes the light.
From garden snail so small and true
To conch shells of ocean blue.

Great Digitos made his foot
Into tentacles to suit
A different kind of life so bright
Through joy and sacred sight.

Great Digitos bore two sons of worth:
Bold Cephalopus from birth,
And wise Scaphopus too,
Not quite so glorious and true.

Great Cephalopus studied long
And made his body strong
Through learning how to fly on high
With buoyancy in sky.

He built a coiling shell with care
With chambers dwelling there
With gas for floating light and free
Through night across the sea.

Through this he learned to soar above
The ocean floor with love.
He even built with sacred care
Circulatory system there

Like blessed Annelids and those
Of Chordates who propose
That closed systems are the best
For meeting every test.

His mind grew sharp and ever keen,
The brightest ever seen
Among the mollusks all who call
Upon the ocean's hall.

But Scaphopus lived lazy days
In ground of misty haze.
He became ancestor blessed
Of tusk shells, protector

Of nothing but his ease and rest.
Simple creatures are blessed
With brainless ways so free,
Living eternally

Underground they always dwell
Within their tusk-like shell.
They prey on Foramer's sons bright
When hunting time takes flight.

Through this blessed story we learn true
How small choices renew
Great consequences far and wide
Across time's flowing tide.

The noble sons of Molluscus grew
And flourished, spreading through
The world in every way so bright,
Taking roles of light

That others could not fill with grace.
Through strength of mind's embrace
They rose from extinction's fire
To heights that all admire

Great and ever glorious.
Molluscus victorious
Showed how from single start so true
Many forms pursue

To fill each niche and sacred place
With their unique grace.
From simple shell began the plan
Of evolution's span

That led to snails that crawl on land
And squids by wisdom's hand
With intelligence so bright
And bivalves' filtering sight.

The first extinction's flame of night
Could not destroy the light
Of those who build with sacred care
Their future everywhere.

When fire rained from sky above
And many lost all love,
The builders who remained were those
Who from destruction rose

With vision through the dark so deep
And left their mark to keep
On world that needed those who'd stand
And work with faithful hand.

Great Wiwaxius heard the call
To save life from the fall
And through his chosen sons so bright
New chapters brought to light

Of life upon the earth so fair
That celebrates with care
The worth of building something strong
That will endure so long.

From Testar's sixteen plates of might
To forms that bring delight
In endless variety,
The mollusks' piety

To building shows the way so true
That life can make it through
Against extinction's threat so dire
When builders' skills inspire

To work with patient art divine
That plays the part so fine
In restoration's sacred song
That makes the weak grow strong.
