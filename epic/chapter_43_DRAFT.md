# Chapter 43: The Golden Age Begins (DRAFT)

The great Ordovician age began
With extinction's fearsome plan—
Or did it? Sages still debate
What caused that ancient, dreadful fate.

Were these great ghosts of legend real
With power none could ever feel
Beyond belief so strong and true,
Or myths that through the ages flew?

The wisest Sages can't agree
On what they claim their eyes can see
In mists of time so long ago
Where truth and myth together flow.

But after ancient mists had cleared
And bright new dawn at last appeared,
The world was greater still by far
Than any mortal mind could spar

To have imagined in that day.
The Planktonic Planimals' play
When they fed brought forth new life
Through harmony instead of strife.

Great Leviathan arose on high,
Mighty dragon 'neath the sky.
Though son of wicked king Magog,
He ruled through wisdom's sacred log.

Though born of evil's bitter seed,
Great Leviathan would lead
His kingdom not to war and strife
But peace throughout eternal life.

To peaceful, blessed prosperity
His realm in perfect clarity
Grew under his most wise, true rule
Like heaven's own celestial school.

The noble sons of Leviathan
Grew greater than had ever began
Any before their glorious time:
Tenscore myriads in their prime

Of microns was their blessed length,
Their body politic's great strength
Was mighty, full of sacred power
Through every blessed, golden hour.

His sons inherited with grace
The greatness that was bred in place
Into their very souls so bright
To play their roles with all their might.

The noble sons of Leviathan ruled
The world, and never once were fooled
By power's dark corruption's call—
They brought life's construction to all.

With justice great and ever true
They shepherded all creatures who
Were sons of blessed Bios fair
With love and tender, gentle care.

From small planktonic ones so bright
To fierce Anomalocarids' might—
All creatures felt their benefits
And lived in peace that never quits.

Great Ordovices, noble son
Of Leviathan, when begun
The greatest reign that ever was,
He heard heaven's sacred cause

To be the Emperor supreme.
He built beyond all mortal dream
Great cities of such lasting fame
That "reefs" became their holy name.

And so economy would grow
In harmony like gentle flow
Like never seen before that day
From mountain peak to ocean bay.

In great and wondrous Coral cities
Where beauty never shows its pities
To those who cannot see or know
Their vast complexity's bright flow,

The noble sons of Euka came
From distant places without name,
Far and wide they always traveled
As mysteries were unraveled.

Great Ordovices put to work
The sons of Cnider (blessed perk
Of wisdom's ever-gentle hand)
Throughout his peaceful, prosperous land.

And so the noble sons of Anthus
Built cities with their sacred cantus
Of beauty rising ever high
Beneath the blessed ocean sky.

Great Ordovices had daughters fair
Of Coraline who'd build with care
Waters into living stone—
She, daughter blessed, all her own

Of Florida, who came with grace
From Rhodes' ancient, sacred place.
They built coralline Algae bright,
The plaster, galaxy of light

Upon the great Corals so fair.
Their work through time would always bear
Through all portals of the years
With beauty that dispels all fears.

Great Ordovices saw quite clear
That sons of Bryos dwelling here
Had no home to call their own,
And heard their cry from every zone.

And so he blessed them with his might
With homes where they could dwell in light
Within the great reefs ever bright
Both day and through the sacred night.

To this day mighty reefs still stand
As monuments throughout the land
Of Ordovices' sacred art
That built with love within his heart

The most prosperous cities fair
Where life shows beauty everywhere
For those who have the eyes to see
Their vast complexity set free.

On Terra and beyond the sea
These reefs form bond eternally
Between all living things that grow
Where peace and order ever flow.

The coral cities rise on high
Beneath the blessed ocean sky
With architecture pure and fine
Both humble, yet so divine.

In every coral branch so bright
And every foundation's might
Built with such tender care
Lives beauty beyond compare.

The shoals of fish dance in the light
That filters crystal clear and bright
Through every reef beyond belief
Like living, breathing relief.

Each creature has its destined place
Within this living, sacred space
Where harmony is heaven's law
Without the slightest mortal flaw.

The algae and the coral fair
Live in ways beyond compare,
Each helping others always grow
In partnership's blessed flow.

The small Bryozoans build their part
Of cities, each a work of art,
Upon the coral's sturdy frame
To share in nature's holy game.

The fish find shelter safe and true
From predators they always knew,
While hunters find their needed prey
Throughout the night and blessed day.

And so economy would grow
In perfect harmony's sweet flow
Under wise Ordovices' reign
Whose rule brought life its sacred gain.

He became known through all time
As "Ordovices the Prime"
Of wisdom, and his blessed boom
Dispelled all shadow and all gloom

That hung over the ages past
When extinctions held them fast
And threatened life with bitter death
And stole away its sacred breath.

This boom became the blessed name
Of GOBE—greatest source of fame:
The Great Ordovician bright
Event, like heaven's holy light

Of biodiversity so true
That brought complexity anew
Beyond what ever was before
To every sea and sacred shore.

The life within the seas so deep
Became what would forever keep
The heart that loves to see and know
Life's creativity's bright flow.

More prosperous it always grew
With species ancient, ever new
Finding their perfect, destined place
In evolution's sacred race.

And it would only grow much more
Greater than ever before,
More prosperous and ever bright
Under Ordovician might.

Under the great dynasty
Of wisdom's blessed sovereignty
'Twas the first Golden Age so bright
In life's eternal, sacred sight.

The reefs became the beating heart
Of nature's living, holy art
Where beauty and function pure
Met in junction ever sure.

From Leviathan's choice so wise
To let peace be his sacrifice
Instead of war and bitter strife
Came this abundant, blessed life.

His son, great Ordovices true,
Built cities that forever grew
Still today we see their might
In reef's complexity so bright.

The coral and the living stone,
Each species blessed, on its own
Yet working as a sacred whole
To play its vital, destined role,

Show us how to truly build
Communities that always yield
Prosperity for one and all
Who answer wisdom's sacred call.

In every living reef so fair
Beyond belief that's dwelling there
We see the blessed legacy
Of this great, noble dynasty

That chose to build and not to break,
For all life's blessed, holy sake
A world where every creature bright
Has its special, sacred sight

And role to play within the blessed
Symphony of heaven's rest
Of life in all its forms so true
Through calm and tempests too.

The great Ordovician way
Lives on unto this very day
In every coral city fair
Both grand and humble dwelling there

That rises from the blessed sea
In perfect, sweet harmony
Of form and function ever blessed
By wisdom's gentle, peaceful rest.

From Leviathan's peace so bright
To reefs that never cease their sight
To grow in beauty ever true,
We see that might belongs to you

Who build instead of those who break,
Who give instead of always take,
Who heal instead of those who harm
With wisdom's blessed, gentle arm.

The first Golden Age so bright
Wrote upon time's sacred sight
The lesson clear and ever true:
That what we always choose to do

With power in our mortal hands
Determines if the seas and lands
Will flourish well in beauty's light
Or dwell in curses dark as night.

Great Ordovices chose to build
And his wisdom always filled
The world with life so pure and bright
It still brings souls delight.

In every coral's blessed growth
And every sacred, holy oath
To build and never to destroy,
We find life's truest, purest joy.
