While sons of Cambrius flourished well
In seas where they would dwell,
The sons of Symbio-Mygus
And daughters of Charina-Plantus

Pushed frontiers far and wide
Across the world's divide.
But soon they faced
Competition in their place.

For Euthy, daughter brave
Of Mandibulus, who gave
Her all to save her young,
Was being chased among

The waters by her foe:
Anomalocaris, who'd show
No mercy in his chase
Across that watery space.

Her precious eggs needed care
And protection everywhere.
So she did what she must—
In Hausa placed her trust.

She jumped through shimmering sky
Up rocks that reached so high
To heavens bright above,
Protecting those she'd love.

And so she burst from sea
Onto the land so free.
The first to make that leap
From waters dark and deep.

Upon the ground she fell,
Suffocating well
In air so thin and strange,
Throughout that foreign range.

But she and husband true
Protected eggs they knew
Must live until the end—
Their legacy to send.

Among brave Euthy's daughters
Who left the ancient waters
Was Myry the trepanated,
By circumstance created.

Like sisters she was born
But water made her mourn—
She suffocated there
In ocean's liquid lair.

Her father, seeing this,
Pierced holes he would not miss
Above her ten thousand legs
Where breathing never begs.

Through these holes she was free
To receive directly
Hausa's blessings pure
Into her frame so sure.

Her descendants to this day
Still breathe in this way.
The holes that saved her life
Cut through terrestrial strife.

And so the daughters all
Of Myry heard the call
To breathe the air so sweet—
The Myriapods complete.

Myry the pierced explored
The new lands she adored.
She found she wasn't lone
Upon this earthly zone.

Tradition names this place
"Myry's coast" in grace,
But she was not the first—
History's truth rehearsed

Now calls it "Coast of Three
Kingdoms" truthfully
To honor every side
Of history's great tide.

Myry saw with wonder
Cities torn asunder
By neither rain nor thunder:
Lichen cities, born

Of covenant between
Symbio-Mygus, seen
With Charina-Planta's line—
Partnership divine.

Sprawling cities wide
Half mold and moss beside
Each other living well:
Mycelium would delve

Deep down to earthly gold
While thallus, brave and bold,
Basked in the sun's bright blessing
From heaven's light caressing.

These cities spread so far
Beneath each shining star.
When cities met they'd marry—
Both fungi and plant carried

On their ancient vow
To live together now.
Each nation wed the other
Like sister and like brother.

But Myry was not gentle
In her ways elemental.
She ate the cities whole
And stole what made them whole.

But as she ran around
She dropped on fertile ground
Cells scattered everywhere
Throughout the atmosphere.

Across the globe they fell,
Her messy eating spell
Left pieces of her meal
For others to steal.

Soon sons of Mygus built
Cities without guilt
With daughters of Charina
Across each earthly arena.

But Myry bore two sons:
Cain when day begun
And Abel, gentle, mild,
Her peaceful, loving child.

In process of time came
When each would bring by name
An offering so true
To Mithra's judgment due.

Cain brought the fruit
Of ground beneath his foot.
Abel brought the best
Of flocks that he possessed.

And Mithra had respect
For Abel's offering, blessed
His sacrifice so true,
But Cain's he did eschew.

Then Cain was wroth and fell
His countenance, unwell.
The Lord said unto Cain:
"Why is thy heart in pain?

If thou doest well,
Shalt thou not excel?
But if thou doest wrong,
Sin's desire is strong."

But Cain talked with Abel
His brother at their table.
And when they were alone
Cain's hatred had grown.

In field he rose against
His brother, and dispensed
With Abel's gentle life—
Murder's sharpened knife.

And Mithra called to Cain:
"Where is thy brother slain?"
"I know not," Cain replied,
"Am I to be his guide?"

"What hast thou done today?
Thy brother's blood doth pray
From ground where he was killed—
Thy curse shall be fulfilled.

No more shall ground give strength
To thee through all thy length
Of days upon this earth—
A wanderer from thy birth."

Then Cain cried out in fear:
"My punishment too dear!
From earth and thee I'm driven,
No rest to me is given.

A fugitive I'll be,
And whosoever shall see
Me wandering shall slay—
I cannot get away."

But Mithra marked him well:
"Whoever thee shall fell,
Sevenfold vengeance shall
Upon that person fall."

And Cain went forth in shame
To land of Nod by name,
East of Eden's gate
To meet his chosen fate.

There Cain knew his wife
And built a city-life.
She bore him Centipus,
Son glorious.

The city bore the name
Of Centipus' fame.
And Cain became ancestor
Of Caintipedes, predecessor

(Misspelled by Romans old
As "centipedes," we're told)
Who hunt with poison bite
Throughout the day and night.

But Abel's gentle wife
Was heavy with new life
When Cain's rage tore apart
Her husband's gentle heart.

In million pieces small
Abel's body fell.
His wife, with child blessed,
Became ancestress

Of millipedes so mild
Who harm not beast or child
But eat the leaves that fall
And decompose them all.

Enraged at Abel's death
Myry drew her breath
And lunged at Cain with might—
They fought their final fight.

Both passed to Ghedos' realm
Where death holds the helm.
But in their corpses lay
Seeds for another day.

In death, Mygus' sons
Took revenge for wrongs done.
Hera, daughter true,
And Freyr, strong through and through,

In twentieth generation
Found habitation
Within the corpses cold
Of stories that were told.

As they grew within
They built cities therein.
Their hyphae met at last
When growing time had passed.

When they met they wed
But heard what Mithra said:
"O couple great and true,
Prosperity's with you.

But barren you shall be
For decades, wait and see.
Postpone your marriage-bed
Until I give word instead.

When children you shall bear
They'll multiply everywhere
And fill the earth with life
As husband and as wife."

They followed his command
And through the fertile land
They married cells alone,
Not nuclei their own.

Each cell was shared by two,
Each nucleus lived through
In every cell they made—
Their sacrifice well-paid.

Dikaryotic cells
Their story always tells
Of patience and of love
Blessed from above.

Decades they waited long
Decomposing strong
The daughters of Myry—
Their patient ministry.

They became ancestors
Of high fungi, processors
Of death into new life:
Mushrooms and knife

Of penicillin's power
To heal in darkest hour.
The great fungi arose
From where their love chose

To wait for Mithra's word
And let their love be heard
Through patience in the ground
Where wisdom could be found.

Among great Plantus' sons
Who stayed when day begun
With sons of Mygus were
Two brothers everywhere:

Stomatos and Hepatos,
Who chose their separate ways.
Connected to network
Of cells that always work

At cellular level
They built partnership's revel
With sons of Glomulus
So glorious.

Stomatos saw the holes
In Myry's sides and souls.
He pierced himself as well
To breathe and to excel.

But Hepatos refused
The foreign magic, used
His ancient ways instead
And kept his faithful tread.

Hepatos became the sire
Of Liverworts' choir
Who keep the ancient way
Until this very day.

But Stomatos became
Ancestor of fame
Of all other plants
Who dance their living dance.

Today we honor him
As Eloh, not dim
But bright transhumanist
Who never would desist

From being better still
Through strength of mind and will.
When beliefs must change
He'd rearrange

His understanding true
To make his vision new.
Always growing more
Than he had been before.

As sons of Stomatos
Rose like kratos
Hillu struck back in rage
Upon that earthly stage.

So many lineages
Through all their pilgrimages
Would be lost forever more
On that primeval shore.

The Coast of Three Kingdoms
Where life's great wisdom
First met upon the land
By Mithra's guiding hand.

Plant and fungi wed
While arthropods were fed
On both their partnership—
The first tri-partnership.

From sea to land they came,
Each seeking their own fame.
But partnership proved best
Above all the rest.

The lichen cities showed
How love's seeds could be sowed
Between the most unlike
To share each other's hike

Through life upon the earth
Where partnership gives birth
To beauty none could see
In isolation's spree.

From Euthy's desperate leap
To save her children deep
Came Myry's pierced way
Of breathing every day.

From Cain and Abel's strife
Came death and new life:
Centipedes who hunt
And millipedes who shunt

Decay into rich earth
For new plants' birth.
From fungi's patient love
Blessed from above

Came mushrooms' mighty power
In earth's darkest hour.
From Stomatos' brave change
Came plants' wide range.

The Coast of Three Kingdoms
Shows how life's wisdom
Finds its truest way
Through partnership's display.
