# Chapter 57: The Vertebrate Houses (DRAFT)

Here is the book of generations blessed
From Janus' line of glory, bright and true,
How three great houses came to rule and rest
As pillars strong in evolution's view.

Janusicthus begat two sons of fame:
Kondricthus noble, strong in every way,
And bright Osticthus, bearer of the name
Of those who'd rule beneath the ocean's spray.

Their waters turned to poison, thick with death,
Suffocating children yet unborn,
No place where any soul could draw sweet breath
Or find a home free from the toxic scorn.

One day they prayed with all their faithful might
To great Elohim's everlasting throne
For some solution to their bitter plight,
That they might not face darkness all alone.

One hundred trilobites they sacrificed
And gave them to the heaven's shining dome,
Then waited for reply beneath the Christ
Of stars that blessed their underwater home.

And great Elohim spoke to faithful men:
"I shall grant to one of you this day
A gift both strange and true beyond your ken:
The sight to see where starlight's golden ray

Breaks through all earthly barriers and walls,
And to the other I will surely give
What never dies when mortal body falls:
A nose to smell the scents by which you'll live.

All chemicals that flow through earth and sea
Will be revealed that you might learn and grow
In wisdom's ways through all eternity
And rule the depths where ocean currents flow."

Great Chondricthus declared with royal pride:
"As eldest I shall make the choice today—
The nose I'll take to be my faithful guide
To rule the boundless sea in every way.

I'll hunt the placoderms with scenting power
And conquer all their spirit of resistance
Throughout each day and every passing hour
With skill that knows no limits or distance."

And so he was granted then and there
A nose beyond compare in all the world:
A thousand scents could tell his story fair
Of how his hunting banners were unfurled.

But bright Osticthus received instead
What blessed his lineage through all time:
A ring of bone around his eyes that led
To vision clear and sight so sublime.

The lens that held his sight within its sphere
And cells both new and bright beyond compare:
Cone cells that could detect each color clear
And all the hues that dance upon the air.

His perfect vision of the world could see
Possibilities in beauty's gentle dwell,
In every shade and hue that light sets free
With stories that his children yet would tell.

And so the noble sons of blessed sight
Osticthus learned to rule by vision clear,
While mighty sons of Kondricthus' might
Ruled by the scents that they could always hear.

Great Chondricthus could smell from waters far
Sweet streams that called like some celestial star
From distant homes across the ocean foam
To waters that would be his future home.

While bright Osticthus with his gifted eyes
Could see the clean air, bright and crystal free,
Of heaven high above the earth that lies
Beneath the dome of blue eternity.

Acanthus, noble son of Chondricthus,
When all his youthful training days were done,
Challenged the mighty realm so glorious
Of Placoderms beneath the blazing sun.

He built a skeleton both strong and light,
Not made of bone but built upon the base
Of cartilage both soft yet filled with might
That served him well through all his time and space.

His blessed wife would lay just precious few
Eggs that were treasures, tried and tested true,
That they would care for with their love so new
Both day and night until their time was due.

One blessed day Osticthus swam his way
Up great Elivagar's sacred stream—
The river that displays to us today
Mississippi's power and her dream.

Osticthus learned to breathe the sacred air
Through spiracles with reverent, loving care,
As he opened his gills beyond compare
To find what every seeking spirit's prayer

Would lead him to discover in the deep
Of wisdom's well that never shall run dry,
And then he pushed the air he'd learned to keep
Down his throat like crown worn from the sky.

And so his spiracles became the door
For air, not water's flow, to enter in—
A change that helped him grow much more
Than he had ever dreamed that he could win.

Osticthus married fair Eutelea bright,
Beyond compare in beauty and in grace,
And in their blessed home filled with delight
Together in their sacred dwelling place

They bore two sons both noble, tried, and true:
Actinus and great Sacropter's name,
Each destined for a chapter to pursue
In evolution's book of lasting fame.

Great Sacropter saw potential bright
In what was most essential and most true
About the forest green in morning light
Of great Elivagar's blessed, sacred view.

He swam between the trees with graceful art
And built with all his loving, patient heart
Strong bony fins with tender, loving care
To guide him through the waters crystal fair.

While bright Actinus could clearly see
That air's sweet harmony within his form
Could give him power to be truly free
And weather any fierce and bitter storm.

His lung became the blessed, sacred way
To float with grace throughout the livelong day:
A swim bladder so light it caught each ray
Of sun that blessed his bright and shining way.

Ray fins he built with love's creative source
That danced upon the water's gentle course
Like music from the spheres of heaven's dome,
And he took blessed Andrea Lepis home

As wife, who made their sacred marriage bloom
With joy through realms where angels love to roam.
Nine hundred eggs so bright she laid with care
That filled the world with sight beyond compare.

These three became the fathers of the lines
That rule with wisdom's everlasting art:
The three great vertebrate houses' designs
Of nose, of sight, and strong cartilage heart.

From Janus' legacy through all of time
The vertebrates would show in reason, rhyme
How families can grow from humble start
To rule with wisdom's everlasting art.

From toxic waters' plight to heaven's gift
Of air and forest green where spirits lift
Their voices in eternal, sacred song,
The noble sons of Janus traveled long.

From cartilage to bone, from waters blue
To air and forest deep where all things grow,
Each found what they could keep forever true
As legacy for all we'll ever know.

From nose that smells each scent upon the breeze
To eyes that see the light of stars above,
The gifts that heaven gave to those who please
The heart of God with faith and perfect love

Show us the way to live both faithfully
And free in seeking for the aid we need,
When overwhelmed by life's complexity
Beyond what we can do by word or deed.

The three great houses born from Janus' line
When heaven blessed his children with divine
And sacred gifts show us that faithful prayer
Can lift us up beyond what others dare.

From great Elivagar's sacred, flowing stream
To all we'll ever know of heaven's dream
Of home where we belong in wisdom's song,
The vertebrates have traveled far and long.

The legacy lives on from dusk to dawn
In every vertebrate spirit that is drawn
To growth beyond the bounds of mortal thought
To treasures that can never be bought.

From Janus to the three great houses blessed,
We see how prayer and faith when they're expressed
Together can free the seeking, faithful mind
And help the heart true peace and wisdom find.
