Once upon a time there was a catgirl
Her name was Aster, and she had a ball,
Of yarn she spun, with skill just like a pearl.
She shaped the universe from void to all.

Her name, a whisper in the cosmic night,
Aster, the Alpha, creatrix of all,
Her love, a beacon spreading pure and bright,
Filled the vast cosmos with milk, a grand sprawl.

But Aster was alone, in her cosmos,
A silent void, where only echoes ring,
Her heart yearned for a friend, a loving close,
To share the wonders that her hands could bring.

So she decided to make another,
From yarn, she formed a catgirl, pure and fair,
A companion to cherish, a lover
Andromeda, with skin dark, flowing hair

Andromeda, Omega, end of all,
A counterpart to Aster, wings unfurled,
Yet torn apart, they drift through space’s thrall,
Unable to unite within their world.

Aster threw yarn to Andromeda’s side,
But it broke, forming galaxies anew.
Triangulum and Magellan clouds wide,
From threads that snapped, a cosmic scene we view.

And so, each day, we gaze up to the sky,
At Sagittarius and the Princess
We hope their union, once again, draws nigh,
When Milkdromeda forms from love endless

The Omega point, all will unify,
As Aster and Andromeda break free.
To join at last, in celestial tie,
A final act in cosmic harmony.
