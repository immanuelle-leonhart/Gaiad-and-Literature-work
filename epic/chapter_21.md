When warming seas replaced the icy death,
And Snowball Earth gave way to liquid blue,
Nectarius drew his first living breath,
And saw his kingdom vast and bright and new.

His four great children, each with destined role,
Would shape the world in ways both strange and grand.
While Planta captured light to feed the soul,
And Mycon's threads would spread across the land.

Fair Protist took the waters as her realm,
A thousand forms within her lineage born.
While bold Metazoa took evolution's helm,
To build the bodies of each coming morn.

But first came Protist, eldest of the four,
Who gazed upon the warming, fertile sea.
"My realm," she said, "shall be from shore to shore,
A kingdom of diversity set free."

She bore her first-born son, brave Choanos fair,
Whose collar caught the smallest bits of food.
With flagellum dancing in the water there,
He founded his colonial brotherhood.

Now Choanos met fair Chana by the strand,
A maiden with a membrane soft and bright.
Together they would build, with joined hand,
A city gleaming golden in the light.

Their son Mebarasi, strong and true,
United four cells in a sacred square.
While daughter Corona, beautiful and new,
Learned silicon's secrets from the air.

Corona wed Silicarius the wise,
A son of retrovirus lineage old.
Their marriage blessed beneath the warming skies,
Would make their children's shells like beaten gold.

From them came Diana, diatom queen,
Whose glassy armor caught the morning light.
And Loricus, the strongest ever seen,
Who built his fortress walls both day and night.

These two, Diana and her brother bold,
United marriage with their silicon art.
Their children's shells were worth their weight in gold,
As beauty and strength played equal part.

Their family stayed together, four as one,
E pluribus unum was their cry.
Beneath the ever-warming, golden sun,
They built great nets to catch fish swimming by.

Their sons would double with each generation,
Eight, sixteen, thirty-two, and then still more.
A geometric, grand multiplication,
As cities spread from sea to distant shore.

When Eudorinus ruled his band of thirty-two,
He saw the need for greater sustenance.
He wed fair Zoe Xanthella, maiden true,
Princess of dinoflagellate expanse.

She brought the art of farming to his clan,
Her golden light could feed them from within.
The first symbiotic husbandman,
Their partnership made plenty from the thin.

As Sexagesmus ruled his larger host,
A bacterial invasion threatened all.
His women rose like shields from coast to coast,
And answered evolution's urgent call.

They cast aside their flagella's graceful dance,
And took the form of warrior-maidens bold.
With pseudopods they fought in battle stance,
While cytoplasm flowed like liquid gold.

These shieldmaidens became the first immune,
Their amoeboid forms would guard and heal.
Beneath the ever-changing, silver moon,
They showed what love and sacrifice could steal.

The mesoderm was born from their brave choice,
While endoderm kept the flagellar way.
Two tissues answered evolution's voice,
Specialization ruled from that bright day.

When Volvox-Choan ruled five hundred strong,
He split his people into ranks of two:
The Germline royalty, to whom belong
The right to reproduce their lineage true.

The Somatic serfs would serve and die,
Their sacrifice would feed the royal line.
Beneath the vast and democratic sky,
Hierarchy was born by love's design.

But Carcinoma, a maiden bold and fierce,
Refused to accept her servant's fate.
Her rebellion's cry would pierce
The perfect order of the city-state.

"Why should the few rule over the many?
Why should I die while others get to live?
Of royal blood I have not any,
But equal worth is what the gods do give!"

Her uprising shook the spherical town,
As somatic cells rebelled as one.
The order that seemed carved in stone fell down,
A revolution underneath the sun.

Volvox-Choan cried to heaven's throne,
"O mighty Mithra, god of bonds and trust!
Have I built this city all alone,
Only to see it crumble into dust?

Is the multicellular dream a lie?
Must every city fall to civil war?
Can unity and order never tie
The many into one forevermore?"

Great Mithra heard his faithful servant's plea,
And sent an answer through the morning air:
"The path to true complexity must be
Built not on dominance, but loving care.

Let specialization find its way
Through cooperation, not through force.
The cells that serve you loyal every day
Deserve their share of honor in due course.

For in the end, when bodies complex grow,
Each cell must play its part with willing heart.
The greatest cities built on love will glow,
While tyranny tears unity apart."

And so the lesson learned in ancient seas
Would echo through the ages yet to come:
True multicellular victories
Are won when many willingly are one.

From Protist's children came the art of form,
Of building bodies from cooperating cells.
Through peace and war, through calm and raging storm,
The tale of specialization swells.

But this is just the first of many songs
Of how complexity from simple grew.
For to Nectarius's line belongs
The gift of making old things into new.

In chapters yet to come, we'll sing the praise
Of Planta's green and photosynthetic art,
Of Mycon's mysterious fungal ways,
And how Metazoa played his vital part.

But for today, let Protist's story rest,
Her children's gift of cooperation.
Through trial and error, failure and success,
She built the base of multicellular creation.
