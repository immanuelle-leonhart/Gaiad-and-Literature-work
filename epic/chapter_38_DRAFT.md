# Chapter 38: The Pentamerous Kingdom (DRAFT)

As sons of Chordatus grew strong and true
With bloodlines flowing wide,
And Annelon's children spread anew
Their segments far and wide,

The sons of Ambulus sought the light
Of greatness they had fought
To win through patient art so bright
And wisdom they had wrought.

While sons of Chordatus learned to swim
With hearts that burned like fire,
The sons of Ambulus found their hymn
In nature's sweet desire.

As one with nature's gentle way,
They fished through night and day.
They started much the same as those
Of Chordatus' noble prose.

But Hemichus, Ambulus' son so dear,
Built his proboscis long
One day to serve his need sincere.
Half-cord would be his song.

His cord was only halfway made,
His brain for nature's sake
Was also partial, never strayed
From paths that he would take.

Thus Hemichordates would stay
Forever in between,
Half-chord throughout each day
In waters blue and green.

Hemichus bore two sons so bright:
When dawn broke came sweet Acorn,
And Oak his brother, strong in might,
Who lived since he was born.

Acorn lived as ocean worm
Through every season's turn.
But Oak lived like a tree so firm,
His roots would always yearn.

Oak bore two sons in time's flow:
Biscarpon, strong and prime,
And Pterobronk, his twin, would grow
Through every age and time.

Pterobronk became the father
Of forms that would aspire
To heights in ocean's sacred water:
Graptolites caught his fire,

And Pterobranches too he made,
Colonial and true and bright.
Like trees beneath the ocean's shade
They lived in pure delight.

Biscarpon built with greatest care
A skeleton to wear,
Of limestone white beyond compare
To armor him with prayer.

Biscarpon bore two children more:
Ctenocyston explored
The seafloor's dark and mystic shore,
While Cincton was adored

For gill slits pumping strong and well
Through his armored shell so bright.
The water flowed through him to tell
Of fish caught in his sight.

While Ctenocyston crawled with grace
Where ocean's floor held sway,
Cincton pumped and fished his place
For prey throughout the day.

Protected by his mail so strong
His fishing would not fail.
Through gill slits water flowed along
To catch fish small and frail.

Cincton begat Soluton bright,
A strange and bold one, true.
One arm he stretched with all his might
With tubes that ever grew

Inflatable and long and strong
To make his fishing great.
His left side ruled throughout his song
While right side met its fate.

His right side shriveled small and weak
While left ruled over all.
Asymmetry began to speak
That bright and fateful call.

Soluton begat with pride
Helicoplacus, who grew
With arms that multiplied by three
On every side he knew.

No bilateral form could bear
To weather this great storm
Of change that swept through everywhere—
Triradial became his form.

He took upon his frame with care
A shape without a name
That none had ever seen compare
In all time's ancient game.

Helicoplacus took the shape
That let his lineage flee
From ancient symmetry's drape
To new geometry.

Helicoplacus wed with love
Fair Adria-Esther bright,
Led by the stars above
To sing their song of light.

Together they built low and small
A city's five-fold glow
Upon the rocks beneath it all
Where ocean currents flow.

Pentus was their son so dear
When all their work was done.
Five-sided through each year
His form shone like the sun.

The sons of Pentus grew in might
Both numerous and true.
Great numbers brought them light
With pentamerous view.

Pentus begat Stromatos bold,
Who built like strength divine
His power five-fold
Through every storm's design.

Stromatos begat Lepidos wise,
Who chose like Soluton bright
To stretch his arms toward the skies
Along the ocean's height.

Ambulacra arms he made
In water's bright parade.
These arms would pump and flow
With life from head to toe.

Lepidos begat Felbabka strong,
Who built his strange creation
Of plates arranged lifelong
In patterns through each nation.

Felbabka begat Echidna fair,
The stalked one, quite a sight
With spiny skin beyond compare
That glowed with inner light.

Echidna was the mother true
Of children beyond measure:
The great Echinoderms grew
To be the ocean's treasure.

Her daughters were sea lilies bright
That bloomed like water flowers
And ruled the seas with graceful might
Through all the passing hours.

Invulnerable to attack so fierce
Their cities bore no lack
Of beauty none could ever pierce—
A sight that brought no lack.

Floating cities they built high
Without the least of guilt
Upon the ocean floor to lie
Like gardens ever-built.

Their mighty cities were by far
The greatest ever known
In all time near and far
When ocean held the throne.

Today we see but ruins sad
And lonely of their home
That once made ocean's heart glad
Beneath the silver foam.

But in the days of ancient time
They ruled with graceful art
The seas in their sublime
And ever-beating heart.

From half-cord Hemichus bright
To great Echidna's fame
The line of Ambulus' sight
Grew glorious in name.

The hemichordates showed with care
How nature's garden flowed
From simple start everywhere
To complex art bestowed.

The graptolites and more
Pterobranches found their way
To colonial shore
In waters night and day.

The early echinoderms learned
Through all their passing years
That symmetry could be turned
Through evolution's tears.

From bilateral design so true
To triradial line complete
To five-fold form anew—
No other has this feat.

The sons of Ambulus found their light
Not through swimming fast and free
But through forms that shine bright
Through all eternity.

Their calcium carbonate strong
Made them fortunate indeed
With armor lifelong
To serve their every need

Through trials of the rolling sea
And every storm that came.
Their spiny skin would be
The glory of their name.

In every starfish arm that moves
Without a trace of fear,
In every sea urchin that proves
Pentamerous design so dear,

In every sea lily's grace
That held the ancient throne
Of ruler in the deep sea's space
Where ocean's secrets are known,

Remember Ambulus' line so true
And how their design became
The five-fold way they knew
That bears eternal fame.

The sons of Ambulus were blessed
Not with swimming might and speed
Like Chordatus' quest
And his noble creed.

But in their patient art so fine
Of living day by day
With nature's sweet design
They found their destined way.

Their fishing was their sacred gift,
Through ocean's every tide
They learned through every drift
To be nature's guide.

And so from humble start so small
They learned great nature's art
Of living through it all
In harmony of heart.

From Hemichus the half-made bright
To Echidna's command
Of all echinoderm sight,
The line of thoughtful mind

Found its way to shine
In pentamerous design complete.
Five-fold symmetry divine
Through time's eternal beat.

The ancient cities fell at last
But still their stories tell
Of how the patient path
Can serve the ocean well.

In gardens of the deep blue sea
They lived with graceful art.
Their floating cities free
Were wonder to the heart.

Though now in ruins they lie
Their glory will not fade.
The five-fold legacy
Through time will be displayed.
