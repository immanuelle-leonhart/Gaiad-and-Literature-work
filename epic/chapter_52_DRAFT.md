# Chapter 52: The Jaw Revolution (DRAFT)

Great Vater was the son of noble fame
In tenth generation of Pteraspis' line,
Ancestor of humanity's great name
And myriad species by divine design.

His innovation would forever change
The world for good throughout eternity,
He built a channel grand beyond the range
Of what had been seen in antiquity.

Uniting liver bright and pancreas
Into his belly's space with skillful art,
To this day we trace what none could surpass:
"Ampulla of Vater" plays its part.

Such an exalted father beyond measure,
The Elohim called him Abraham true,
For one whose progeny would be their treasure
And fill eternity's eternal view.

Great Vater bore two sons of different mind:
Brave Arandus when the day begun,
And wise Hestracon, who was inclined
To carry on what his father had done.

Hestracon found his belly inadequate
For the great work he knew he'd have to do,
From mouth to anus all was simple fateâ€”
Only his father's gift would see him through.

His father's ampulla in the middle
Could solve digestion's ancient, vexing riddle,
But this was not enough for one so strong
As Hestracon, who'd right what had been wrong.

Hestracon built with care a chamber new
Before his father's gift to give it lift,
He called it his stomach, and this would be true
As the great divider, nature's gift.

Between the provider of food from above
And what intestines' care would process below,
The esophagus carried with gentle love
The food that made the body grow.

After the stomach lay intestine long,
Well-played in its appointed sacred role
To nourish the whole with purpose strong
And feed each part to make complete the whole.

Hestracon begat two sons of fame:
Bold Astrops, tried and true in every way,
And strong Eteros, who'd win his name
Through faithful service every blessed day.

Eteros begat two sons of might:
Bright Cyatha with his cup-shield strong,
And wise Tsubasa, wing-shielded sight
Who dared to face what others thought was wrong.

From Tsubasa came two sons of worth:
Great Thelos, tried and true in innovation,
And wise Cephalus, who'd prove his birth
Through wisdom's penetrating contemplation.

Bold Thelos broke his armor into scales,
No former rigidity would bind
His innovative mind that never fails
To seek solutions others couldn't find.

Into innumerable scales so bright
His armor gave him flexibility
And great ability to live in sight
Of reefs with their complexity.

Where none others could bend enough to reach
The coral's tight embrace and hidden food,
Great Thelos found his place within each
Niche where others never could.

Neither sons of Arthropus so strong
Nor sons of Molluscus could ever match
His status where he lived his whole life long
In spaces tight that others couldn't catch.

While brave Cephalus bore wings bright and fair
On each side of his helmet's noble form,
His head flew as he swam through water's care
With grace through calm and every raging storm.

His lateral line would keep him always aware
Of all that might befall his swimming way,
He sensed around his form with greatest care
And weathered every storm both night and day.

Cephalus begat two sons of fame:
Great Galeas, tried and true in might,
And wise Osteos, who'd win his name
Through innovation's penetrating sight.

Osteos saw his bones were not quite right
For efficiency, he knew they had to change,
His bones were expensive, wasting in sight
Countless resources far beyond their range.

Through phosphorus and calcium by the score,
Elements that could be better used
If they were not abused by static store
That stood there lifeless, never being used.

So he decided he would build with care
More cleverly his skeleton anew,
Blood channels flowing everywhere
With wisdom tried and true.

Inside his bones, making living, breathing stores
Of minerals that worked like generals wise,
In abundance building up their scores
From nature's cup that never dies.

And in scarcity he'd borrow what he'd saved
From treasures stored in times of plenty,
And so he grew more strong and well-behaved
Than relatives whose stores were empty.

Osteos bore two sons of different way:
Great Pituri when the dawn begun,
And wise Ostracos, whose children would display
Their forms beneath the blazing sun.

Ostracos bore a host from coast to coast,
A million sons who'd spread where they were led
By life's eternal call to every post
Where future generations would be fed.

But Pituri grew a snout so long
Beyond all doubt the longest ever seen,
His mouth was made of lips but never strong
Enough for jaws within evolution's scene.

Could only close the space but never bite
His prey with crushing, devastating might,
But Pituri begat wise Beakon true
Who saw what innovation's art could do.

And so brave Beakon moved his gill arches bright
Into his mouth and fought for food each day
In ways that worked both morning and night
With innovation's revolutionary way.

Beakon's son named Gnathus saw the need
And with his wife Pelaca hunted well,
They didn't just catch prey with simple speed
But crushed them with their jaws beyond all tell.

They hunted trilobites with mighty power
And brought them to innovation's flame,
They sliced through every meal each blessed hour
With jaws that won eternal fame.

And so the jaws were born on that great day
When Gnathus and Pelaca showed their might,
The power to break through in every way
What none before could bring to sight.

The secret of the jaw that follows law
Much newer than what came before,
The world would never be the same we saw
From that day forth forevermore.

When jaws became the newer laws of might
That brought predatory revolution new,
A different world was brought to sight
In all that life could ever do.

From Vater's ampulla's sacred gift
To Gnathus' crushing jaws so bright,
The vertebrates show how spirits lift
When innovation burns with light.

To never be content with fate alone
But always strive to be much more
Alive and capable, full-grown
Throughout life's everlasting shore.

From Hestracon's stomach chamber new
To Osteos' bones with channels through,
From Thelos' scales so bright and true
To Cephalus' stabilizing view,

The vertebrates remind us that the mind
That breaks from what is merely known
Can reap the harvest it has sowed and find
New heights beyond what it had grown.

From simple mouth that only closed its space
To jaw that crushed with devastating might,
The story shows us innovation's grace
Can turn our darkness into light.

Small changes grow into the flowing stream
Of evolution's endless, sacred way,
Where nothing's ever quite what they seem
But everything can change from day to day.

The jaws that Gnathus made will never fade
From vertebrate design so fine,
Protection from the world's hard ways well-made
Throughout our days by power divine.

From Vater's family tree so bright and true
To jaws that set the future free
From limitations old that once we knew,
The vertebrates show what we can be:

The masters of our fate through wisdom's art
That never ceases in its sacred climb,
Innovation playing its vital part
In evolution's endless, sacred rhyme.
