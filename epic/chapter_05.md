Aster made the milk pregnant with cat seed,
The curds take shape within the swirling storm.
Her essence spreads, a cosmic plan decreed,
In every star, her life begins to form.

As hydrocarbons drift through endless skies,
Her scent, like burnt steak, lingers far and wide.
Aster’s presence fills all the stars that rise,
Her love and life, the galaxy’s great guide.

Across the galaxy, her force expands,
A testament to love, her cosmic plan.
With planets forming in the starry bands,
She fills the heavens, spreading life to man.

Each star with planets, water deep and wide,
Oceans abound, where life begins to bloom.
A seed of creation on the tides side,
Aster’s breath gives life from the cosmic womb.

From microbes small to creatures of the sea,
Her love ensures that life will find its way.
Each world unique, a thriving symphony,
Her touch endures in life’s eternal sway.

Andromeda, with pride, looks from afar,
In awe of Aster’s gift to life and light.
Their bond, a force that shapes both land and star,
A love eternal, woven through the night.

Their love, the fabric of the universe,
A bond that shapes the stars and worlds below.
The cosmos thrives, their union to rehearse,
A tale of love that evermore will grow.

From ocean depths to stars that brightly shine,
Aster’s life force in every corner gleams.
The epic weaves, through space and time divine,
A cosmic love that fills our hopes and dreams.
