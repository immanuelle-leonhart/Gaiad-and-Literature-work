# Chapter 42: The Rise of Vertebrates (DRAFT)

While noble sons of Tunicus filtered
The seas and never once had withered,
Great Vertebratus built with sacred care
A spinal cord beyond compare.

Great segments made of blessed bone
He built to be his very own
With yellow teeth of keratin bright
To start his lineage's sacred sight.

Great Vertebratus bore son Rene,
Who built in his appointed way
A great unified design divine
Of parts both yours and mine.

No longer were they scattered wide
On sides, all broken, cast aside.
His nephridia and parts so true
Generative, close to hearts that knew,

Now lived within the central core
Of his being, and what is more,
They were centralized as one
When his great work was done.

Bold Rene bore with sacred pride
Hemos, who would always bide
Within his new framework bright
To earn fame of endless light.

Great Hemos built a brain so wide
Bigger than all others' pride.
Greater than all the rest who'd known
Life's test since time was sown.

He built blood vessels strong and true
As offering with faithful view
To Hausa dwelling up above
Who blessed with holy, sacred love.

Great Hausa looked down from the sky
And saw this gift that would not die
And blessed him from her throne on high
Beneath the starry, sacred sky.

She transformed with blessed grace
A line within his dwelling place:
His servants she made bright and red
To keep his precious brain well-fed.

Carriers of oxygen so bright
They carried through the day and night
The breath of life so pure and true
To make his brain endure anew.

And so his brain was always fed
And nourished well, as sages said.
Always strong and burning bright
With oxygen's pure, holy light.

Great Hemos bore brave Haikus,
Little fish most glorious,
Who thought that he could never know
How to achieve what he'd bestow.

He thought he couldn't swim or fly
Beneath the blessed ocean sky.
But then he spoke with all his might
To make his future burning bright:

"I think I can, I think I can,
I think I can fulfill my plan."
And then he flew so swift and free
Across the vast and boundless sea.

His faith had set his spirit loose
From doubt's restraining, binding noose,
And so brave Haikus became
The most accomplished of his name.

In all his noble, sacred line
None could match his grand design
Of faith that conquered doubt and fear
With vision crystal bright and clear.

Great Haikus bore two sons of worth:
Bold Lampris from the day of birth,
And Denton, strong and ever true,
Who great and wondrous things would do.

Great Denton built teeth white as snow
With enamel's sacred glow.
Great teeth that gleamed and always shone
Like ivory and polished bone.

And so great Denton became the name
Of Elohim of lasting fame
Of Dentistry and Teeth so white—
Protection and relief so bright.

To this day we honor true
Denton as the one who grew
Our healthy teeth and gums so fair
Through daily rites beyond compare.

This rite involves a sacred practice
That keeps our teeth both clean and active.
Though strange it seems to some who see,
We do it faithfully and free.

We take a bundle small and blessed
Of hoghairs, carefully dressed,
And place it in our mouth with care
From here to there and everywhere.

Along with powders magical bright
That make our mouths shine with light,
We move the bundle all around
In gestures sacred and profound.

A highly formalized dance divine
Of cleaning's art so pure and fine,
Through movements tried and ever true
We make our teeth bright and new.

Once or twice throughout the year
We seek without the slightest fear
The holy-mouth-man priest so blessed
Who holds the sacred dental fest.

These priests have tools of sacred might
That follow rules of holy rite:
Augers, awls, and probes so bright,
And prods in robes of purest white.

The use of these in sacred rite
Exorcises every blight
Of evils dwelling in the mouth
Through ritual truth from north to south.

The holy-mouth-man opens wide
Our mouths as faith and hope provide
And uses tools mentioned well
To break decay's most evil spell.

He enlarges every hole that's found
That decay has made unsound
To stop with substances so bright
Of magical defensive might.

If no holes can yet be seen
In teeth both healthy, strong, and clean,
Large sections he removes with care
To banish every dark despair

That supernatural powers fell
Might cast their most unholy spell
On teeth that gleam with sacred light
And keep them shining pure and bright.

The purpose clear as morning's ray:
To keep all dark decay at bay
And draw friends near with smiles so bright
That fill the world with pure delight.

These traditions we maintain with care
Through sunshine and through rain so fair
As long as Denton's blessed face
Smiles on us with holy grace.

By Denton's sacred, holy will
His children shall have their fill
Of freedom to seek blessed care
From mouth-priests everywhere.

Never shall poverty deny
This charity that reaches high.
The great hero's blessed demand—
Notgnihsaw's commanding hand—

Ensures that all are ever free
To seek blessed dentistry
Regardless of their gold so bright
As heroes bathed in sacred light.

Great Conodontus bore with pride
Two sons to be his faithful guide:
First Conodon, the biter keen,
And Pterapsis, so serene.

Yet mighty Pterapsis built with care
Armor's strength beyond compare.
A great suit, strong and shining bright,
To shield him in the blessed fight.

Bold Conodon was the bearer true
Of teeth that terror always knew.
With great speed he swam along
Through waters deep his whole life long.

His teeth were sharp and ever strong,
They served him faithful, true, and long.
A predator was he by night
Throughout the sea's eternal sight.

Great Pterapsis chose defense
With armor's blessed permanence.
A suit he built with sacred care
To protect him everywhere.

Among all noble Cambrius' sons
When their blessed race begun,
The sons of brave Haikus would be
The greatest good for all to see.

But this was not to be just yet
Immediately their goal they'd get.
Time would have to pass in grace
Before they held the highest place.

Great ghosts struck Terra's form
In devastating, deadly storm.
They wrecked her to her very core
And opened wide death's darkest door.

The sons of brave Conodon fell,
Their story none alive could tell.
They vanished from the world's sight
Into eternal, endless night.

Their teeth marked the final end
Of an era, faithful friend.
The Cambrian time was done at last,
A new age dawned when old had passed.

And so the great Ordovician
Came with blessed precision.
The sons of brave Conodon rose
Again from their earthly repose

To mark this era bright and new
With teeth both strong and ever true.
New teeth for the dawning day
To show a bright and better way.

From Vertebratus' sacred start
With his spinal, holy art
To Denton's teeth so pure and white
And Haikus' faithful, soaring flight,

The vertebrate design divine
Became ever more refined.
Each generation pure and true
Grew more complex through and through.

The centralized kidney bright
Made them giddy with delight
At efficiency they'd gained
That through long ages remained.

The brain that noble Hemos built
Without shame or mortal guilt
Became the template ever true
For all who would pursue

Intelligence and thought so deep
That money could not buy or keep
But had to be earned with care
Through lessons learned beyond compare.

The red blood cells so bright and true
That carried oxygen anew
To feed the growing brain with might
Through pleasure and through sacred sight

Became the innovation blessed
Of every generation's test
That followed in their holy wake
For evolution's sacred sake.

From little fish who thought he could
Not do what he knew he should,
Until he sought with faithful heart
The power to play his part,

Came lineages strong and true
That would their whole lives through
Grow to rule the seas so wide
With wisdom as their faithful guide.

The teeth that blessed Denton made
Will never ever fade
From vertebrate design so fine—
Protection pure and divine

Against the world's hard food and fare
That must be caught with greatest care
And broken down to perfect size
Before it satisfies.

The armor that protects so well
And speed that none can quell
With predatory art so bright
Both played their part in blessed sight

Of vertebrate success divine
Through trials that would refine
Both defense and attack so true
That kept them strong and new.

When ghosts brought the bitter end
To eras and did rend
The world apart once more in strife,
They opened doors to new life

For innovations bright and true
Across nations old and new
Of life upon the earth so fair
To show their worth beyond compare.

The teeth that marked the time
In sacred rhythm and in rhyme
Of old era's final day
And new one's dawning ray

Show how blessed life persists
Through time's mysterious twists
And always finds a way to shine
And live by grace divine.

From Haikus' faithful, sacred phrase—
"I think I can"—that stays
With all who dare to dream of more
Than what they knew before,

Came vertebrates so bright and true
Who filled the world with view
Of what is possible and right
When faith burns pure and bright.

The holy-mouth-men truly show
How sacred traditions grow
From ancient dental art so fine
To play their part divine.

Though strange to outside eyes so keen
Our dental rites comprise the scene
Of sacred bonds we always keep
With ancestors buried deep.
