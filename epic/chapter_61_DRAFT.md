# Chapter 61: The Land Bridge - DRAFT (Proper Iambic Pentameter)

When great destruction claimed its due,
One hero brave and ever true
Survived the darkness of that day—
Rhipidistius led the way.

Through trials deep and waters dark,
He kept alive hope's sacred spark
And never lost his faith complete
Beyond his mortal life so fleet.

Rhipidistius the great and strong
Bore two sons who lived lifelong
In wisdom: brave Dipnos so true,
And mighty Tetram, through and through.

Dipnos became the noble sire
Of those whose hearts would never tire
Of breathing air when waters fail:
The lungfish tell their wondrous tale.

They live a double life with care,
Both in the water and the air,
With all their strength and loving might
For water's flow and air's sweet light.

When drought would steal the streams away
Where lungfish loved to swim and play,
They could survive by breathing free
The air through all eternity.

Until the rains would bring once more
The waters to each distant shore
With life-sustaining, blessed flood
That stirred their brave and faithful blood.

But Tetram chose a different way:
He changed his gut from day to day
In linear form, and this would let
Him eat large fish without regret.

All fish possess four nostrils clear:
Two let the water enter here
For breath so deep and pure and true,
Two let it flow back out anew.

Back out to rivers running wide
Where currents are the faithful guide
For life beneath the rolling waves
In dark and mysterious caves.

Young Tetram followed this design—
His nostrils came in number nine—
But Tetram breathed not through the four
That others used in days of yore.

He breathed instead through ears so bright
To fill his world with precious sight
Of possibilities unknown
To those who'd never grown

Beyond what others chose to do
In ways both ancient and true,
But dared to try a different way
To live from night to dawning day.

He breathed air through his ear's sweet call—
His otic notches heard it all
And brought the air into his frame
And gave him a most noble name.

The power to transcend the small
And heed a greater, higher call
Than limits placed on mortal dreams
By what reality just seems

To offer those who dare to try
New ways to touch the starry sky
Of possibility so bright
Through everlasting, endless night.

But breathing through his ears brought tears,
For it made weak his power to hears
The sounds around him, and his guard
Of hearing became truly hard.

This weakened choice meant he would pay
A price for his innovative way:
The channels made for hearing sound
Now let the air come flowing down.

When Tetram's work on earth was done,
He left behind a noble son:
Kenichthus, strong in every way,
Who'd lead his lineage each day.

Kenichthus bore two children then,
Two sons beyond the race of men:
Tetracan and brave Rhizodon,
Each with their own work begun.

Tetracan bore two sons as well:
Great Tetramegas, strong to tell
His lineage, and Canowin's fate
Would make their bloodline truly great.

From Tetramegas came two more:
Eotetras set to explore
The world, and brave Megalichthys,
Whose strength would never go amiss.

Eotetras bore children bright:
Tintetra of the clearest sight,
And brave Tristichopterus too,
Whose name would rise to fame so true.

From Tintetra's noble line
Came Platelpis, strong and fine,
And faithful Tinirau as well,
Each with their own tale to tell.

Platelpis bore two sons with care:
Young Elpis, noble, strong, and fair,
And brave Platycephalus strong,
Who served his lineage lifelong.

This last one built a skull so strong—
A bite that lasted his lifelong—
So powerful his jaws could break
Through anything, for honor's sake.

No force could stop his teeth so bright
From crushing with their mighty might,
His powerful jaws would break with ease
Through stone and bone and mighty trees.

But Elpis wandered far and wide
Beneath each star, his faithful guide,
Across the swamplands, wet and deep,
Where ancient secrets always keep

Their vigil through the passing years
Despite all mortal joys and fears,
Through marshes dark and waters still
According to his noble will.

He searched the entire world around
Where mysteries could be found
In every secret, hidden place
With beauty, wonder, and with grace.

Elpis bore a son so brave
Who'd rise above each rolling wave
Of ordinary life and strife:
Panderichthys throughout his life.

This noble son would search for long
Throughout the earth for wisdom's song
Of love's eternal, gentle call
That echoes sweetly over all

The world with sound both true and clear,
Where faithful love casts out all fear
By those who never cease to seek
The peace for which all spirits speak.

And he found love both true and deep
In Stega, whom he'd always keep
Close to his heart—a maiden fair
Whose beauty filled the earth and air.

He married her with joy complete
That nothing could ever defeat,
And together they would raise
A son through all their earthly days.

They named their son with loving care:
Tiktaalik the strong and fair—
A name that would be known and blessed
As greater than an earthly crest.

Of power or dominion's might
Could give to those who seek the light
For more than what they seem to be
In evolution's grand decree.

Tiktaalik the great and strong
Was destined for a path lifelong
Of walking on the solid land
Built by the Almighty's hand.

From ocean's deep and distant shore
To find his way to something more
Than water's ancient, flowing past—
To solid ground that would last.

To land both green and fresh and wide
Where he could walk with noble pride
In air's sweet freedom, pure and bright,
Through every day and every night.

Tiktaalik bore a noble son:
When Elgin's work on earth was done,
Upon the throne of those who chose
To conquer every one of those

Limitations from the past
That made their ancestors held fast
In bonds they thought could never break—
But Elgin fought for freedom's sake.

From Elgin came another heir:
Young Ventastega, strong and fair,
Who'd carry on the noble line
Of destiny both pure and fine.

From Ventastega's lineage came
Acanthostega of great fame—
A leader strong in every way
Who'd guide his people every day.

Acanthostega bore a son:
When Ichthyostega's work begun,
He'd change the way that life would live
And everything that life could give.

For Ichthyostega made the choice
To change his breathing's inner voice:
He stopped the breathing through his ears
That caused such pain throughout his years.

Of hearing loss and daily pain
Through sunshine and through heavy rain,
And started breathing clear and true
Through nostrils made for me and you.

He joined them with his mouth with care
So that the life-sustaining air
Could flow in cleaner, purer streams
And help fulfill his noblest dreams

Of hearing every sound around
With clarity both sweet and sound,
And smelling every precious scent
That nature's hand had ever sent.

Upon the gentle morning breeze
That flows through forests and through trees
Where life in forms beyond all count
Survives time's every fierce amount.

Of change and evolution's call
With beauty standing over all
And wisdom in their faithful hearts
That plays the very noblest parts.

And so he could hear crystal clear
Each whisper drawing ever near
And every song that broke the night
When dawn returned with golden light.

That brings the world to life again
And helps all creatures, beasts, and men
To thrive and grow in wisdom's ways
Throughout their long and faithful days.

And smell he could whenever he
Desired his senses to be free
To know what scents would tell him well
The stories that they had to tell.

Of all that lived in regions round
His home on firm and solid ground
Where air was fresh and pure and clean,
The sweetest that was ever seen.

Ichthyostega bore a son:
When Watcher's youth was finally done,
He built no gills despite the call
Of water's voice that beckoned all.

For Watcher needed none at all—
When he had grown beyond the small
Estate of youth, he lived instead
On land where he was daily fed.

Built by the faithful, loving hand
Of those who came to claim this land
And open up the door so wide
Of hope for every countryside.

As child he'd play in waters clear
And bright throughout the passing year,
But when he came to manhood's stage
He turned to a different page.

In evolution's sacred book
For those who dare to take a look
At what can be achieved with care
When hearts and minds combine to dare.

He lived on land so green and bright,
The greatest and most lovely sight,
And breathed the air both fresh and free
Throughout all of eternity.

Young Watcher bore two sons with love
And raised them by the grace above
In ponds of water, crystal clear,
Where they would grow throughout each year.

Crassigyrinus and Tetrapod,
Both blessed by the Almighty God,
Both filled his world with hope and light
Of what they'd grow to in his sight.

Crassigyrinus made the choice
To follow ocean's ancient voice
And went back to the salty sea—
A path that always seems to be

Repeated through the ages long
In evolution's eternal song
By children dear who hear the call
Of waters that once held them all.

Calling them back to their home
In waters where their kin would roam
Like all their fathers from the past
Who swam the oceans deep and vast.

Before the land was ever found
Where they could stand on solid ground
And breathe the air both fresh and free
Throughout all of eternity.

A noble custom, true and proud,
That many children have avowed
When life upon the land became
More difficult than ocean's claim.

And they would hear the gentle call
Of water's voices over all
That sang of ancient, peaceful days
And old familiar, loving ways.

But Tetrapod became instead
The father, as the wise have said,
Of many who would choose to stay
Upon the land throughout each day.

With two legs or perhaps with four,
Or sometimes using even more
Than what they'd need to crawl around
Upon the firm and solid ground.

Of earth beneath their loyal feet
That made their humble lives complete
In ways the sea could never do
For hearts both faithful, strong, and true.

That always had their hopes and dreams
Set on the land and mountain streams
Where they could build their cities bright
Throughout each day and every night.

He became the noble sire
Of nations whose sole desire
Was living in the air so free
Throughout all of eternity.

Rather than return again
To seas where their ancient kin
Had lived for ages long and true
But now sang different songs anew.

From brave Rhipidistius' survival
To evolution's great arrival
At the threshold of the land
Built by the Almighty's hand,

The vertebrates show us the way
That hope can live from day to day
Of growth beyond what seems so small
To answer a much greater call.

Of what they all could yet become
When they refuse to be struck numb
To possibilities so bright
That none can see but those who fight

For dreams of more than what they seem
In evolution's noble scheme
And work with all their heart and might
To reach toward the source of light.

Of freedom in the air so clear
Where they can build without a fear
A world where all can truly thrive
And feel completely, fully alive.

From lungfish breathing both ways true
To Watcher's life on land anew,
The story shows the path that leads
From ancient to modern needs.

New ways to overcome the small
That makes the weary spirit fall
To wonder and to hope so bright
Beyond our mortal, earthly sight.

From breathing through the ears so clear
To hearing without any fear
The whispers of the gentle wind
That help the heart to rescind

All limits on what might be true
For every me and every you
Who trace our lineage back with care
To those who breathed the ancient air.

Through every trial and every test
That challenged them to do their best,
Their own expectations of the days
That lay ahead in unknown ways.

From Tetram's linear design
To great Tiktaalik's bloodline
Upon the land both green and wide,
Each change became their faithful guide.

To wisdom gleaned from all around
Where possibilities are found
In every choice that they would make
And every risk that they would take.

For growth beyond the small estate
Of those who simply trust in fate
To hear the call of something more
Of what they had not known before.

Of what they all were meant to be
When they would choose to live truly free
In power of the light so bright
To conquer every endless night.

And lift them up to clearly see
What they were meant to be.

The great landwalkers' noble line
Shows destiny both pure and fine
That leads from sea to solid shore
And then to something so much more:

A life of freedom, pure and bright,
In air and golden morning light
Where dreams can all come true
For me and you.

From brave Panderichthys' quest
To love's eternal, holy rest
Where he and Stega found their joy
That nothing could ever destroy,

The vertebrates remind us all
That hearts that hear the greater call
And minds that will not be content
With what seems merely Heaven-sent

Will find what suits them best and true
In partnership to see them through
The trials that mark the way they go
From night to day's eternal glow.

Of possibility so bright
Throughout the everlasting night
Where all who dare to dream and see
Find more than what they seem to be.

From water's ancient, flowing home
To land where they could freely roam
In freedom's sweet and pure embrace
With beauty, wonder, love, and grace,

The landwalkers prepared the way
For all who dare to seize the day
To leave behind the ancient past
And make the good things always last.

In cities built with loving care
Upon the land so green and fair
Where all who seek to grow and thrive
Will find the way to stay alive

In love's eternal, sacred power
To bless each sweet and precious hour
With gifts that help us grow to be
More than we seem to be.

The legacy lives on today
From dusk until the break of day
In every breath that we may take
And every choice that we will make

To grow beyond the small and weak
And find the greater good we seek
Of what we can become in time
When we are partners in love's rhyme.

To wonder all around us here
On air and solid ground so dear
That fills the world with golden light
Throughout each day and every night.

From brave Rhipidistius' great deed
To Tetrapod's eternal seed
Of building nations strong and new
With vision clear and ever true,

The vertebrates have always shown
How far our race has ever grown
From simple start in waters deep
To all we'll ever know and keep

Of freedom in the air so clear
Where hearts and minds can persevere
To dream of what can always be
When souls are truly, fully free

To reach beyond the starry sky
Where dreams will never, ever die
But live forever and a day
From mountain peak to distant bay.

In every heart that ever beats
With love that never, ever retreats
From what is right and good and true
For me and you.
