As sons of Devon grew
In might both strong and true,
The spineless sons of bright
Proteus prepared to fight.

In Devon's shadow they
Grew stronger every day,
Building themselves up
To drink from victory's cup.

Among great Spiralius' sons,
Neo, when day begun
In tenth generation's line
Of Bactridius divine,

Was smartest soul on earth—
Intelligence of worth
Beyond what others knew
Or ever could pursue.

Alas, what he possessed
In brilliance, he was blessed
Yet lacked in wisdom's art
That guides the faithful heart.

He rejected all his kin
And ancestors therein,
Refused to learn from those
Who faced similar woes.

And so he and his seed
Were cursed indeed
To always reinvent
What ancestors had sent

As lessons learned through pain
And suffering's refrain.
The wheel they'd build anew
And make mistakes anew.

Neo bore two sons:
Ammon when day begun
And Coleos the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

Both reinvented too
What others always knew—
The wheel of wisdom's lore
That came from those before.

Coleos wrapped his shell
Within his mantle's spell,
And through that innovation
His shell's fortification

Grew stronger than before
From mountain peak to shore.
His protection was complete
From tail unto his feet.

Ammon grew a shell
Coiled compact, and would dwell
Wherever his heart led
With freedom overhead.

He swam where he wished
Through waters that were fished
By others, but he'd roam
And make the sea his home.

Among the sons of might
Ectus, burning bright,
Malacus begat three:
Caridus of the sea,

And Phyllos, strong and true,
And Hoplos, through and through
A warrior in his heart
Who'd play the fighting part.

Caridus begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
Syn Peras and Yuval,
Both answering the call

Of destiny and fate
To make their lineage great
Throughout the world so wide
With ocean as their guide.

Peras bore children many:
Amphipus, not any
Could match, and Isopus too,
And others, tried and true.

His wife, fair Possa, carried
Them all, and never tarried
In nourishing their growth
According to her oath

Of motherhood so pure
That would forever endure
Throughout the years to come
When battles would be done.

Within her pouch they grew
Strong and healthy too,
Fed by her loving care
Beyond all compare.

Yuval bore two sons:
Decapus when begun
The day, and Krillon small
Who answered ocean's call.

Krillon stayed small in size
And swam beneath the skies
Of ocean all his days
In his aquatic ways.

But Decapus grew large
And took his own charge
By sinking to the floor
Of ocean's deepest store.

And so crustaceans would
Be ruled, as well they should,
By three great houses strong
That would last life long:

Amphipods from the line
Of Amphipus divine,
Isopods from the race
Of Isopus in his place,

And Decapods who came
From Decapus' great name—
The three great cladoplasts
Whose glory ever lasts.

Decapus begat two:
Pleos, tried and true,
And Prawnmegas the great
Who'd seal his lineage fate.

Prawnmegas became
Ancestor of the name
Of prawns throughout the sea
In their community.

An unfortunate son
Of Prawnmegas, begun
In sorrow and in shame,
Still bears his father's name.

Pleos begat two more:
Repton to explore
And Shrimpon, who would be
Father by the sea.

Shrimpon became the sire
Of shrimp whose desire
Was boxing and much more
From mountain peak to shore.

Repton begat in time
Two sons in their prime:
Thalasson of the mud
And Omar, whose blood

Would flow through lobster veins
Throughout their life's refrains.
Omar became the father
Of those who'd rather

Live as lobsters bold
And crayfish, stories told
Of their mighty claws
And their ancient laws.

Thalasson became
The father of the name
Of mud shrimp, who would build
What none before had willed:

Great channels carved in stone
That they could call their own,
Cities beneath the sea
For all eternity.

To this day we honor
Their works as donor
Of beauty to the world:
Their cities, unfurled

In fossilized remains
Tell stories and refrains
Of Thallasintep great
And others, sealed by fate

In stone for us to see
Their architecture free
From time's destructive hand
Throughout the ocean land.

Meiuron, son in line
Of tenth generation fine
Of Thalasson, rejected
What fathers had directed.

And so he chose to go
From depths that lay below
To live upon the face
Of ocean's bright embrace.

Meiuron bore two sons:
Anomuron begun
In quiet, and his brother
Saraton, like no other

In vanity and pride
That he could never hide
From those who saw his ways
Throughout his living days.

Saraton was agile
Yet vain, and his fragile
Ego needed always
Praise throughout his days.

And so he constantly
Promoted, you see,
His body as the best
Above all the rest.

His propaganda showed
Where his heart had strowed
Its seed of pride and shame
That blackened his good name.

The sons of Anomuron
Would live when day begun
Quietly as they could
In their small neighborhood.

As squat lobsters they'd dwell
And stories they would tell
Of humble, simple ways
Throughout their living days.

This would change in time
When ten generations' rhyme
Had passed, and they would find
A different state of mind.

Paguros was a son
Of Anomuron, begun
With shell both weak and soft
That others laughed aloft.

In his dying breath
Before he met his death,
The Ammonite Menses
Gave what dispenses

Protection from the world:
His shell, tightly curled,
To Paguros in need
Of this most generous deed.

And so Paguros became
The father of the name
Of hermit crabs who bear
Shells with loving care

That others left behind
When death had been so kind
As to release their hold
On shells both new and old.

Alas, the great revolt
Of Proteus felt the bolt
Of failure's bitter sting—
No victory to bring.

The Protean rebellion
Failed in its subjection
Of Devon's rule so strong
That had lasted life long.

The sons of Devon held
Their power, never felled
By those who rose against
Their rule so well-fenced.

But a new frontier
Was opening, and here
The sons of Proteus would
Find what they never could

Beneath the ocean's wave:
A land where they could save
Their honor and their name
From failure and from shame.

The frontier of the trees
Where land and forest sees
New possibilities
For new societies.

There the sons of Proteus
Would find victorious
New domains to claim
For their ancestral name.

From Neo's intelligence
Without benevolence
Of wisdom from the past
To changes unsurpassed

In crustacean design
That would always shine
Throughout the ocean blue
In forms both old and new,

The lesson clear to see
For you and me
Is that intelligence
Without the sense

Of learning from the past
Will never help us last
Beyond our own short span
Of life's brief plan.

But wisdom that would hear
What ancestors held dear
And learn from their mistakes
Whatever time it takes

Will build upon the stone
Of what they've known
And reach to greater height
With clearer sight.

From Ammon's coiled shell
To Paguros' story tell
Of borrowed homes made new
From what others outgrew,

The crustaceans show
How life finds ways to grow
Beyond what seems to be
Impossibility.

The three great houses strong—
Amphipods life long,
Isopods in their place,
And Decapods' grace—

Show how diversity
In community
Can make a lineage great
Beyond what seems its fate.

From prawns to lobster claws,
Following nature's laws,
Each found their special way
To live from day to day.

The mud shrimp cities show
How builders help to grow
Beauty in the world
Though time leaves it unfurled

In fossil's stone embrace
That holds their dwelling place
For us to wonder at
Their architectural chat

With stone and sea and time
In rhythm and in rhyme
That echoes through the years
Despite our hopes and fears.

From quiet squat lobsters
To hermit crab's foster
Care of borrowed shells,
Each lineage tells

Its story of the way
To live from day to day
With what the world provides
As fortune's tide provides

Both challenges and gifts
For those whose spirit lifts
Above what seems their lot
To what time has forgot

But wisdom can restore
To those who would explore
The depths of what can be
When hearts and minds are free

To learn from those before
And build forevermore
Upon the solid ground
Where wisdom can be found.

The Protean rebellion
Failed in its subjection
Of Devon's sea-born might,
But opened up the sight

Of new frontiers to claim
Where they could make their name
In forests green and wide
With hope as their guide.

From ocean's depth to land
Built by their own hand,
The sons of Proteus would
Find what they never could

Beneath the crushing wave
Of failure they'd brave:
A chance to start anew
With vision clear and true.

The frontier called their name
To seek a different fame
Than conquest of the sea
Where Devon's dynasty

Would always hold the crown
And never be brought down
By those who rose in vain
Against his rightful reign.

But in the forest's call
They'd find what after all
They'd always searched to find:
Peace of heart and mind

Where they could build and grow
And let their children know
The joy of making new
What's beautiful and true

From wisdom of the past
And love that will last
Beyond all time and space
In evolution's grace.

From Neo's cursed intelligence
To hermit crab's defense
In borrowed shell so bright,
The story shows the sight

Of how we all must choose
What we will win or lose
In life's eternal game
Where wisdom or shame

Determines what we'll be
For all eternity
And what we'll leave behind
For those who seek to find

The path to something more
Than what came before
In glory or in pain
Through sunshine and through rain.

The crustaceans' way
Lives on to this day
In every claw and shell
That stories always tell

Of how life finds its form
Through calm and raging storm
And makes its own design
From patterns so divine

That run through space and time
In rhythm and in rhyme
With music of the spheres
That echoes through the years

Of all who dare to dream
Of more than what they seem
And turn those dreams to life
Through harmony, not strife,

With all who came before
And all forevermore
Who'll walk the paths we make
For love's eternal sake.
