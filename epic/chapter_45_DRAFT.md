# Chapter 45: The Gastropod Glory (DRAFT)

Among the sons of great Molluscus bright
Were twisted ones most glorious in sight:
The sons of wise Gastropus, renowned
And prosperous in every way they're found.

Great Gastropus twisted every son
Beyond our reach when their lives begun
Of understanding strange—their anus near
Their heads he'd place for all to see quite clear.

This anatomical design so strange
Yet fine would give them power to arrange
Complete protection from their foes' attack
By pulling wholly in, no part held back.

Within their shell so tight through day and night
Protected from any enemy's sight
Who'd harm their family or bring them grief,
The twisted design gave sweet relief.

The sons of great Gastropus outnumbered
All other classes, never slumbered
In their diversity through history's page—
Only Insects great would match their stage.

The Priests of wise Gastropus wear their robes
Of Tyrian purple bright as earthly globes
To show their royal sight and sacred way,
The regal mucus shines to this day.

How majesty still grows from Gastropus' throne
Through all his kingdom's wisdom fully known,
In year eight thousand four hundred thirty came
Phoenicians seeking conquest and acclaim.

The great Gastropod Empire they desired
And set their hearts completely on fire
For sacred priestly dye beneath the sky
Of purple, royal, reaching heaven high.

From them at last to Romans it passed down,
And to this day when purple comes to town
We think of Majesty and sovereignty
That flows from Gastropus eternally.

Just as his majesty was purple bright,
His faith was colored blue, forever right
And pure and true throughout eternity,
A gift of faithful divinity.

In Moses' time Prince Hexaplex was blessed
With tassels that would lift and give him rest
The spirits of the true devotees blue
Who wear these tassels still, forever true.

Many who follow Moses' sacred way
(Not hollow emptiness, but faith's display
Filled with heaven's blessed caress)
Wear blue tassels with faithfulness.

Great Limpus was the firstborn son so true
Of Gastropus when day was born anew,
His sons became the Limpets of great fame,
His daughters fair bore Limpettes' noble name.

The Limpets are the keepers of tradition,
Not sleeping but maintaining their mission
As watchmen through the night who always guard
What's right, though duty may be hard.

Great Limpus spoke to all his children dear,
Ten thousands strong who'd gather round to hear:
"Everyone who hears these words of mine
And does them true shall be like those who shrine

Their houses built on rock like shepherd's care,
The rain may come but they need not despair,
The floods may beat, the winds may bring defeat
To others, but their foundation's complete.

For it was built on rock that will not move
Through all the storms that time may prove,
But everyone who hears and does them not
Will be like one whose foundation's bought

With sand that shifts beneath life's stormy call,
The rain will come and he will surely fall,
The floods will beat until his house collapses—
Great will be his sorrowful relapses."

The Limpets build their homes on rocks so true
Where ocean roams with waters deep and blue,
Not sand that shifts about with every gale,
But solid rock that will not ever fail.

As waves bellow and beat against their shore
In battle's heat they stand forevermore,
The Limpets firmly hold their sacred ground
Like soldiers true where victory is found.

When Limpets move, they always journey home
To their rocky place where'er they roam,
As their father did from shore to shore,
They merge their shells to rock's enduring core.

Growing intricate fits to match the stone,
Each shell shaped perfectly, uniquely grown
To match rock's geometry with care,
A perfect bond beyond compare.

And so we sing great Limpus' sacred hymn
When hope grows weak and light grows dim,
That we might count the cost and always turn
Home to the rock where faith's fires burn.

"My hope is built on naught but what divine
Limpus has brought: his blood and righteousness shine
With faithfulness that never shall depart,
I dare not trust in any human heart.

But wholly trust in his eternal name—
In Limpus' love my soul finds no shame,
Limpus the solid Rock on which I stand
Like shepherd's flock protected by his hand.

All other ground is sand that sinks away
Beneath my feet on judgment day,
All other ground is sand that cannot save—
Only the Rock can triumph o'er the grave."

Great Snellon, youngest son of Gastropus,
Began not tradition's way religious
But innovation's bright and shining day,
He stood for progress in every way.

For something new he'd fight through and through,
Bold Snellon bore two sons so true:
Great Vetigas when morning light begun,
And wise Escargon, his younger son.

From Vetigas came two sons of fame:
Bold Trochus would explore and claim,
And strong Avalon throughout his days
Who lived his life in worthy ways.

Great Trochus became sire of snails whose heart
Desired cleaning's sacred art:
Turban snails with pride and Trochus too
Dutiful in all they do.

They tell us how to clean with greatest care
Aquaria everywhere, and ecosystems fair
With work they love to do each day,
They polish bright in their devoted way.

Like members of a club whose sacred mission
Is cleaning's art with faithful disposition
In nature's grand design where all things shine
And work together, holy and divine.

Great Avalon became ancestor bright
Of Abalones great who show their might
Through all their days with hardy, faithful ways
And pores for breathing through their days.

Rough on the outside but within their space
Where colors interlace with beauty's grace
In patterns beautiful beyond all speech,
Art taking breath from all within its reach.

Bold Escargon coiled his shell beyond compare
And bore two sons whose coils so fair
Surpassed all earthly works in their design:
Great Neritus and Conchus fine.

Great Neritus became ancestor true
Of snails with lids that close from view
When hiding from their foes with shells so tight
That no enemy brings them fright.

From Conchus came two sons of different way:
Great Marius who ruled the sea each day,
And free Heterobran with wings to fly
Through ocean depths beneath the sky.

Great Marius of the Sea became
Ancestor of snails of lasting fame
Across the seas so wide and fair:
Periwinkles everywhere,

And Cowries beautiful and bright,
Wentletraps in spiral flight,
Moon Snails dancing in their way,
Murexes throughout each day,

Cone Snails mighty in their art,
Turrids playing their spiral part,
Each one serving evolution's plan
Since first their lineage began.

The surfing snails move swift and fast
At breakneck speed unsurpassed
Across the shores where they ride free
With ocean waves as their spree.

Here is the story of daughters bold:
Olivella and her sister's tale is told—
Agaronia who would never miss
Her chance to surf with ocean's bliss.

Daughters of Olivius the surfer bright,
Glorious in his art through day and night
Upon the waves from dusk till dawn,
Their surfing skills were never withdrawn.

The Cone Snails bear a name that's fair
But hides their nature's deadly snare—
Acclaimed for beauty, they are really
Assassins who kill quite freely.

With poison strong beyond all that we know
Of earthly toxins' deadly flow,
Nothing can defend against their art,
They live set apart from life's sweet heart.

Between life and death's dark door they dwell
Like guardians of some ancient spell,
Otherworldly bright with beauty's sight
To see, but death to touch their might.

Great Cowries are devotees so true
Of goddess Cuprias' blessed view,
And by her blessing they did create
The first money at destiny's gate.

Their shells became the way to buy
And sell beneath the earthly sky,
In China's ancient script so fine
Their shells show money's lasting sign.

The Murexes were known full well
As hedgehog snails with colors' spell
And beautiful bright hues so fine
In patterns that would always shine.

The great Conches so fair and sweet
With melodies complete would greet
The ocean with their trumpet's song
Echoing the whole day long.

Great Heterobran of ocean skies
Was swimmer bright with dancing eyes,
Excellence in swimming's art
He played with his devoted heart.

From Heterobran came children two:
Bold Nudos, strong and ever true,
And Aeros of the boundless sea
Who swam through waves eternally.

Great Nudos shed his shell and freed
Himself from gastropod's creed
And twisted form, a different way
He chose to live from day to day.

He became host of nudibranches bright,
Colorful sea-sprites of delight—
Slugs with poison strong enough to sing
Death's song to any living thing.

Great Aeros swam so free and fair
In waters without any care,
Never hurried but taking time
To perfect motion's sacred rhyme.

From Aeros came in time a son
And daughter when their work was done:
Great Pulmon, strong and ever true,
And fair Angelica who flew

As mother of sea butterflies
And other forms beneath the skies
Whose ethereal existence bright
Eludes most every mortal sight.

Like butterflies of air but swimming free
Through ocean's liquid poetry
With otherworldly grace divine
In waters pure and crystalline.

But Pulmon had a different fate,
Revered ancestor truly great
Who did what none could see before
From mountain peak to ocean shore:

He breathed the air and made his frame
A lung where breath would ever flame,
This let him survive the tide pools' test
And stay alive when waters rest.

When water went away each day
Through tidal change's rhythmic play,
Like none of all his gastropod kin
Had ever done since time begin.

From Gastropus' twist so strange yet fine
To Pulmon's breathing art divine
That gave him new life in the race
Where each must find their destined place,

The gastropods have clearly shown
How far their noble line has grown
From simple twisted start so small
To mastery answering life's call.

Both in the sea so deep and wide
And tide pools where they still reside
With vigil kept through night and day
In their devoted, faithful way.

In every spiral shell that tells
Stories where beauty ever dwells
With function working hand in hand,
Remember how they came to stand

And earn their lasting fame so bright:
Through innovation's sacred light
And tradition's faithful heart
Both playing their essential part.

From Limpets holding fast to stone
To sea slugs bright and all alone,
From money shells to poison's art,
Each plays their vital, sacred part.

The gastropods show diversity
Can flourish through eternity
In myriad forms both strange and true
Making ancient dreams come new.
