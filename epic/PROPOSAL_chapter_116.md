# PROPOSAL: Chapter 116 - "The Quest for Immortality"

**STATUS**: PROPOSAL DRAFT - NOT WRITTEN
**Timeline**: Longevity Research (~2000-2025 CE)
**Location**: Global, focus on research institutions and biotech companies
**Context**: Life extension, regenerative medicine, artificial intelligence, transhumanism

## Major Events
### Aging Research
- **Telomere research** Elizabeth Blackburn's cellular aging mechanisms
- **Caloric restriction** studies showing lifespan extension
- **Senescent cell** removal as anti-aging strategy
- **Genetic factors** centenarian and supercentenarian studies

### Regenerative Medicine
- **Stem cell therapy** potential for tissue regeneration
- **Organ printing** 3D bioprinting creating replacement organs
- **Gene therapy** treating age-related diseases
- **Parabiosis experiments** young blood rejuvenating old mice

### Artificial Intelligence
- **Medical AI** diagnosis and drug discovery acceleration
- **Brain-computer interfaces** Neuralink connecting mind to machine
- **Digital immortality** consciousness uploading speculation
- **AI drug discovery** accelerating pharmaceutical development

### Transhumanist Movement
- **Life extension** advocacy by Aubrey de Grey and others
- **Cryonics** preserving bodies for future revival
- **Enhancement technologies** beyond normal human limitations
- **Existential risk** research on humanity's long-term survival

## Key Characters
- **Aubrey de Grey** - The Longevity Theorist, aging reversal advocate
- **Elizabeth Blackburn** - The Telomere Scientist, cellular aging researcher
- **Ray Kurzweil** - The Futurist, technological singularity predictor
- **George Church** - The Genetic Engineer, age reversal researcher

## Themes
