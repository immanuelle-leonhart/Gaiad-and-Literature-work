# Chapter 33: The Conservative Path (DRAFT)

Among the three great ancestors bright,
Those ancient processors of light,
Great Spiralius was most conservative,
His ways preservative.

He fished with tentacles long and strong,
As fathers had done all along.
The ancient art he kept alive
To help his children thrive.

Great Spiralius worked each day
In his most diligent way
To provide for children all
Who answered duty's sacred call.

Among his many sons of fame
Two earned eternal name:
Bold Kimberella the king so bright
And great Gnathifer's might.

Great Kimberella earned his fame
Through his eternal name.
His tomb is visited today
By pilgrims on their way.

The greatest king was he
Of his time's dynasty.
His kingdom moved with mighty power
Across the steppe in every hour.

A billion years of fame so bright
Belongs to his great sight.
On Australian stamps today
His image holds its sway.

But brave Gnathifer chose another path,
To show his righteous wrath.
A kingdom small but quick and keen
He built with cunning seen.

Like brave Ectus he could see
The need for weaponry.
A mighty jaw he built with care
From chitin strong and fair.

A sugar jaw so sweet and bright
For sugar treats delight,
But though his jaw was sugar-made,
His heart was not so stayed.

With ferocious jaws so keen
He brought the fearsome scene
To sons of brave Isomeres
Throughout their territories.

In old age from his loins came forth
Two sons of different worth:
Bold Gnathos, fierce and wild,
And Hydrover, gentler child.

Great Gnathos was vicious
More than malicious.
His sons are known today
As Jaw Worms in their way.

But brave Xenognath was different,
Though still belligerent.
He grew jaws within jaws bright,
Against nature's ancient sight.

Fifteen jaws in all he made,
A fearsome masquerade.
Each jaw within the last
Held prey both firm and fast.

From brave Xenognath came two sons:
Bold Marinus, who runs
The seas with might and main,
And great Limnos of the rain.

Great Marinus fought and fought
For all that could be caught.
Dominion of the boundless sea
Was his priority.

But poor Limnos was cast out
From the ocean's route.
Into the rivers he was sent,
His kingdom there was bent.

The sons of brave Marinus mock
Their freshwater flock:
"Small jawed ones," they call
Their cousins one and all.

From great Marinus came two more:
Bold Rotiferus to explore
And brave Amisquius,
Bold and glorious.

Great Rotiferus looked around
And peaceful living found
Among great Kimberella's line,
Their ways both good and fine.

He turned to fishing once again,
Like his ancient kin.
His sons became the nomads true,
The Rotifers we view.

In all waters they roam free,
Making everywhere their spree.
Great fishermen are they
From night until the day.

He built his coelom loose and light
Like Ectus let take flight.
This gave him speed and grace
In every watery place.

In rotifer villages bright
They practice their delight.
Fishing with their wheels so true
For all their daily food.

But among his sons there was
One who broke the laws.
Red Acanthus the base,
A parasite's disgrace.

He lives in others' guts so deep
And steals like greedy sheep
The food that should belong
To those both right and strong.

Such thievery brings shame
To great Rotiferus' name.
A black sheep in the fold
Whose story should be told.

But from brave Amisquius came
A line of greater fame.
Each generation grew
Jaws bigger through and through.

In Nimrod Bristletongue's time
Their power reached its prime.
They ruled the seas with might,
A fearsome, awesome sight.

More numerous than all
Who answered ocean's call,
The Arrow Worms became
The hunters' greatest name.

The greatest hunters ever seen
Beneath the ocean green.
Their jaws could catch and hold
The bravest and the bold.

Through waters dark and deep
Their vigil they do keep.
No prey can swim away
From their hunting display.

The conservative path so bright
Sometimes shows its might
In children who rebel
And stories they do tell.

Great Spiralius kept the old ways true
But his children grew
In many different directions,
Making their selections.

Some stayed with fishing pure,
Their methods tried and sure.
Others chose the warrior's way
To fight another day.

From tentacles to jaws so bright,
Following nature's sight,
Each lineage found its place
In evolution's race.

The rotifer's gentle art
Of fishing warms the heart.
While arrow worms show might
In predatory sight.

Both trace their lineage back
To great Spiralius' track.
The conservative way
Led to diverse display.

In every freshwater pond
Where rotifers respond
To plankton floating by
Beneath the morning sky,

Remember their ancestor bright
Who was fishing's light.
Great Spiralius kept the art
That gave them their start.

In every arrow worm so keen
That makes sea fishes keen,
His heritage lives on and on
From dusk until the dawn.

The three great patriarchs bright
Left their lasting sight
On all life in the sea
Through all eternity.

But great Spiralius shows us well
That traditions tell
Important truths that last
Through future and past.

Innovation has its place
In evolution's race,
But keeping what works true
Is wisdom through and through.
