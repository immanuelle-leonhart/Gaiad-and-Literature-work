Arboreus, son of Tracheus great,
Was settler king of royal fate.
A monarch who would divide
The world both far and wide.

Arboreus split the earth
Between two sons of worth:
Lycos and Ginkgon strong,
Each to rule life long.

Lycos released with might
Countless spores in sight,
And by those spores he bore
Two sons to explore:

Isolagos the wise
And Lycopodion's eyes
That saw what could be made
In forest's dappled shade.

Lycopodion became
Ancestor of the name
Of clubmosses so tall,
The greatest of them all.

He built a city grand
Throughout the fertile land
So giant it became
Known by the famous name

Of "first tree" in the world,
A scale tree, branches curled
Toward heaven's shining light
Both day and through night.

Today his spores are known
As powder that has grown
To be called by his name:
Lycopodium's flame.

Used for the power bright
Of fire's burning light,
His legacy lives on
From dusk until dawn.

Isolagos split his spores
Into what nature stores
As male and female kinds,
With his devoted minds

He raised his children all
Who answered duty's call
Within his city's walls
Where love forever falls.

Isolagos bore two sons:
Quill when day begun
And Sellagine the strong
Who lived his whole life long.

The sons of Sellagine
Would creep in forest's shrine
Their leaves across the ground
Where they could be found.

In dry times they would die
Beneath the burning sky,
But when the wet returned
Their life would be re-earned.

Sellagine reviving
Shows how life, surviving
Even death itself,
Can rise from sorrow's shelf.

The sons of Quill became
Known by the famous name
Of Quillworts, and they grew
Their leaves so straight and true.

Microphylls they raised
High up to be praised
By all who saw their sight
Reaching toward the light.

With no stomata made
To help them in their trade
Of breathing, they absorbed
Air from ground, not absorbed

Through leaves but through their root
That served them like a suit
Of armor underground
Where they could be found.

Their spores grew in water
As nature taught her
Children how to thrive
And stay alive.

Ginkgon branched his leaves
Two by two, like sheaves
Of grain, and so his leaves
Were what science achieves

To call megaphyllic—
Large and quite prolific
In surface for the sun
When day was done.

And he bore a son bright
Named Phyllon, whose sight
Would see what could be made
In evolution's trade.

Phyllon begat two more:
Pteridos to explore
And Gymnos, strong and true,
Who different pathways knew.

Pteridos begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
Horsa and Euspor,
Each seeking something more.

Horsa begat Equis,
Whose name would never miss
Its mark in history's
Eternal mysteries.

As gametophyte the spawn
Of Equis, when drawn
To swim and find their bride,
Would search both far and wide.

And they found Puzella
Fair beyond all stellar
Beauty, and they grew
Roots there, strong and true.

Equis reduced his veins
To one, through joys and pains,
Like Lycos did before,
From mountain peak to shore.

He became ancestor
Of puzzlegrass, protector
Of nutrients and more
In winter's icy store.

He built armor strong
Of silicon life long
To protect his city bright
From dangers day and night.

He spilt ink on his scroll
And lost what made him whole:
The megaphylls of old
Were lost, the story's told.

His leaves were one vein
Through sunshine and through rain,
Like Lycos in his day
Who showed him the way.

In summer he would build
Puzzlegrass, and it filled
His stores with nutrients
For future residents.

And when winter passed away
On some bright, shining day,
He'd use what he had stored
To please his faithful Lord.

In spring as snow would melt
And warmth was truly felt,
He built horsetails high
Reaching toward the sky.

With no chlorophyll green,
Only spores could be seen—
And lots of them he made
In springtime's bright parade.

His spores spread far and wide
Across the countryside
To every nation's shore
From here forevermore.

In summer he'd destroy
His horsetails without joy
And build puzzlegrass new
To see the season through.

And his sons and daughters all
From horsetails heard the call
To build puzzlegrass too
When summer's work was due.

And so the sons of bright
Equis and daughters' sight
Of Puzella came to rule
Like some eternal school

All across the world
Where banners were unfurled
Of their authority
Through all eternity.

Euspor begat two sons:
Adderos when begun
The day, and Fernando
Whose work would always show.

Adderos begat then
Two children beyond ken:
Ophios and Psilos,
Each with different goals.

Ophios became the sire
Of adder-tongues' choir:
He built but one leaf
Beyond all belief—

Giant in its size
Beneath the starry skies,
One leaf to rule them all
Who answered duty's call.

And Psilos became father
Of whisk ferns, who'd rather
Build no leaves at all
But stand both proud and tall

Without the leafy crown
That others wore around
Their stems like royal dress—
Simplicity's success.

Fernando uncoiled wide
A great frond, like a guide
To show what could be made
In forest's dappled shade.

A frond of leaves so fair
That danced upon the air
Like some eternal song
Throughout his whole life long.

Maratton begat two:
Marattidus so true
And Leptos, who would be
Living peacefully.

Maratidus bore spores
Ten thousand, and what's more,
On each leaf he would place
This multitude's embrace.

While Leptos bore a mere
Hundred, crystal clear
In number, small but true
In all that he would do.

Together they became
Ancestors of the name
Of ferns throughout the land
Built by their own hand.

As sons of Arboreus
Settled, glorious,
The lands from sea to sea,
They built for all to see

Great swamps across the flow
Of Mississippi's go
From north down to the south
Where river meets the mouth

Of ocean's salty brine
In mixing so fine
Of fresh and salt that made
A perfect place, well-made

For life to find its way
From water's ancient day
To land's new frontier
Where hope conquered fear.

And it was here at last
When time and fate had passed
Their judgment on the world
And change was unfurled,

Our ancestors would climb—
The sons of Osticthus' time
Would make the leap at last
From water to the vast

Expanse of land so green
The greatest ever seen
By those who dared to dream
Of more than what they seem.

From Arboreus' division
To Fernando's vision
Of fronds that dance on air,
The plants show everywhere

How life finds its way
From night into the day
Of possibility
For all eternity.

From Lycos' burning spores
To fern's ten thousand stores
Of reproductive might,
Each found their own sight

Of how to spread their seed
And fill the world's need
For green and growing things
That hope eternal brings.

The clubmoss cities tall,
The quillworts standing all
With leaves that reach on high,
The horsetails that try

To balance seasons' call
With storage for them all
In puzzlegrass so bright
Throughout the winter's night—

Each shows a different way
To live from day to day
In harmony with time
And nature's ancient rhyme.

From one-veined simple leaves
To fronds that autumn weaves
Into a tapestry
Of possibility,

The plants remind us all
Who hear their gentle call
That life will always find
A way to free the mind

From limitations old
In stories never told
Of what we're meant to be
If we would just be free

To grow beyond the small
And heed the greater call
Of what we can achieve
When we truly believe

In possibility
Through all eternity
Where dreams can all come true
For me and you today.

The swamps that Arboreus
Built, so glorious,
Became the perfect place
For evolution's grace

To work its magic spell
And help life to excel
Beyond what was before
To open up the door

Of land's great frontier
Where those who conquered fear
Could build their cities new
With vision clear and true.

From water's ancient home
To land where we could roam
Free from the weight
Of water's ancient fate,

The plants prepared the way
For life's eternal day
When all would find their place
In evolution's race.

The sons of Osticthus
Would soon, victorious,
Make their way to land
Built by the green hand

Of those who came before
To open up the door
Of possibility
For all humanity.

From Arboreus' great reign
To swamps across the plain
Of Mississippi's flow,
The story helps us know

How every ending becomes
New beginning's drums
That beat the rhythm strong
Of life's eternal song.

The plants that colonized
The land and organized
Their cities green and wide
With hope as their guide

Show us the way to be
Pioneers, bold and free,
Who dare to leave behind
The limits that bind

Our spirits to the past
And help our dreams at last
Take wing and learn to fly
Beneath the starry sky

Where all things are possible
For those who're not impossible
To change and grow and be
More than they seem to be.

From spore to frond to tree,
The plants show you and me
How life will always find
A way to free the mind

And help the heart to grow
Beyond what we can know
Alone, but when we share
Our dreams and hopes and care,

The whole world can become
A place where all can come
To find their rightful place
In evolution's grace

That never ceases moving
Toward what's improving
All life everywhere
With love beyond compare.

The Arboreus legacy
Lives through eternity
In every tree that grows
And every flower that shows

Its face toward the sun
When day has just begun
With hope for what can be
When hearts and minds are free

To dream and dare and grow
Beyond what we can know
But feel within our hearts
Where love's true journey starts.
