This is the book that tells
Of generations' spells:
The lineage of Janus
So glorious.

Janusicthus begat
Two sons: first he begat
Kondricthus, strong and true,
And Osticthus too.

As they lived in the sea
Their waters came to be
Suffocating, toxic, wild,
No place for any child.

One day they prayed with might
To Elohim's great sight
For solution to their plight—
An offering of right

One hundred trilobites
They gave to heaven's lights
And waited for reply
Beneath the starry sky.

And Elohim said then
To these two faithful men:
"I shall grant to one of you
A gift both strange and true:

Sight to see the stars
Beyond all earthly bars,
And to the other I
Shall grant what will not die:

A nose to smell the scents
Of life's experiments—
All chemicals that flow
Through all you'll ever know."

Chondricthus said with pride:
"I as eldest will decide—
The nose I'll take for me
To rule the boundless sea.

I'll outhunt placoderms
And conquer all their germs
Of resistance to my might
Both day and through night."

And so he was granted there
A nose beyond compare:
A thousand scents could tell
His story very well.

Osticthus received instead
What blessed his line ahead:
A ring of bone around
Each eye, where could be found

The lens that held his sight,
And cells both new and bright:
Cone cells that could detect
All colors to perfect

His vision of the world
Where possibilities unfurled
In every hue and shade
That light had ever made.

And so the sons of bright
Osticthus ruled by sight
While sons of Kondricthus
Ruled by scent, glorious.

Kondricthus smelled afar
Sweet waters like a star
That called him from his home
To distant waters' foam.

While Osticthus could see
The clean air, bright and free,
Of heaven high above
And all therein to love.

He saw the sons of bright
Arthropus in his sight
Who'd made their home on land
Built by their own hand.

Acanthus, Kondricthus' son,
When his work was done
Challenged the mighty reign
Of Placoderms' domain.

He built a skeleton
Not bone, but built upon
Cartilage soft yet strong
That served him lifelong.

His wife laid just a few
Eggs, precious, tried and true,
That they cared for with might
Both day and through night.

Osticthus swam one day
Up Elivagar's way—
The river we now call
Mississippi's hall

And New River too,
Where waters, pure and true,
Would lead him to his fate
At heaven's shining gate.

Osticthus breathed the air
Through spiracles with care,
As he opened his cheeks
To find what spirit seeks.

And then he pushed it down,
Like wearing wisdom's crown,
Down his throat it went
On its divine descent.

And so his spiracles
Became the miracles
For air, not water's flow—
A change that helped him grow.

The sons of Osticthus
Sing hymns victorious
Of Elivagar's might
That filled their hearts with sight

Of home where they belong
In mountains' ancient song
Where life is old and deep
And memories always keep

Their vigil through the years
Despite all joys and fears
That mark the passage of
Time's eternal love.

Osticthus married fair
Eutelea, beyond compare
In beauty and in grace,
And in their dwelling place

Together they bore two
Sons, noble, tried and true:
Actinus and Sacropter,
Each destined for chapter

In evolution's book
Where those who dare to look
Can see what time has wrought
And what their choices brought.

Sacropter saw potential
In what was essential
About the forest green
Of Elivagar's scene.

He swam between the trees
With graceful expertise
And built with loving care
Strong bony fins to bear

His weight as he would push
Through forest's leafy bush
With lobed fins strong and wide
That served him as his guide.

While Actinus could see
That air's sweet harmony
Within his belly bright
Could give him power's sight

To fly beneath the wave
Like some heroic brave
Adventurer of the deep
Where ancient secrets keep.

His lung became the way
To float throughout the day:
A swim bladder so light
That gave him graceful sight

Of conquest in the sea.
He went on to be
Ruler of Baltic's might
With fins that caught the light

Like rays of morning sun
When his great work was done.
Ray fins he built with care
That danced upon the air

Of water, and he wed
Andrea Lepis, who bred
Nine hundred eggs so bright
That filled the world with sight.

And so the sons of bright
Osticthus gained the sight
To rule with vision clear:
Actinus without fear

And Sacropter so strong
Who served his whole lifelong
The forests' gentle call
That beckoned one and all.

And Acanthus, the son
Of Chondricthus, begun
His reign with scenting power
Throughout each passing hour.

These three became the fathers
Of lines that nothing bothers:
The three great vertebrate
Houses of their fate.

From Janus' legacy
Through all eternity
The vertebrates would show
How families can grow

From single source so small
To rule both great and tall
The waters and the land
Built by their own hand.

From toxic waters' plight
To heaven's pure delight
Of air and forest green
And all that could be seen,

The sons of Janus found
Their way on solid ground
Of innovation's art
That touched each faithful heart.

From cartilage to bone,
From waters to the zone
Of air and forest deep,
Each found what they could keep

As legacy so true
For me and you
Who trace our lineage back
To those who stayed on track

Through every trial and test
That challenged them to best
Their limits and transcend
What others comprehend.

From nose that smells the scent
Of every element
To eyes that see the light
Of stars both day and night,

The gifts that heaven gave
To those who were brave
Enough to pray for help
When overwhelmed by kelp

Of troubles that would drown
Their hopes and drag them down
To depths of dark despair
Beyond what they could bear

Show us the way to be
Both faithful and free
In asking for the aid
That we ourselves have made

Impossible to find
Within our mortal mind
But heaven always knows
How every story goes

And what each soul requires
To kindle their desires
For more than what they seem
In evolution's dream.

From Kondricthus' scent
To Osticthus' ascent
To cleaner air above
Through divine love,

The vertebrates remind
Us that the seeking mind
That looks beyond the small
Will always hear the call

Of something greater than
What any mortal man
Can comprehend alone
But makes itself known

To those who dare to pray
For help along the way
And trust that heaven sees
What mortals cannot seize

With their own strength alone
But must be freely shown
By grace that flows from high
Beneath the starry sky.

From toxic water's curse
To freedom's blessed verse
That sings of hope renewed
And spirits that pursued

Their destiny with faith
Beyond what others saith
Is possible for those
Who face what no one knows

The ending of their tale
But trust they will not fail
If they but ask for aid
From those who never fade

But watch from realms above
With never-ending love
For all who seek to grow
Beyond what they can know

Through their own strength alone
But find they are not thrown
Upon the world to face
Its trials without grace

That lifts them up on high
Beneath the starry sky
Where all things are made new
For me and you.

The three great houses born
From Janus' chosen morn
When heaven blessed his line
With gifts of the divine

Show us that every choice
To lift up our voice
In prayer for what we need
Will plant a blessed seed

That grows beyond our sight
Into the morning light
Of possibilities
That nobody sees

But those who dare to trust
That more than earthly dust
Composes what we are
Beneath each shining star.

From Elivagar's flow
To all we'll ever know
Of home where we belong
In evolution's song,

The vertebrates have shown
How far we've grown
From humble, simple start
To mastery of art

That sees with clearer eyes
Beneath the starry skies
And smells the scents that tell
Of stories none can spell

But those who've learned to read
The signs that always lead
To greater things than what
Our minds have ever caught

In their small nets of thought
But heaven's wisdom brought
To those who dare to be
More than they seem to be.

The legacy lives on
From dusk until dawn
In every vertebrate
Who shares our common fate

Of growth beyond the small
To heed the greater call
Of what we can become
When we are not numb

To heaven's gentle voice
That gives us the choice
To be more than we seem
In evolution's dream.

From Janus to the three
Great houses, we can see
How prayer and faith combined
Can free the searching mind

And help the heart to grow
Beyond what we can know
Alone, but when we trust
In more than earthly dust,

The whole world opens wide
With grace as our guide
To heights we never dreamed
When we were what seemed

Too small to make a change
Beyond familiar range
But found that heaven's might
Can lift us to the light

Of all we're meant to be
Through all eternity
Where every dream comes true
For me and you.
