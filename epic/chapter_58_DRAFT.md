# Chapter 58: The Fungal Kingdom (DRAFT)

From Plantus bright came Dikar's parasitic line,
The twentieth generation's noble son,
With two nuclei joined by love's design
To live as one when their long day was done.

He married fair Ferma with faithful heart,
Together blessed with children strong and true:
Ascus and Baston, each to play their part
In spreading fungal kingdoms fresh and new.

Ascus became the father of Cup Fungi,
Who ruled the forest floor with gentle might,
While Baston raised his mushroom progeny
From woodland soil into the morning light.

From great Ascus came two sons of fame:
Taphrin the small and bright Saccharos,
Each choosing how to glorify his name
In service to the world where life bestows.

Taphrin lived simply as a yeast so small,
Within the plants he made his humble home,
He doubled, split, then answered duty's call
To spread his spores wherever winds would roam.

His fission yeasts can dwell within our lungs
And cause us pain when our defenses fail,
Yet still in nature's chorus he has sung
His part within the grand, eternal tale.

Saccharos left the parasitic way
To dwell within the soil as decomposer,
He broke from theft to earn his honest pay
And became life's recycling composer.

He bore two sons in days of ancient lore:
Peziz the wise and noble Melchizedek,
Whose legacy would bless forevermore
The bread and beer that human souls protect.

Great Melchizedek became a humble cell,
A yeast whose budding sons would multiply,
In spheres of purity they came to dwell
And lift our daily bread toward the sky.

He is the greatest of all yeast on earth,
His power makes our bread and beer divine,
Through fermentation's gift he brings forth
The blessed sustenance of bread and wine.

From great Peziz came Lopez and bright
Orbillus, hunter of the nematode,
Each found his own appointed path of light
To serve within life's ever-changing code.

From Lopez came Ganymede the blessed
And complex Leotios of intricate ways,
Cup fungi and filaments expressed
Their beauty through their long and faithful days.

Lecanius became the noble sire
Of lichens' partnership 'tween plant and friend,
Two species joined by love's enduring fire
To make their symbiotic union blend.

And from this line came blue Penicillius,
Whose cheese and healing gifts we celebrate,
His antibiotic power glorious
Makes infections flee and health create.

From Baston's line came Ortho strong and true
And great Puccini of the complex rust,
With genomes large and life cycles new
They show what evolution's art must trust.

Bold Botry chose the simpler yeast's design,
Content to live alone in peaceful ways,
While Ortho's sons would make their lineage shine
Through all their long and evolutionary days.

Ustella blesses corn with protein sweet,
Her smuts are treasured gifts in Mexico,
Where grateful people reverently eat
The sacred food that makes their spirits glow.

Agaricus left the forest green behind
To seek the desert's harsh and lonely call,
Four sons he bore of worth and noble mind:
Jello, Bartholomew, William, and All.

Great Jello formed bright vessels made of gel
And returned to Virginia's forests deep,
Where rainfall's song and ancient trees would tell
Of mysteries that jellyshrooms keep.

Tremello spent his youth as simple yeast
But found in age a jellyshroom's bright form,
A wondrous gift for the forest's feast
That weathers every evolutionary storm.

While great Agaricus showed the world's first sight
Of mushrooms rising from the forest floor,
A form of beauty, wonder, and delight
Unknown to any age that came before.

His sons create the mushrooms we hold dear
When hunger calls and we would taste their good,
But toadstools hide their poison dark and drear
Within what should be our nutritious food.

Eat mushrooms well, but never trust the cap
That toadstools wear to hide their deadly spite,
For they will spring their poisonous, fatal trap
And steal away your life and blessed sight.

From Dikar's parasitic ancient start
To mushrooms' healing, blessed, and sacred art,
The fungi show how life can grow each day
Beyond what we imagine on our way.

From simple small beginnings in the ground
To forms with victory and triumph crowned,
They teach us partnership can conquer all
When we but hear and answer love's sweet call.

The two nuclei that through their lifetime dwell
Together show us how two souls unite
Can work as one and serve each other well
And fill the world with everlasting light.

From great Melchizedek's blessed yeast so true
That makes our bread and beer for daily feast
To lichens' partnership 'tween me and you
That shows love's power will never, ever cease,

The fungi teach us how we ought to live
In harmony with all who share our days,
With generous hearts that freely, gladly give
And fill our world with hope and loving praise.

From healing penicillin's sacred might
To jellyshrooms that shine like morning dew,
The fungi fill our world with pure delight
And show what partnerships can help us do.

From simple soil to healing's blessed art,
The fungi show that each can play their part
In life's great song of possibility
Where love reigns through all eternity.
