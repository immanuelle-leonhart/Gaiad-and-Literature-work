# Chapter 27: The Dutrus Innovation (DRAFT)

From great Anu's unique lineage came
Two sons of very different fame:
Bold Enki, seeker of the sea,
And faithful Homos, keeping harmony.

While brave Homos chose his father's way,
Content to live as they always stay,
Great Enki felt adventure's call
To sail beyond the harbor wall.

"I shall explore the ocean wide,"
Declared brave Enki with great pride.
"My creatures shall both move and scurry
Through seas and lands without worry."

He built a galley, great and grand,
The finest vessel in the land.
With millions of oars arrayed,
His mighty barge was made.

His head faced forward to the sea,
His men rowed powerfully.
Through waves both high and low,
They made their vessel go.

But soon great Enki found his plight:
Lost in the endless night.
No landmarks could he see,
Adrift upon the sea.

"I need wise men," brave Enki said,
"To guide where we are led.
Bring me astrologers so keen
To read what stars have seen."

The Flamens came, his priestly band,
Flask cells from the land.
These stargazers would divine
The paths through space and time.

The Flamens looked into the sky
And saw with their trained eye
Rich larvae floating by
With yolks that multiply.

"Here," they said, "the signs are right
To build beneath this sight.
The stars align above
To bless what we love."

But as they prayed for guidance true,
The gods came into view.
Each brought a sacred gift,
To help their spirits lift.

Dark Tyrosine the Devil came
With three spells of flame:
Adrenaline's rush so bright,
Noradrenaline's fight,
And Dopamine's delight.

Then bright Tryptophanes the Sun
Blessed them, every one,
With Serotonin's day
And Melatonin's way.

For twilight's mystic hour,
He brought DMT's power.
The sacred visions came
In the twilight's name.

Great Glutama the Empress brought
The balance that she taught:
GABA's calming peace
And Glutamate's release.

"We need more spells," said Enki wise,
"To help our people rise.
If Jehovah's will be done,
More magic must be won."

Great Mithra heard his plea
And blessed him by the sea
With Acetylcholine's might
To coordinate their sight.

Fair Iodina, mother great,
Revealed love's incarnate:
The sacred CYIQNCPLG,
Oxytocin's key.

Then Kali, dark and deep,
Gave spells to soothe and keep:
Three endorphins strong
To right what has gone wrong.

Alpha's sequence clear:
YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVT here.
Beta's longer chain:
YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVTLFKNAIIKNAYKKGE's refrain.
Gamma's shorter form:
YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVTL in the storm.

These became the tools
That break pain's rules:
Opium's ancient call,
Morphine for all,
Heroin's dark embrace,
Fentanyl's dangerous face.

All these incantations blessed
Became the chemicals that test
The nervous system's might:
Neurotransmitters' light.

The Flamens learned to spear
The larvae swimming near.
Coordinated, they became
Nematocysts by name.

Their hunting grew precise
As they struck once and twice.
Their spears would never miss
Their targets in the abyss.

Soon cables stretched between
The hunters, long and keen.
Telegraph wires of old
Became nerves, brave and bold.

And this is why today
Priests carry, so they say,
Spears and wires combined
To serve the sacred mind.

Through neural networks wide,
Great Enki's people could provide
Robotic arms so strong
Around their city's song.

These arms would catch with ease
The larvae from the seas.
His power grew and grew
As his great city flew.

He covered tentacles all
With Choanocytes' call,
To catch both great and small
Fish that rise and fall.

Great Enki's city was a sight
Of technological might.
Proto-animal in form,
It weathered every storm.

From brave Enki came two sons
When his great work was done:
Bold Paraxus the strong
And Xiangus life long.

Now brave Xiangus took the way
Of robotic arms' display.
His fishermen arranged
On arms that never changed.

From great Xiangus came the line
Of fair Daihua so fine.
Whose beauty was renowned
Wherever she was found.

From great Daihua's noble race
Came brave Dinomischus' grace.
A creature strange and tall
Who towered over all.

And from this ancient lord
Came bright Siphus, by accord
The ancestor of all
The comb jellies' call.

These Ctenophores so bright
Move with rainbow light.
Their combs catch the sun
As through waves they run.

But bold Paraxus the great
Would found a different state.
His lineage would grow
To realms we yet don't know.

Far greater nations he
Would father by the sea.
His legacy would span
The future's plan.

From great Enki's bold design
Came the neural line.
The nervous system's start
Played its crucial part.

The chemicals that flow
Through minds both high and low
Were born upon that day
When Enki sailed away.

In every thought we think,
In every neural link,
Great Enki's ancient quest
Lives on in our breast.

The neurotransmitters' dance
In every glance
Recalls that fateful hour
When gods gave their power.

So honor brave Enki bright,
Who sailed the endless night.
His courage and his quest
Gave neurons to our nest.

The Flamens' starry sight,
The nematocysts' might,
The neural networks vast
All came from ages past.

In every brain that thinks,
In every nerve that links,
The echo still rings true
Of brave Enki's journey through.

The animals that move
With coordinated groove
All trace their lineage back
To great Enki's neural track.

From sponge to human mind,
The pattern still we find:
The nervous system's art
Connects each beating heart.
