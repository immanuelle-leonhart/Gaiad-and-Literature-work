From Fimbulwinter's grip, the world lay cold,
Where ice had claimed the seas and poisoned air.
Yet in the depths, new stories would unfold,
As life found ways to heal beyond despair.

From Mehuthen's line came Starvos the keen,
Who bore his son bright Navros in the night.
Then Navros sired bold Gravros, strong and lean,
Who faced the world with viral, cunning might.

Now Gravros wed fair Heimdalla the true,
That watchful guardian of the arctic realm.
Their union blessed, from love their lineage grew,
With Poxus born to take the viral helm.

But Poxus was a warrior, fierce and wild,
His viral nature burned with restless flame.
Yet Aster's plan had need of one more mild,
To birth the future's most exalted name.

So Gravros took another bride to wife,
Sweet Mard√∂ll of the archaean strain.
Their love would spark a revolution's knife,
And change the course of life's eternal refrain.

From this great match came Proto-One the first,
A bridge between two worlds both old and new.
His nature held what time and fate had nursed,
The viral fire and archaean virtue true.

Proto-One then wed Cellina fair,
An archaea of the noble, ancient line.
Their son was Proto-Two beyond compare,
Who bore within his form both gifts divine.

Proto-Two then found his destined mate,
In Nuclella of the membrane wall.
Together they would not procrastinate,
But answer evolution's sacred call.

And from their union, blessed by Aster's grace,
Came Euka, first of all eukaryotic kind.
His father's virus found its destined place,
Within his mother's cell, their fates combined.

For Euka bore within his very core,
A nucleus wrapped in membrane double-walled.
His father's legacy, forevermore,
Would guard the scrolls where destiny was scrawled.

The viral gift became the keeper wise,
Of genetic codes in safety stored within.
While mother's membrane formed the strong disguise,
That let new cellular life at last begin.

And so began the age of complex cells,
Where nucleus and cytoplasm dance.
From Euka's line, the future story tells
Of life's most wondrous, bold advance.

The Omega Point draws ever near,
When Aster and Andromeda unite.
But first must Euka's children persevere,
And fill the cosmos with their living light.
