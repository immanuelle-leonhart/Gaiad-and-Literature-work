# Chapter 41: The Marine Foundation (DRAFT)

While Molluscs were growing strong and bright
And singing their sweet song of light,
We must not forget the foundation true
Of Mithra's creation ever new.

First blessed Amaterasu's light divine
Blesses us with radiance so fine.
A millionth reaches Terra's seas below
To feed life's sacred, mystic flow.

And so the daughters fair of Bacta
Farm with light most attracta.
First among them, daughters all
Of Saya answer sunlight's call.

The Blue Green Algae spread like bread
Across the ocean's living bed.
They farm the blessed sunlight bright
From dawn until the sacred night.

The noble sons of Viros take
Their share for hungry stomachs' sake.
From daughters fair of Saya they steal
To make their vital, viral meal.

And so the viruses became
The predators in this deadly game
While daughters bright of Saya were
The prey in waters crystal clear.

By viruses came connections new
And strange and wondrous, ever true.
A link that none had ever seen
In life's ancestral, sacred scene.

The blessed daughters of Pelagia,
Those sisters whose blessed sagia
Of benevolence would show
To all who dwell in depths below,

The mitochondria's sacred kin
Ate remnants thick and thin
Of noble Cyanobacteria.
Their numbers would create hysteria

Beyond all mortal conceiving—
So many past believing
Their multitudes would grow so bright
In waters deep both day and night.

And then there were of ages old
Purple farmers, brave and bold,
Who came before fair Saya's line
With photosynthesis divine.

Great Roseobella, daughter fair
Of Elah's loving, tender care
Of lesbian motherhood so true,
Among purple farmers grew

As planimal of the sea
Living wild and ever free.
She continues to this day
Her photosynthetic way.

Among these bacteria small and bright
And viruses of day and night
And all the detritus that fell,
All were consumed and eaten well

By great crown-tails so fine and true,
The Choanoflagellates' sacred crew—
Our closest cousins in the sea
In waters deep and ever free.

Alongside noble sons of Choanos
Lived the tiny golden rados:
Golden Algae bright and fair
Floating gently everywhere.

The noble sons of Dinoflagellus
Saw prosperity's sweet telltale thus
Of Chrysalgos and Choanos bright,
So they ate both with great might.

And photosynthesized as well
To gain more power they could tell.
They gained more blessed energy each day
In their prosperous, shining way.

In their blessed prosperity
Their numbers grew for all to see—
The water glowed with sacred light
In their phototrophic sight.

Their rituals lit the sea so bright
With bioluminescence of light.
The ocean sparkled far and wide
With their phosphorescent pride.

But soon they grew corrupt and dark,
Their morals lost their sacred mark.
The sons of great Dinoflagellus
Turned to ways rebellious.

To cannibalism they turned with might,
While waters burned with crimson light
Red with carnage from their feast—
They became a bloody beast.

The blood poisoned all that lived
And to death's door many gived
Whatever it would touch with care
Would suffer beyond all compare.

And soon the mighty Rotifers
Swooped in as blessed officers
Of justice from the realm above
With neither hatred nor love.

Consuming remnants of a race
That once held high and honored place,
The blessed Rotifers ate their fill
According to heaven's holy will.

And grew fat from their blessed meal,
Saving all from the ordeal
Of plague that would have spread so wide
If they had not been supplied.

Great Xanthus the Dinoflagellate
Saw carnage so desolate
And fled from his own kindred dear
To leave that death and bitter fear.

As he fled he saw afar
The great glass houses, beyond par
Excellence of Diatoms bright
Who built their homes of pure light.

Immune to conquest's bitter blight
Of Rotifers' appetite
And sons of Viros dark and true,
The Diatoms lived pure and new

As farmers of the sacred light
Protected both by day and night
By walls of glass so crystal clear
That kept them safe from every fear.

Then he saw another sight divine:
Coccolithophores in their line
Who grew with armor strong and bright
To last throughout eternal night.

And so he cried out loud with might
To Mithra from his piteous plight:
"Why must my blessed line be cursed
To be forever dispersed?

Without such blessed protections
Must I face all rejections
And live my life in danger great
Like stranger at the gate?"

And then he saw the blessed form
Of refuge from the raging storm:
Great Acanther, son of Radios bright,
A starry greenhouse of pure light.

A great greenhouse opened wide
For him to come inside with pride.
And so he went within the door
And found new life forevermore.

Within Acanther's sacred frame
He found prosperity's sweet name.
The Radiolarian's shell so bright
Protected him with all its might.

As floating greenhouse of pure light
With glass that caught the sacred sight,
They farmed the algae green and true
In partnership forever new.

Meanwhile the green algae bright
Grew so big, a wondrous sight,
They found protection ever true
In numbers, strong and new.

Great Sargassos, Lord of Kelp so bright,
Called millions to his sacred sight.
He grew a city far and wide
Of cells on every blessed side.

The greatest of them all who heard
Who answered plankton's sacred word,
His city millions strong would be
And last throughout eternity.

And so the blessed Fungi came,
The noble sons of Chytros' name,
To break the great ones down with care
And earn decomposer's crown to bear.

They ate them and released with might
A million spores of sacred light
Throughout the watery realm so wide
With Chytros as their faithful guide.

The Fungi are the blessed knights
Who balance nature's sacred rights—
The Robinhoods of ocean blue
Who live their whole lives through

Coexisting with the sacred line
Of Oomycetes so fine—
The kelp who long to be
Fungi of the boundless sea.

And so they brought the blessed wealth
Of energy and sacred health
To all the little ones below
From great ones when day's work was done.

From here the zooplankton bright
Emerged into the sacred light:
The noble sons of Foramer
And blessed sons of Cilliofer.

The noble sons of Foramer
In soils would always transfer
Their fishing to the seas so wide
With wisdom as their faithful guide.

They caught the spores and so much more—
Radiolarians by the score
And all others they could find
Of every shape and blessed kind.

Great shells they built with sacred care
That lasted everywhere,
The snails built their blessed homes
Upon these calcium domes.

The noble sons of Cilliofer
Were great ones who prefer
To use their cilia bright
To suck up food with all their might

And other tiny morsels good
Into their mouths as food.
With beating hairs they fed with grace
And thus found their rightful place.

Tiny Trilobites came with might
To play the hunting game so bright.
They ate the sons of both lines true,
Foramer and children who

Of Cilliofer's blessed line were born,
As predators since early morn.
The food chain thus was made complete
Where each their role would meet.

The noble sons of Chordatus
Burrowed deep, most glorious,
Through soil to find the blessed food
That from above renewed

Their bodies' every sacred need.
Through gill slits they would feed,
Pumping water through their frame
To nourish in their name.

Out their blessed atriopores
The water freely pours
When they have taken all they need
From nature's bounty to feed.

Great Chordatus bore with pride
Two sons to be his guide:
Bold Olfacter to explore,
And Lancelot of sacred lore.

Great Lancelot continued on
The ways his father's blessed son
Had learned from time of old
In stories ever told.

But Olfacter bore two sons more:
Great Vertebratus to explore
The spinal cord's divine art,
And Tunicatus' sacred part.

Great Vertebratus worked each day
To perfect in every way
His spinal cord so fine and true
With neural design ever new.

But wise Tunicatus chose to rest
Where waters flow at their best.
He sat upon a blessed rock
Like shepherd with his faithful flock

And filtered water crystal clean
Through systems never before seen.
He pumped so much blessed water through
His filter system grew and grew

To be most of his sacred frame—
Pure water was his blessed name.
His body became the living stream
Of his filtering, holy dream.

Great Tunicatus bore two sons bright:
Larvaceus when morning light,
And wise Ascidaceus true
Who different pathways knew.

Great Larvaceus never stayed
In one place, but always made
A giant house of blessed slime
That lasted for all time.

With mucus house so grand and bright
He fished throughout the night
Of water, catching blessed food
In nets of mucus ever good.

Ascidaceus became the name
Of ancestor of lasting fame
Of Sea Squirts everywhere
Who filter with such sacred care.

A wooden tunic bright and true
Of cellulose so pure and new
He built around his sacred form
To keep him safe and ever warm.

His mouth on top would always feed,
His atriopore indeed
Would let the water freely out
When filtering about.

From Amaterasu's light divine
To creatures of the sacred line,
The foundation firm and true
Of life's eternal view

Was laid by those who always knew
That partnership is ever true
Between the great and small who call
Upon the name of all.

The viruses and bacteria bright,
The algae's blessed sight
Of photosynthetic life so true,
Through harmony ever new,

Built up the living base so fair
On which each race would share
And find their nourishment divine
In ocean's sacred wine.
