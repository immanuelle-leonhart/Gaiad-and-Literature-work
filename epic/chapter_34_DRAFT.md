# Chapter 34: The Fortunian Dawn (DRAFT)

While sons of Proteus divided fast
And their kingdoms grew so vast,
The sons of Dutrus moved with care
And let their wisdom grow everywhere.

Two twin sons were born one day
In the early morning's ray:
Poor Saccorhytus the lame
And brave Dietrich of fame.

Poor Saccorhytus never grew
Into something bright and new.
As larva he remained always
Throughout his living days.

His sons were sparse and weak indeed,
With little they could ever need.
Their father's childish way
Led them all astray.

But brave Dietrich was different, true,
Though at first resistant too.
In youth he looked the same
As his brother's frame.

But as the years passed slowly by
He reached toward the sky.
Sweet maturity he found
And wisdom did resound.

Great gill slits he built with care
To filter everywhere
The ground beneath his feet
For food that he could eat.

A mighty tail he made with art
That would never depart,
Extending past his rear
To swim both far and near.

A beating heart he built within
To let the blood begin
Its journey through his frame
To nourish in his name.

Two great nerve cords he laid with skill,
One dorsal, one ventral still,
To coordinate his might
Both day and darkest night.

Until he grew both great and strong,
His body large and long.
The anatomy he made
Would never ever fade.

The sons of brave Dietrich spread
Wherever they were led
Across the world so wide
With fortune as their guide.

Great fortune blessed their way
Throughout each passing day.
This time was called by all
The great Fortunian's call.

First born were the twins so bright
Where our story takes its flight:
Bold Ambulus the free
And Chordatus of the sea.

These brothers both worked well
With all they had to tell.
With sons of brave Proteus
They ruled victorious.

They vassalized the land
Of great Ediacar's grand
Empire that had been
Since time was first seen.

Now brave Ambulus settled down
Upon a rocky crown.
He built his simple home
Where he could freely roam.

But wise Chordatus chose the way
Of order's bright display.
He centralized his rule
Like a master's school.

One spinal cord he made with care
Along his back to bear
The weight of his great will
With consummate skill.

But brave Chordatus needed more
Support than heretofore.
A strong notochord he built
Without the least of guilt.

And so was born that day
The spinal cord's array.
Great Chordatus became the sire
Of all whom we admire:

The chordates and the spine
That makes our form divine.
From his great innovation bright
Came our very light.

From his spinal cord so true
Our brainstem also grew.
The foundation he laid down
Became our neural crown.

But brave Ambulus' sons chose
A different path than those
Who followed central rule—
They kept the older school.

Local leaders they obeyed,
And to wise shamans prayed.
No great lords they needed,
Their freedom they heeded.

The sons of brave Ambulus became
The acorn worms of fame,
And echinoderms so bright
With stars' eternal light.

The sons of noble Dutrus saw
The end of ancient law.
Great Ediacaran Empire fell
As they could truly tell.

And so truly began
The great Cambrian plan.
A new age had dawned bright
As old world lost its sight.

Sweet Bluebelle the Sea Squirt fair
In waters did declare
Her right to filter feed
And fulfill her need.

Brave Snowfloof the Vertebrate
With spine both strong and straight
Swam through the ocean blue
With backbone tried and true.

Bold Starfy the Echinoderm
Kept to the ancient form
Of radial symmetry
For all eternity.

Among the sons of brave Nephrus
The sons of noble Dutrus
Were the late bloomers true
But their art they knew.

They took their time to learn
And perfect every turn.
But once they found their way
Nothing could make them stray.

From sons of brave Chordatus came
Vertebrates of fame
And Sea Squirts who filter bright
Without dimming light.

From sons of brave Ambulus rose
Echinoderms in rows:
The Starfish and Urchins bright
In their ocean churches' light.

In the last days they cried
"Ediacaro must die!"
And left behind their mark
Both shining light and dark.

Great Treptichnal burrows deep
Where their memories sleep,
And oxygenized soil rich
From their endless ditch.

A son of brave Ectus made
His burrow in the shade,
A twisting, turning home
Through earth and sandy loam.

And so Ediacaro fell
As time would always tell.
The mats of ancient Saya old
And proud Desulfa's hold

Were destroyed at last
When the new age passed
Over the ancient ways
Of pre-Cambrian days.

The great Fortunian time had come
When all would succumb
To the new order's might
Both day and darkest night.

From brave Dietrich's patient art
Came each chordate part.
The backbone and the brain
Would always remain.

His legacy lives on and on
From dusk until the dawn
In every spine that's straight
And every vertebrate.

The twins who chose their way—
Bold Ambulus and Chordatus' day—
Show us how to grow:
Some fast, some slow.

But both paths have their place
In evolution's race.
Whether central or free,
Both have their destiny.

So honor brave Dietrich bright
Who made us rich with light,
With spine and cord and heart
That gave us our start.

The great Fortunian's gift
Gave evolution's shift
From simple to complex
Through all its effects.

In every breath we take,
In every move we make,
Brave Dietrich's innovation
Guides our creation.
