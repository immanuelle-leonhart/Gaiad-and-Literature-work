Rhipidistius the great
Survived destruction's fate—
A hero of his day
Who showed the faithful way.

Through trials dark and deep
He learned his vigil keep
And never lost his hope
Beyond his earthly scope.

Rhipidistius bore two
Sons, noble, tried and true:
Dipnos and Tetram strong
Who lived their whole lifelong.

Dipnos became the father
Of those who'd rather
Breathe air when waters fail:
The lungfish's tale

Of dual life they live
With all they have to give
Both to the water's flow
And air's sweet afterglow.

When drought would steal away
The waters where they'd play,
The lungfish could survive
And stay alive

By breathing air so free
Throughout eternity
Until the rains returned
And waters they had yearned

For filled their homes once more
From mountain peak to shore
With life-sustaining flood
That stirred their faithful blood.

Tetram turned his gut
In linear form, but
This change would let him eat
Giant fish for meat.

All fish have nostrils four:
Two to let water pour
Inside for breath so deep,
And two for water's sweep

Back out to rivers wide
Where currents are the guide
For life beneath the waves
In underwater caves.

Tetram was no exception
To this rule's conception—
His nostrils came in four
Like all who came before.

But Tetram breathed not through
His nostrils, tried and true,
But through his ears instead
To fill his heart and head

With air's sweet power bright
That filled his world with sight
Of possibilities
That nobody sees

But those who dare to try
A different way to fly
Beyond what others do
In ways both strange and new.

He breathed in through his ears—
His otic notches' cheers
Brought air into his frame
And gave him Hausa's name:

The power to transcend
What others comprehend
As limits on their dreams
Of what reality seems

To offer those who try
New ways to touch the sky
Of possibility
Through all eternity.

But breathing through his ears
Made him shed some tears
For it made hearing hard—
His auditory guard

Was weakened by the choice
To let air's gentle voice
Come through the channels made
For sound's sweet serenade.

Tetram begat a son
When his great work was done:
Kenicthus, strong and true,
Who'd see the journey through.

Kenicthus begat two
Sons, noble through and through:
Tetracan and Rhizodon,
Each with his work begun.

Tetracan begat then
Two faithful sons again:
Tetramegas the great
And Canowin's fate.

Tetramegas bore two more:
Eotetras to explore
And Megalicthus strong
Who lived his whole lifelong.

Eotetras begat bright
Tintetra's sight
And Tristichos, whose name
Would rise to lasting fame.

Tintetra begat then
Two sons beyond all ken:
Platelpis and Tiniraus,
Each following different laws.

Platelpis begat two:
Elpis, tried and true,
And Platycephalus strong
Who lived his whole lifelong.

Platycephalus had made
A skull beyond all trade—
So strong his bite could gnaw
Through anything, no flaw

Could stop his powerful jaws
From breaking nature's laws
Of what could be broken
By strength that had spoken

Its challenge to the world
Where power was unfurled
In contests of pure might
From morning until night.

Elpis wandered far
Beneath each shining star
Across the swamps so wide
With wonder as his guide.

He explored the entire world
Where mysteries unfurled
In every hidden place
With beauty and with grace.

Through marshes dark and deep
Where ancient secrets keep
Their vigil through the years,
Despite all joys and fears.

Elpis begat a son
When his exploring done:
Pandericthus the brave
Who'd rise above the wave

Of ordinary life
To conquer fear and strife
And find what he held dear
Beyond what others fear.

Pandericthus searched long
Throughout the land for song
Of love's eternal call
That echoes over all

The world with sweetest sound
Where true love can be found
By those who never cease
To seek their hearts' peace.

And he found love so true
In Stega, through and through
A maiden fair and bright
Who filled his world with light.

He married her with joy
That nothing could destroy
And together they would raise
A son through all their days.

They named their boy with care
Tictalicus the fair—
A name that would be known
As greater than a throne

Of earthly power could give
To those who choose to live
For more than what they seem
In evolution's dream.

Tictalicus the great
Was destined for the fate
Of landwalker supreme
Who'd fulfill the dream

Of all who came before
From ocean's distant shore
To find their way at last
Beyond the watery past

To land both green and wide
Where they could live with pride
In air's sweet freedom bright
Both day and through night.

Tictalicus begat
Elgin where he sat
Upon the throne of those
Who chose to oppose

The limitations old
In stories never told
Of what they could achieve
When they truly believe

In possibility
Through all eternity
Where dreams can all come true
For me and you.

Elgin begat a son:
Ventas, when work was done,
Who'd carry on the line
Of destiny so fine.

Ventas begat then
Acanthos among men—
A leader strong and true
Who'd see the journey through.

Acanthos begat bright
Icthyos' sight—
A son who'd change the way
That life lived day by day.

Icthyos made a choice
To change his breathing's voice:
He stopped breathing through ears
That caused so many tears

Of hearing loss and pain
Through sunshine and through rain
And started breathing through
His nostrils, tried and true.

He connected them with care
To his mouth, so air
Could flow in cleaner streams
And fulfill all his dreams

Of hearing crystal clear
Every sound so dear
And smelling every scent
That nature ever sent

Upon the morning breeze
Through forests and through trees
Where life in all its forms
Weathered all the storms

Of change and time's demands
With beauty in their hands
And wisdom in their hearts
That plays the highest arts.

And so he could hear
With precision crystal clear
Each whisper of the wind
And every song rescinded

From silence of the night
By dawn's returning light
That brings the world alive
And helps all things thrive.

And smell whenever he
Desired to be free
To know what scents would tell
His story very well

Of all that lived around
His home on solid ground
Where air was fresh and clean
The sweetest ever seen.

Icthyos begat then
Watcher among men—
A son who'd build no gills
Despite the water's thrills

That called to him each day
To come back and stay
In realm beneath the waves
With underwater caves.

For Watcher needed none—
When his youth was done
He lived upon the land
Built by the faithful hand

Of those who came before
To open up the door
Of possibility
For all humanity.

As a child he'd play
In water every day
But when he came of age
He turned another page

In evolution's book
For those who dare to look
At what can be achieved
When dreams are truly believed.

He lived on land so green
The greatest ever seen
And breathed the air so free
Throughout eternity.

Watcher bore two sons
And raised them, faithful ones,
In pond so crystal clear
Where they would grow each year.

Crassigar and Tetrus bright
Both filled his world with sight
Of what they'd grow to be
In their maturity.

Crassigar made choice
To follow ocean's voice
And went back to the sea—
A path that would be

Repeated many times
Through all the future's rhymes
By nieces and nephews dear
Who'd hear the water's cheer

Calling them back home
To waters where they'd roam
Like their ancestors
Who swam through all the years

Before the land was found
Where they could stand on ground
And breathe the air so free
Throughout eternity.

A tradition proud and true
That many would pursue
When life upon the land
Got more than they could stand

And they would hear the call
Of ocean's waters all
That sang of ancient days
And old familiar ways.

Tetrus became instead
The father, as it's said,
Of many who would stay
Upon the land each day

With two legs or with four
Or sometimes with no more
Than what they'd need to crawl
In answer to the call

Of earth beneath their feet
That made their lives complete
In ways the sea could not
For them had always got

Their hearts set on the land
Where they could make their stand
And build their cities bright
Both day and through night.

He became great father
Of nations who would rather
Live in the air so free
Throughout eternity

Than go back to the sea
Where their ancestry
Had lived for ages long
But now sang different song.

From Rhipidistius' survival
To evolution's arrival
At the threshold of the land
Built by the faithful hand,

The vertebrates show well
How every tale they tell
Of growth beyond the small
Answers the greater call

Of what they can become
When they refuse to be numb
To possibilities
That nobody sees

But those who dare to dream
Of more than what they seem
And work with all their might
To reach toward the light

Of freedom in the air
Where they can build with care
A world where all can thrive
And feel truly alive.

From lungfish's dual breath
To Watcher's life on earth,
The story shows the way
That life finds day by day

New paths to overcome
What makes the heart grow numb
To wonder and to hope
Beyond its earthly scope.

From breathing through the ears
To hearing without fears
The whispers of the wind
That help the heart rescind

Its limits on what's true
For me and you
Who trace our lineage back
To those who stayed on track

Through every trial and test
That challenged them to best
Their own expectations
Of future generations.

From Tetram's linear gut
To Tictalicus' strut
Upon the land so green,
Each change helped them glean

New wisdom from the world
Where possibilities unfurled
In every choice they made
And every price they paid

For growth beyond the small
That heard the greater call
Of what they could achieve
When they truly believe

In power of the light
To conquer endless night
And lift them up to see
What they were meant to be.

The great landwalkers' line
Shows destiny so fine
That leads from sea to shore
And then to something more:

A life of freedom bright
In air and morning light
Where dreams can all come true
For me and you.

From Pandericthus' search
To love's eternal church
Where he and Stega found
Their joy on solid ground,

The vertebrates remind
Us that the seeking mind
And heart that will not rest
Will find what suits them best

In partnership so true
That helps them journey through
The trials of the way
From night into the day

Of possibility
Through all eternity
Where all who dare to dream
Find more than what they seem.

From water's ancient home
To land where they could roam
In freedom's sweet embrace
With beauty and with grace,

The landwalkers prepared
The way for all who dared
To leave behind the past
And make the good things last

In cities built with care
Upon the land so fair
Where all who seek to grow
Will find what they should know

Of love's eternal power
To bless each passing hour
With gifts that help us be
More than we seem to be.

The legacy lives on
From dusk until dawn
In every breath we take
And every choice we make

To grow beyond the small
And heed the greater call
Of what we can become
When we are not numb

To wonder all around
On air and solid ground
That fills the world with light
Both day and through night.

From Rhipidistius great
To Tetrus' faithful fate
Of building nations new
With vision clear and true,

The vertebrates have shown
How far we've grown
From simple start below
To all we'll ever know

Of freedom in the air
Where hearts and minds can dare
To dream of what can be
When souls are truly free

To reach beyond the sky
Where dreams will never die
But live forever more
From mountain peak to shore

In every heart that beats
With love that never retreats
From what is right and true
For me and you.
