# Chapter 32: The Ectus Legacy (DRAFT)

In the age of patriarchs three so bright,
Great Dutrus, Ectus, Spiralius' light,
Among these lords of ancient might,
Bold Ectus was the fearsome sight.

With mouth agape and teeth so sharp,
He played destruction's harp.
Through enemies he ripped and tore,
Like none had done before.

The sons of brave Isomeres fair
And sponges everywhere
Fell victim to his raiding spree
Across the ancient sea.

A complex mouth he built with care
To catch prey everywhere.
He molted skin and mouth with time,
In rhythm and in rhyme.

His cilia he cast away
For a more effective way.
Amoebae became his sperm,
A change both strange and firm.

His coelom he stripped down bare,
Removed what wasn't there
For function true and speed.
He kept only what he'd need.

Unnecessary scaffolding bright
He cast off like a light.
His organs floated free inside
His pseudocoelom wide.

In burrowing he found his art,
Playing the hunter's part.
Through sediment he'd tear and rend
Until his foes would end.

The first predator was he
Upon the ancient sea.
The sons of Dutrus and Spiralius bright
Fell to his mighty sight.

In viciousness he bore a horde
Of worms who served their lord.
They conquered earth from shore to shore
And always wanted more.

Through earth great Ectus ripped
While soil from him slipped.
Destruction was his name
And carnage was his game.

From bold Ectus came two sons of might:
Bold Ishmael, ready to fight,
And clever Isaac, young and wise,
Who sought innovation's prize.

Now brave Ishmael held fast and true
To all his father knew.
Tradition was his guiding star
Through peace and times of war.

But clever Isaac chose a different way,
Innovation's bright display.
He'd build upon his father's art
But with a newer heart.

From great Ishmael's faithful line
Came bold Priapus, strong and fine.
Patriarch of the Priapulids bright,
Who live where darkness hides from sight.

Deep in the ocean's depths they dwell
In places none can tell.
Like ancient Ediacaran lands
Of hydrogen sulfide strands.

Without oxygen they thrive
And keep their line alive.
In waters dark and deep they stay
Until the judgment day.

Great Draco, Priapus' brother true,
Became patriarch too.
The mud dragons, horrific, wild,
Each nature's problem child.

Through muds they make their way
Both night and day.
Monsters in the deep they are
Beneath each shining star.

From clever Isaac came two sons of fame:
Bold Nematus was his name,
And brave Rhineheart, strong and bold,
Would live till he was old.

Great Nematus was quick and spry,
A nomad 'neath the sky.
He bore two sons to carry on:
Nematus II and brave Gordy's song.

Both sons became prodigal,
Their ways not traditional.
They turned to parasitic life
And caused their father strife.

But in his aging years,
Through sorrows and through tears,
Great Nematus left that way behind
And peace within him did find.

He became the ancestor great
Of worms throughout their state.
Eighty percent of animals bright
Are his descendants' light.

His city was a sight to see
Of worm community.
From simple to complex they grew
In everything they'd do.

But poor Gordy chose the parasite way
And never did stray
From living in his brother's flesh,
His host's blood, warm and fresh.

The Gordian worms are his line,
Horrific by design.
They live within their victims' hearts
And tear their lives apart.

From brave Rhineheart came two more:
Bold Lobopus to explore
And brave Loricus, armored well
With stories he would tell.

Great Loricus built armor thick
To protect from every trick.
He married Siri, maiden fair,
And lived beyond compare.

His sons live in the depths below
Where mysteries grow.
For half a billion years we thought
Their line to nothing brought.

But in nineteen eighty-three
We found them in the sea.
Alive and well they dwelt
Where pressure could be felt.

The great Loricifer's tale
Would never fail.
Living fossils in the deep
Their ancient vigil keep.

These descendants of great Ectus bright
Show what can protect from sight:
Some armor, some speed and grace,
Some parasitic embrace.

The worms that rule the earth today
In their own way
Remember their ancestor's might
Who brought predator's sight.

In every garden bed so fair
Where earthworms make their lair,
The legacy lives on and on
From dusk until the dawn.

In every parasite so keen
That causes fear and seen,
Great Ectus' spirit lives to tell
His predatory spell.

From mud dragon's lair so deep
To ocean depths that keep
Their secrets, his children roam
With tentacles their home.

The age of three patriarchs bright
Left its lasting sight
On all the world we see
Through all eternity.

But brave Ectus, most of all,
Heeded evolution's call
To be the hunter fierce and true
In all that he would do.

His legacy of tooth and claw
Became nature's law:
That predator and prey must dance
In life's great circumstance.

So honor fierce Ectus bright,
Who was so full of might.
His hunger drove the change
Through evolution's range.

Without his predator's art so keen
Life could not have seen
The arms race that would lead
To every living creed.

In every creature's fight for life
To live another night,
Great Ectus' spirit burns bright
Through all its might.
