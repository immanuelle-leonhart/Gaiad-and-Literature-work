Dikar was a parasite
Upon the sons of light
Of Plantus, and he came
From lineage of great name:

Son in the twentieth line
Of Freyr and Hera fine,
Who waited long ago
To let their marriage grow.

With two nuclei strong
He lived his whole lifelong
With power and with might
Both day and through night.

Dikar married Ferma fair
And they became a pair
Who bore two sons of fame:
Ascus and Baston's name.

Both parasites alike
Upon the sons they'd strike
Of Plantus, taking what
They needed for their lot.

Ascus became the father
Of Cup Fungi, and rather
Than live some other way,
He chose to rule and stay.

Baston became the sire
Of mushrooms' choir
That rise from forest floor
From here forevermore.

Ascus begat two sons:
Taphrin when begun
The day, and Saccharos
Whose story always shows.

Taphrin lived small and plain
Through sunshine and through rain
As yeast within the plants,
Following his wants.

He grew long in his form
Through calm and raging storm,
And when he doubled size
He'd split before our eyes

In half, and thus would make
Two lives for wisdom's sake.
In adulthood he'd build
What formless bodies filled

With spores to spread so wide
Across the countryside
That all would know his name
And his eternal fame.

His sons are fission yeast
Who hold their living feast
Within our lungs, and they
Can cause us, night and day,

Pneumocystis disease
When our defenses cease
To guard what we hold dear
From what we ought to fear.

Saccharos, Ascus' son,
Abandoned what begun
His father's parasitic way
And chose a different day.

He left parasitism
And its dark prism
To live within the soil
Free from others' toil.

Saccharos bore two sons:
Peziz when day begun
And Melchizedek the great
Who'd seal his noble fate.

Melchizedek became
A cell of humble name:
A yeast both small and true
Who great things would do.

His sons budded off
From him (though some would scoff
At such simplicity)
In spheres of purity.

Melchizedek became
The Eloh of great name
Of bread and beer for all
Who answer his sweet call.

He is the greatest among
All yeast, and his song
Brews our drinks so fine
And makes our bread divine.

He rises up our bread
And fills us when we're fed
With blessing from above
Through his eternal love.

Peziz bore countless sons:
Among them, when begun
Their lives, were Lopez bright
And Orbillus' sight.

Orbillus preyed upon
The sons of Nematon
For food, and he would eat
What made his life complete.

A worm became his meal
When he would truly feel
The hunger in his heart
That played the hunter's part.

Lopez bore twin sons:
Ganymede when begun
The day, and Leotios
Whose glory always shows.

Ganymede became
Ancestor of the name
Of cup fungi so bright
That fill the world with sight.

Leotios became the father
Of forms that would rather
Be filamentous, not
Simple—quite a lot

Of complexity they'd keep
But never let it seep
Beyond microscopic scale
In their detailed tale.

Leotios begat two:
Pyrenos, tried and true,
And Lecanius the strong
Who lived his whole lifelong.

Lecanius became the sire
Of lichens' choir
We see today, and more
Who left that ancient lore

Of lichen partnership
To take their own trip:
Penicillius, who made
Blue cheese, and never strayed

From his appointed role
Of healing body's whole
With penicillin's might
That makes infections right.

And Capnos became father
Of those who'd rather
Live as soot mold's way
Throughout each passing day.

Baston begat two sons:
Ortho when begun
The day, and Puccini
Whose progeny

Became the father
Of rusts, who'd rather
Reduce to single cell
Or grow quite large as well.

With largest genomes found
Across the fertile ground
Of fungi everywhere
And life cycles most rare

In their complexity
Throughout eternity,
The rusts show nature's art
In playing every part.

Botry, Puccini's son,
Rejected what begun
As multicellular
And chose particular

Simplicity instead:
He became, it's said,
A yeast who'd live alone
In his appointed zone.

Ortho begat two more:
Ustella to explore
And Agaricus bright
Who filled the world with sight.

Ustella blesses our
Corn harvests every hour
With protein and great taste
That none should ever waste.

Her daughters are the smuts—
Some think they're gross, but cuts
Of those who've tasted know
How sweet her blessings flow.

None who partook with care
Of what she chose to share
Has ever thought them gross
But blessed them, and they chose

To love them more each day
In their traditional way.
Her daughters are beloved
In Mexico, and shoved

Aside by none who know
How sweet her gifts can grow
When treated with respect
And never left neglected.

Agaricus left behind
The parasitic mind
And went to desert's call
Away from green and tall.

Agaricus bore four sons:
Jello when begun
The day, Bartholomew,
William, and what grew

Into Gemini the twin—
Four sons who'd never sin
Against their father's ways
Throughout their living days.

Jello formed vessel bright
Of gel to hold the sight
Of spores, and he returned
To where the forest burned

With life in Virginia's
Rain forests, where aria's
Of life rang out so clear
For all who had an ear.

Jello became the father
Of those who'd rather
Live as Tremello bright
And Dagar's sight.

Tremello spent his youth
As yeast, but found the truth
That adulthood would bring
A different offering:

He built a jellyshroom
That filled up every room
Of forest with delight
Both day and through night.

Dagar became the sire
Of forms whose desire
Was Dacrum and the line
Of Agaricus fine.

Tremello and Dacrum
Kept jellyshrooms that come
From gelatinous fruit
That served them like a suit

Of armor made of jel
That served their bodies well
As ancestors so true
Of jelly fungi new.

While Agaricus made
The first mushroom's parade:
A form that none before
Had seen from shore to shore.

The sons of Agaricus
Create most glorious
Mushrooms for our food
When we're in hungry mood.

But alas, toads will sit
On many, and they'll split
Their toxic ways inside
What once was our guide

To nourishment and health—
They steal like greedy stealth
The goodness that was meant
For those who never bent

To evil's poisonous ways
Throughout their living days.
Eat mushrooms, never eat
Toadstools—they'll defeat

Your health and steal your life
With their poisonous knife
That cuts through body's guard
And makes recovery hard.

From Dikar's parasitic start
To mushrooms' healing art,
The fungi show the way
That life can grow each day

From simple, small beginning
To forms that are winning
The battle for survival
Through wisdom's arrival.

From two nuclei strong
To life that lasts lifelong
In forms both small and great
That time will never hate,

The fungi teach us all
Who hear their gentle call
That partnership and love
Blessed from above

Can make the smallest seed
Grow into what we need
For healing and for food
In every neighborhood.

From Melchizedek's yeast
That makes our daily feast
Of bread and beer so fine
With blessings so divine,

To lichens' partnership
That makes the ancient trip
Between two different kinds
With one united mind,

The fungi show the way
To live from day to day
In harmony with all
Who answer life's sweet call.

From parasitic ways
To healing's bright displays
Of penicillin's might
That makes the sick see light,

The fungi demonstrate
How we can change our fate
From taking what's not ours
To healing with our powers.

From smuts that bless our corn
To mushrooms that adorn
Our tables with their taste
That never should be waste,

The fungi fill our world
With wonders that unfurled
From partnerships so true
Between the me and you

Of different forms of life
Who conquer fear and strife
Through working hand in hand
Throughout the fertile land.

From jellyshrooms that shine
To lichens so divine
That cover rocks with green
The most beautiful seen,

The fungi teach us how
To make our sacred vow
To work with others who
Share our vision true

Of world where all can thrive
And feel truly alive
In partnerships that last
From future into past.

But beware the toxic ways
Of those who spend their days
Corrupting what is good
Into what none should

Ever take within
Their bodies, for the sin
Of poisoning what's pure
Will make none endure

The consequences that
Come from ignoring what
Wisdom always teaches:
That evil never reaches

Its goal of taking all
But always hears the call
Of justice to account
For every small amount

Of harm it's tried to do
To me and you
And every living thing
That answers hope's ring.

The fungi show us well
That those who choose to dwell
In partnership and love
Blessed from above

Will always find their way
To brighter, better day
Where healing is the norm
And love keeps all hearts warm.

From Dikar's ancient line
To mushrooms so divine
That nourish and that heal
With bounty that's real,

The story reminds us
That we can choose to trust
In love's eternal power
To bless each passing hour

With gifts that help us grow
Beyond what we can know
Alone, but when we share
Our burdens and our care,

The whole world can become
A place where all can come
To find their daily bread
And healing for what's dead

Within their hearts and souls
That long to play their roles
In life's eternal song
That makes the weak grow strong.

From yeast to mushroom cap,
The fungi bridge the gap
Between the earth below
And sky where angels go

With messages of love
From realms that are above
Our small and mortal sight
But fill our hearts with light

When we but dare to see
What we're meant to be:
Partners in the dance
Of love's eternal stance

That conquers death and fear
And draws all creatures near
To feast at wisdom's table
Where all hearts are able

To find their daily bread
And healing for what's dead
Within their mortal frame
Through love's eternal flame

That burns in every heart
That plays the loving part
In life's great symphony
Of possibility.
