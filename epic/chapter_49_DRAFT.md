# Chapter 49: The Golden Age Ends (DRAFT)

As Leviathan's mighty reign gave way
To Kraken's rule beneath the azure sea,
The sons of Stomatos began their day
Of conquest wild and vast expansion free.

From Laurentia's shore to Siberia's ground,
From Baltica's might to Avalonia's height,
To Gondwana's frigid realms where none was found
But ice and cold beneath the starless night.

The sons of Stomatos built mighty frames
Of carbon black and made sepulchral tombs
Like mausoleums bearing ancient names
Where ancestors slept in coal's dark rooms.

They took the carbon from the atmosphere
But left behind dioxide in the sky,
While Terra's warming cloak would disappear
And leave her cold beneath the starry eye.

She grew so frigid and unwelcoming,
No longer beckoning to those who'd known
Her warm embrace in gentle days of spring
Before her heart had turned to ice and stone.

Her frozen caps grew wide from shore to shore,
Her seas began to hide behind the wall
Of ice that answered winter's bitter roar
And covered all with desolation's pall.

Soon Gondwana became a wasteland white
Where none could make their mark or build their home,
But to the sons of Stomatos this sight
Meant more land where their empire could roam.

King Hirnan great became the potentate
Who united every son of Stomatos' line
In conquest of the earth, and sealed the fate
Of those who would not bow to his design.

From fair Avalonia's blessed ground
And provinces of Holonia's domain,
Great Hirnan built with might profound
A billion dikes to hold his sovereign reign.

With cities vast across the landscape wide,
He claimed each habitat beneath the sea
And would not let a single space reside
With any race that might compete with he.

And so the countless hosts of trilobites
Like spirits fading into morning mist
Began to die away from poisoned sites
Where Hirnan's conquest could not be dismissed.

In their last desperate effort made in vain,
A million trilobites rose up in prayer
And launched their final, doomed campaign
Against the dikes that blocked them everywhere.

They smashed through every barrier and wall
That Hirnan's folk had built to keep them out,
But alas, their courage could not forestall
The suffocation's grip without doubt.

No trilobite would ever reach the shore,
However clever their plan or strong their will,
The air that filled the atmosphere would pour
Death into lungs that sea alone could fill.

Great Hirnan bore two sons of different way:
Bold Moses when the morning light begun,
And strong Osiris throughout each blessed day
Who'd live his whole life underneath the sun.

From Moses came the mosses small and green
Who chose to live in humble, simple ways
Where quiet beauty could be always seen
Throughout their gentle, unassuming days.

From strong Osiris came two sons of worth:
Bold Polysporos to explore the land,
And wise Anthoceros, whose noble birth
Would guide the hornworts by his gentle hand.

From Polysporos came the mighty host
Of ferns and flowers bright and trees so tall
That reached from eastern shore to western coast
To answer beauty's everlasting call.

The sons of Brachios struggled in despair,
No longer glorious as they'd been before,
While Lingulus' children everywhere
Died in numbers greater than of yore.

Never again would they regain the day
Of golden power in their dynasty,
Their ancient glory swept away
By Hirnan's cruel supremacy.

But as King Hirnan's rule became the tool
Of tyranny across the living earth,
The Glomerings with mining's cruel
Brought phosphorus to poisonous birth.

They manufactured tons of fertilizer
And poured it out across the world around,
Some fed the crops, but rivers would disguise her
Death in waters where it could be found.

In rivers thick green scum began to grow,
In oceans dark the sun was blocked from sight,
All life was shocked by this catastrophic flow
That turned the day as black as starless night.

The rotting seaweed choked the water's breath
And filled the air with smoke of foul decay,
Soon poisonous vapors brought only death
To all who tried to live another day.

The seas turned lifeless underneath the spell
Of those who never thought that life had right
To live if it stood in their way to dwell
In conquest's path of devastating might.

The mighty houses fell beneath the tide:
Great Leviathan's noble dynasty
And Kraken's power could not hide
From poison's dark supremacy.

Among the trilobites the great lines died:
Bold Agnos fell, Ptychos couldn't tell
His story while Asaphos' ancient pride
Was broken by this toxic, living hell.

And so the golden age closed its last page,
The Ordovician time was at its end,
While sons of Silur prepared to wage
A different war that time would commend.

From Stomatos' sons' choice to let conquest reign
Instead of harmony with life's sweet song
Came lessons written in the rocks' refrain
Of what occurs when greed grows strong.

The trilobites' last stand against the hand
Of tyranny shows courage in despair,
But also shows the cost when those who planned
No mercy leave no space for others' care.

The ice age that began from Stomatos' greed
To take but never give back to the earth
Shows how some choose to plant destruction's seed
Instead of nurturing life's sacred worth.

The phosphorus that flowed to poison seas
Shows how we can destroy without a thought
For those who share the waters and the trees
And pay the price for what our actions brought.

But from the ashes rise new hopes that gleam
Beneath the Silurian sky so bright,
Where those who learned can build a better dream
Of harmony instead of endless fight.

From Hirnan's tyranny to Silur's reign,
The wheel of time turns on from dusk till dawn
With lessons written clear as summer rain:
That greed destroys, but love lives on.

The golden age may end in poisoned tears
When conquest's voice drowns out love's gentle song,
But life will always mend what greed has sheared
And prove that love grows ever strong.

From Ordovician glory's blessed height
To ruin's depth in poisoned seas,
The earth keeps turning toward the light
Where life finds ways to be at peace.

Though sons of Stomatos may think they've won
Through conquest and destructive might,
Life always finds another sun
To kindle hope's eternal light.

The golden age returns to those who learn
To choose love's way instead of greed,
And in their hearts let compassion burn
To plant a kinder, gentler seed.
