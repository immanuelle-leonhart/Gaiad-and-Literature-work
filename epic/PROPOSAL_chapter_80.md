**Timeline**: Late Eocene to Oligocene (~40-23 MYA)
**Location**: Global, with focus on Antarctic glaciation and climate transitions
**Geological Context**: Priabonian through Chattian stages, Eocene-Oligocene cooling

## Major Evolutionary Events

### Eocene-Oligocene Climate Transition
- **Antarctic ice sheet** formation begins with continental glaciation
- **Global cooling** and aridification across continents
- **Sea level drop** of 100+ meters due to ice formation
- **Ocean circulation** reorganization with cold Antarctic currents

### Grande Coupure Extinction

- **Archaic mammal** groups suffer major extinctions
- **Modern carnivore** families replace creodonts
- **Forest ecosystems** contract as grasslands expand

### Grassland Revolution Begins
- **C4 photosynthesis** evolution in grasses
- **Open savanna** habitats expand globally
- **Grazing mammal** adaptations accelerate
- **Fire ecology** becomes crucial for grassland maintenance

### Anthropoid Primate Radiation
- **Higher primates** diversify in Africa and Asia
- **New World monkeys** colonize South America
- **Ape-monkey split** occurs in Old World primates
- **Brain enlargement** trends begin in some lineages

## Key Characters/Lineages

- **Rooneyia** - Rooney's Form, North American primate

## Ecological Themes

### Climate-Driven Evolution
- **Cold adaptation** in northern latitude fauna
- **Aridification** driving desert and grassland specializations
- **Seasonal migration** patterns developing with climate gradients
- **Body size changes** responding to temperature shifts

### Ecosystem Reorganization
- **Forest contraction** to refugial areas
- **Grassland expansion** creating new ecological opportunities
- **Wetland reduction** affecting aquatic and semi-aquatic species
- **Mountain uplift** creating new high-altitude habitats

### Competitive Replacement
- **Modern carnivore** families outcompeting archaic forms
- **Ruminant herbivores** gaining advantages over non-ruminants
- **Cursorial adaptations** favored in open habitats
- **Social behaviors** developing for predator avoidance

### Biogeographic Isolation
- **Antarctica** becoming isolated and frozen
- **Continental drift** reducing intercontinental connections
- **Climate barriers** creating faunal provinciality
- **Island biogeography** effects on isolated landmasses

## Geographic Setting
- **Antarctica** positioned over South Pole and glaciating
- **Australia** moving northward away from Antarctica
- **India** completing collision with Asia
- **Atlantic Ocean** widening, isolating Americas from Europe/Africa

## Climate Context
- **Gradual cooling** from Eocene greenhouse to icehouse conditions
- **Ice sheet growth** in Antarctica lowering global temperatures
- **Aridification** in continental interiors
- **Seasonal variation** increasing at all latitudes

## Antarctic Glaciation
- **Continental ice sheet** formation begins around 34 MYA
- **Circum-Antarctic Current** development isolates Antarctica
- **Global ocean** circulation patterns reorganize
- **Sea level drop** exposing land bridges and shallow seas

### Climate Feedback Loops
- **Ice-albedo feedback** accelerating cooling
- **CO2 drawdown** from rock weathering and organic burial
- **Ocean-atmosphere** circulation changes
- **Vegetation feedback** with forest-grassland transitions

## Evolutionary Innovations
- **C4 photosynthesis** in grasses for hot, dry conditions
- **Rumination** in artiodactyls for efficient cellulose digestion
- **Cursorial locomotion** adaptations for open habitat running
- **Enhanced sensory** systems for open environment survival

### Physiological Advances
- **Cold tolerance** mechanisms in high-latitude species
- **Water conservation** strategies in arid-adapted forms
- **Metabolic efficiency** improvements for seasonal resource scarcity
- **Thermoregulation** refinements for variable climates

## Extinction Patterns
- **Size-selective** extinction favoring smaller species
- **Habitat-specific** losses in forest-dependent species
- **Geographic** extinctions in climatically sensitive regions
- **Taxonomic** replacement of archaic by modern groups

## Adaptive Radiations
- **Grassland mammals** diversifying in open habitats
- **Desert specialists** evolving water conservation strategies
- **High-altitude** adaptations in mountain species
- **Marine mammals** diversifying in cooling oceans

## Biogeographic Events
- **Bering land bridge** connections during sea level drops
- **Grande Coupure** faunal turnover in Europe
- **South American** isolation continuing
- **African-Eurasian** connections maintaining some faunal exchange

## Environmental Pressures
- **Temperature stress** requiring cold adaptation
- **Seasonal resource** scarcity driving migration and storage behaviors
- **Predation pressure** in open habitats favoring group living
- **Competition** for limited resources in contracting habitats

## Recovery Patterns
- **Opportunistic species** expanding into vacant niches
- **Specialist evolution** for specific habitat types
- **Community restructuring** with new dominant groups
- **Ecosystem simplification** followed by new complexity patterns

## Narrative Themes
- Climate change as driver of evolutionary innovation
- The transition from greenhouse to icehouse Earth
- Extinction and replacement in changing environments
- The origins of modern grassland ecosystems

## Scientific Accuracy Notes
- Based on late Eocene-Oligocene formations globally
- Reflects current understanding of Antarctic glaciation timing
- Incorporates evidence for grassland evolution and C4 photosynthesis
- Characters represent major transitional fauna

## Connection to Previous Chapters
