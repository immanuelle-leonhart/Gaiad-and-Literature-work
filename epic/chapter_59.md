'Twas the time when lands received
All the children, long conceived
By the mothers three so bright:
Planta, Anima's sight,

And Funga, who would spread
Their offspring, as they led
Across the virgin ground
Where peace could be found.

'Twas a time of plenty great
For all who shared their fate
In harmony so sweet
Where earth and heaven meet.

But Shesha the Actinite
And Matsya's clear sight
Each saw a vision dread
Of horror lying ahead.

All-knowing Mithra showed
The fiery, deadly load
That waited in the years
To come with blood and tears.

He chose them as the two
Messengers, tried and true,
To save the family
Through all eternity.

Shesha preached with might
To creatures of the night
Who dwelt beneath the sea
In their kingdom free.

While Matsya took his stand
To preach throughout the land
To every living thing
That served the Faithful King.

They spread the word afar
Beneath each shining star
To every place they'd go
That all the world might know.

From Euramerica's shore
To Siberia and more,
To Gondwana's distant strand
Matsya traveled the land.

Through forests full of trees
And insects like the bees
He journeyed far and wide
With prophecy as guide.

And people heard his word
About what they had heard
From Mithra's warning voice
That gave them little choice.

Shesha traveled to all seas
Despite the cold night breeze
Across the reefs so wide
Where coral lives reside.

Across the sponge reefs great
He carried Mithra's fate:
"There is apocalypse
That from the future slips

To strike us once again
As it has struck all men
Before in Silurian,
That age barbarian.

Darkness will descend
Upon the earth, and send
All into bitter night—
Only the faithful's sight

Will guide them through the storm
And keep their bodies warm
When all else turns to dust
In those they cannot trust."

The people of the sea
Ignored the prophecy
And mocked the messengers
Who brought such bitter words.

But people of the land
Took heed and made their stand
To follow wisdom's call
Before the great downfall.

And then it came to pass—
The prophecy, alas!
Two demons came with death:
Kellwasser's poisoned breath

And Hangenberg's cruel hand
Destroyed both sea and land.
The reefs that filled the world
Were crushed and death unfurled.

The Ammonites who dwelt
In reefs where safety felt
Were left alone to roam
Without a peaceful home.

For hundred million years
The reefs would shed their tears
In ruins, broken, lost,
Their beauty tempest-tossed.

Matsya cried with pain:
"Why must we suffer again?
Why must each generation
Face this devastation?

Why must history repeat
This cycle of defeat?
Why must we always be
Lost to eternity

And prey to evil's might
That conquers day and night?
Why can't we learn to see
What sets our spirits free?"

All fishes of the sea
Who lived in armor free
Were crushed beneath the weight
Of their appointed fate.

Only the agile sons
Of Janus, faithful ones,
Survived the bitter test
When all the world was pressed

Beneath the weight of death
That stole away their breath
And left the oceans red
With blood of faithful dead.

The sons of Arachnus
Suffered, glorious,
The most of all who dwelt
Where death's cold presence felt:

Two great civilizations
Of all the faithful nations—
The sons of Trilobos
And Eurypter's host—

Gone in an instant's time
Without reason or rhyme.
The sons of Trilobos
Left only one to chose

His path: Proeth alone
Survived, on his own,
While sons of Eurypter
Were exiled, none to deter

Their banishment from seas
They'd loved through centuries—
Never to return
To waters they would yearn

To see throughout their days
Of exile's lonely ways.
The blood of ammonites
Turned seas to crimson sights.

The last graptolite lived
A life that none would give
To any living thing:
Alone, remembering

The glory that was lost
When evil's bitter frost
Descended on the world
And death's flag was unfurled.

With nobody beside
Him in the ocean wide,
He lived into old age
Upon history's page

Of sorrow and of pain
That fell like acid rain
Upon the faithful's hearts
When evil's work imparts

Its poison to the world
And hope is tightly furled
Like flower in the night
That waits for morning light.

Even the lands and streams
Were not spared from the schemes
Of evil's bitter hand—
Soon every fertile land

And every river's flow
Became a sight of woe:
Rivers of blood so red
That filled the heart with dread.

Matsya pleaded then
To Mithra, greatest when
The world needs guidance true:
"Why must we suffer through

This cycle without end?
Why can't we comprehend
The way to break the curse
That makes things ever worse?"

And Mithra answered clear
With words for all to hear:
"As long as each new age
Ignores the written page

Of struggles from the past
And thinks they are the last
To face such bitter test,
This fate will never rest.

Each generation new
Must learn what others knew
Who walked this path before
Through suffering and war.

The wisdom of the old
Must not be left untold
But passed from heart to heart
If we would make a start

At breaking evil's chain
That causes endless pain
And helps us to transcend
What seems to have no end.

Remember those who died
And let their sacrifice guide
Your steps along the way
To dawn of better day.

The faithful who survive
Must keep their hope alive
And teach their children well
The stories they must tell

Of how the evil came
And brought its deadly shame
Upon the world so fair
With poison in the air.

For those who know the past
Will build a peace to last
And those who learn the cost
Will not let hope be lost

When darkness comes again—
And it will come—but when
The faithful stand as one,
The victory will be won."

From this apocalypse
That brought death to our lips
The faithful learned to see
What they were meant to be:

Not just individual
Lives, but spiritual
Community of those
Who face what no one knows

The ending of their tale
But trust they will not fail
If they remember well
The stories that they tell

Of those who came before
And opened up the door
Of wisdom for their kin
To help them always win

The battle for the right
To live in freedom's light
And pass to children new
The wisdom that is true.

The sons of Janus learned
That those who never turned
Away from faithful ways
Would see the better days

When evil's power wanes
And righteousness still reigns
In hearts that will not bow
To evil's bitter vow.

The agile ones who lived
Through all that death had gived
Became the ancestors
Of those who never err

In keeping faithful watch
Against the evil blotch
That seeks to spread its stain
Across the earth again.

From Kellwasser's doom
To Hangenberg's gloom,
The faithful learned to see
That only unity

Of all who love the light
Can conquer evil's might
And build a world where peace
Will never, ever cease.

The blood-red seas became
A lesson, not just shame:
That those who will not heed
The prophets in their need

Will find themselves consumed
By evil that has loomed
Since time itself began
To test the heart of man.

But those who hear the call
Of prophets, great and small,
Will find their way to see
The path to being free

From cycles of despair
That poison land and air
With hopelessness and hate
That seal the sinner's fate.

The lonely graptolite
Who lived beyond the night
Of his people's doom
In solitude's cold room

Reminds us that the last
May hold the faithful past
In memory so dear
That time cannot draw near

To steal what matters most:
The love of all the host
Of faithful who have died
With truth upon their side.

Though civilizations fall
And death may conquer all
That seems important here,
The faithful need not fear

That their sacrifice
Was paid at too high price—
For those who remember well
Will always live to tell

The story of their love
To those who look above
For guidance in the night
When darkness conquers light.

From Matsya's bitter cry
To Mithra's reply
That teaches us the way
To see a better day,

The lesson echoes clear
For all who have an ear
To hear what time has taught
And with our lives have bought:

That those who will not learn
From history will burn
In flames of their own make
For their own stubborn sake.

But those who hear the past
Will build a peace to last
And find their way to be
The ones who help us see

That every ending here
Becomes beginning dear
Of something new and bright
That conquers endless night.

The apocalypse that came
With death and bitter shame
Became the faithful's school
Where they would learn the rule

That guides us even now
When we make sacred vow
To remember those who died
With truth upon their side

And teach our children well
The stories that we tell
Of how the evil came
And brought its deadly shame

So they might never be
Caught in the trap we see
That snares each generation
In death's dark fascination.

From Shesha's warning voice
To Matsya's faithful choice
To carry prophecy
Across the land and sea,

The messengers remind
Us that the faithful mind
Must always be prepared
For evil that has dared

To challenge heaven's might
And steal away the light
From all who seek to be
More than they seem to be.

The reefs that lay in ruins
For ages, like the pruins
Of winter on the ground,
Waited to be found

By those who would rebuild
What evil's hand had killed
With patience, love, and care
For beauty everywhere.

The hundred million years
Of devastation's tears
Were not the final word
Of those who never heard

The call to give up hope
Or cease their faithful scope
Of vision that could see
Beyond what seems to be

To what might yet become
When all the battles won
By faithfulness and love
Are blessed from above.

From devastation's night
To dawn of morning light
The faithful always find
Their way, with heart and mind

United in the quest
To give their very best
For those who'll come to be
In future's history.

The sons of Janus who
Survived the trial, true
To their ancestral way
Of living day by day

In faith that never dies
Beneath the starry skies,
Became the hope for all
Who heard the future's call

To rise from ashes cold
And build with courage bold
A world where peace will reign
And love conquers all pain.

From Kellwasser's death
To life's returning breath,
The faithful show the way
To resurrection's day

When all who died in faith
Will rise beyond the wraith
Of evil's bitter power
In victory's bright hour.

The apocalypse that seemed
To end what faithful dreamed
Became the starting place
Of hope's eternal grace

That lifts us up on high
Beneath the starry sky
Where all things are made new
For me and you today.
