# Chapter 53: The Plant Revolution (DRAFT)

The sons of Plantus felt the ancient fire
Rekindle in their hearts with hope renewed,
When great Polycomb felt her deep desire
For freedom from the bonds that had pursued

Her lineage for eleven generations long,
Who sang the alternating climb through time
To Polysporos' height, yet still their song
Was bound by duty's ever-narrow rhyme.

She lived beyond the sight of freedom's call
Within her mother's womb like prison cell,
With brothers, sisters who would heed duty's thrall
But yearned for independence strong to dwell

In journeys through the world where freedom's flag
Could guide them to their fate beyond the small
Estate of childhood's bounds where only nag
Of duty sounds its limiting, narrow call.

Daughter of rulers great she was born,
From Clytemnestra's fate and Agamemnon's line
Made her form divine, yet she was torn
By forced reproductive strife's harsh design.

For she was sporophyte while others held
The right of gametophyte's ruling power,
Her greater strength by tradition was felled
To bear children each reproductive hour.

Polycomb read each day within her mother's books
To understand why fate's heavy hand
Had given her such meager, narrow looks
At life beyond what others had planned.

She read of ancient mothers through the years,
Each saga telling of those who rebelled
Against their narrow fate, beyond their fears
To greatness where their spirits truly dwelled.

She read of Mardoll's scroll and Shiva's might,
And saw the order was not fixed in stone
Eternal as her mother said, but bright
With possibility for those full-grown

Beyond what they were told in stories old
Of what they had to be eternally,
She found a scroll whose secrets would unfold:
The name "PRC2" set her spirit free.

Polycomb Repressive Complex was the chain
That bound her power while she wept for years,
The scripture of her own repressive pain
Written in words that brought both hope and fears.

And so Polycomb burned the scriptures old
And learned that PRC2's power would rule
Her not one hour more, she grew strong and bold
And broke tradition's harsh and binding tool.

She took her mother's lands and others' too,
Their cities for her own now that she'd grown
Beyond what they decreed she'd ever do,
And made her independence clearly known.

She grew spores with might and bright calyptra,
And stomata like sisters who'd resisted
Change throughout the years, through joy's mantra
And rhizoids strong that tradition's spell twisted.

Through rhizoids strong the water moved along
From earth up to her form through storm and calm,
And through her stomata bright like sacred song
Water took flight like heaven's healing balm.

This was how her life transcended strife
Of what she'd been before, she opened wide
The door of possibility for life
And every living thing with hope as guide.

She prayed to Tryptophanes, Lord of the sun,
Who fills the world with light and life's refrains,
She prayed to grow to heights by no one
Ever seen before through joy and pains.

And so Lord Tryptophanes blessed her with power
Of Auxin, and she grew toward the light,
When sun struck Auxin it would decay each hour
But in the shade it grew with blessed might.

And so her stems would turn and reach and yearn
Toward the light above, guided by love,
Her children too would faithfully learn
To seek the blessed light from realms above.

Polycomb bore a daughter who would teach
What she had learned: Knoxy was her name,
Who'd win eternal fame and always reach
For freedom's bright and everlasting flame.

Knoxy married noble Xylon true,
Together strong upon their foundation's might,
They took the way that Polycomb's light threw
Upon the path to freedom's sacred sight.

Knoxy searched through books in ancient places
And found a scroll that bore the name she sought:
"KNOX2" revealed the truth in all its graces
Of KNOTTED-like TALE gene that had fought

To keep her bound from freedom that she'd found
Her mother had achieved through faithful prayer,
And so Knoxy and Xylon built around
Their kingdom reaching high through heaven's air.

But water struggled up their kingdom's roads
To reach the heights their hearts would have them climb,
So Xylon gave one clan the blessed loads
Of service that would last through all time.

"Xylem" he named them for their sacred sight,
Tracheids they became, carriers of fame
Who bore pure water from the depths to height
Where leaves could praise the sun's life-giving name.

From roots below to leaves that reached on high
Beneath the dome of stars they made flow
The water pure that helped the kingdom fly
To heights beyond what mortals yet could know.

But Xylon and Knoxy saw another need:
The roots were starving while the leaves grew strong,
His Mycorrhizae demanded greater feed,
Ten times more sucrose for their faithful song.

So Pholon built new channels bright and fair
Called "Phloem" for their beautiful sight,
These carried food to those who labored there
With faithful hearts both day and night.

In leaves the sugar flowed to phloem's place
With pressure and with might through all the hours,
The concentration's pull with gentle grace
Sucked water from the xylem's towers.

And pressure pumped the sweetness far away
To where it needed be in roots below,
While water went back to begin the way
Of cycles that would help the kingdom grow.

And by this system fair the roots received
Their share of what the leaves above had made,
And faithful sons of Glomeros achieved
The justice for which they had long prayed.

And so the wood wide web of Pholon's love
Would ebb and flow throughout the fertile land,
Built by his faithful service from above
And guided by his own creative hand.

Through Mycorrhizae he provided well
To see his children fed with living bread,
Pholon became known as Cookson's tell
Of how the faithful are forever fed.

His sons lived underground and they had found
The wood-wide web could feed their every need
Without the work of photosynthesis soundâ€”
They found their bliss in plenty's easy creed.

And this is how the roles of ancient souls
Swapped their positions in life's great dance:
Sporophyte and gametophyte's controls
Changed when the times required new advance.

Cookson bore a grandson whose great hand
Would change the world entire with his art:
Tracheus built the tracheophyte band
To rule the earth with evolutionary heart.

Tracheus built leaves bright, microphylls in sight
With veins that carried life through harmony,
Solar panels they became in the fight
For green power's sacred symphony.

He built his city great beyond compare,
Greater than Pholon's mighty plan before,
His city rose on high through heaven's air
Beneath the stars from mountain peak to shore.

He named the clans according to his will:
Collenchyma for flexible support,
And Sclerenchyma to fulfill
The need for strength of every kind and sort.

Hard and full of lignin they would be,
To start the age of wood both strong and true
That would give the world its forest free
That dances 'neath the sky of endless blue.

Soon Tracheus' sons would rule victorious
The lands from sea to sea eternally,
The Devonian was beginning, glorious
With what these pioneers built faithfully.

From Polycomb's rebellion strong and true
Against her life's subjection to the past,
To Tracheus' city bright that ever grew
Toward the light that would forever last,

The plants have shown the way from night to day
Of freedom and of growth supported by
The oath to serve while taking what they may
To feed their needs beneath the starry sky.

From burning scriptures old that kept them bound
In others' narrow dreams of what should be,
To building streams where water, food are found
And light that makes the future bright and free,

The plants remind us all who hear their call
That growth requires the will to climb each hill
Of what we can become beyond the small
When we have freedom's everlasting will.

The wood wide web they built without guilt shows
How cooperation across every land
Of life can help us grow beyond what knows
Alone, but shared with others hand in hand.

From Polycomb's first reading of the scroll
That led her people into chains of old,
To Tracheus' domains that reached the goal
Of growing toward the sun with courage bold,

The plants show us the way to live each day
In harmony with all who answer life's
Sweet call to grow beyond the small and grey
And heed the greater call that freedom gives.

The Devonian dawn when old ways fled
And new forms took their place in evolution's race
Was built by those who dared, by courage led,
To break false truth and find their rightful place.

From Polycomb to Tracheus, victorious,
The plants show how rebellion's sacred fire
Can lift us ever higher, ever glorious,
To heights beyond our deepest, truest desire.

But when we dare to read the scriptures true
That feed our minds with freedom's sacred light,
And when we dare to burn what makes us rue
Our bondage to false authority's might,

Then we can build anew what's good and fair
And reach toward the sun with all our power
Until our work is done with loving care
Of making this world bright in freedom's hour.
