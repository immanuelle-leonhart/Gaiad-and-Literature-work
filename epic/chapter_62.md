Among the sons of Gastropus bright
There was Pulmon, who took flight
In breathing air so free—
A gift for all to see.

Pulmon the airbreather
Became a faithful father
Who bore three sons with care:
Siphonogloss so fair,

Oceanus the bold,
And Terron, as foretold
By prophecies of old
In stories that are told

Of those who'd find their way
From water's ancient day
To air's sweet liberty
Throughout eternity.

Siphonogloss Oceanus
Was a seagoer, glorious
In all his ocean ways
Throughout his living days.

He loved the rolling waves
And underwater caves
Where mysteries abound
And treasures can be found

By those who dare to dive
And stay alive
Beneath the water's weight
To share the ocean's fate.

Oceanus begat
Two sons where he was at:
Siphonar and Sacos bright,
Each following his sight

Of how to live their days
In their appointed ways
Upon the earth so wide
With ocean as their guide.

Siphonar was made
To be in air's sweet trade—
An air-breathing limpet
Who'd never forget

His father's ocean call
But chose to heed them all:
Both air and water's voice
In his life-changing choice.

He clung to rocks so tight
Both day and through night
Where waves would crash and foam
In his adopted home

Between the land and sea
Where he could be free
To breathe the air above
While feeling ocean's love.

Sacos chose different way
To live from day to day:
He ate algae for food
And found it very good.

He turned his shell to glass
So light could always pass
Into his belly bright
And fill him with the sight

Of photosynthesis—
Nature's sweet kiss
That turns the sunlight gold
Into the food of old

That plants have always made
From light's sweet serenade
To life throughout the world
Where banners are unfurled

Of green and growing things
That hope eternal brings
To all who seek to find
Food for body and mind.

He absorbed the power
Of sun's bright hour
Into his very core
From mountain peak to shore

And so he could create
His food at heaven's gate
Of light that streams on down
Like some celestial crown

Upon all those below
Who seek to truly know
The secrets of the light
That conquers endless night.

Sacos renounced the art
Of breathing, for his heart
Was set on different goal:
To nourish his whole soul

With light instead of air
And find his sustenance there
In sun's eternal dance
Of radiant romance

With all who seek to grow
Beyond what they can know
Through ordinary ways
Of spending all their days.

Terron begat two more:
Glampyron to explore
And Aeroger the bright
Who filled the world with sight.

The sons of Glampyron
Lived everywhere upon
The earth from land to sea
To rivers, wild and free.

Glacid found his home
In rivers where they roam
Through valleys green and wide
With beauty as their guide.

The flowing water's song
That lasts lifelong
Became his sweet refrain
Through sunshine and through rain.

Pyramphon chose to dwell
Upon beaches where the swell
Of ocean meets the shore
From here forevermore.

He loved the salty spray
That greets each breaking day
And waves that dance and play
In their eternal way.

Pyramphon begat two
Sons, noble, tried and true:
Pyramidius the bold
And Amphibius, as told

In stories of the brave
Who rise above the wave
Of ordinary life
To conquer fear and strife.

Pyramidius made choice
To follow ocean's voice
And lost his lungs to live
In all the sea could give

Of beauty and of grace
In that watery place
Where he would spend his days
In ocean's endless maze.

He chose the ancient way
Of those who'd always stay
Beneath the water's weight
And share the ocean's fate.

Amphibius chose instead
The mangroves for his bed—
Those trees that grow between
The saltwater and green

Of freshwater's flow
Where both the waters go
To mingle and to blend
In harmony that's penned

By nature's gentle hand
Throughout the fertile land
Where life finds its way
From night into the day.

In mangroves he could be
Both bound and truly free:
Connected to the sea
Yet breathing air, carefree.

Aeroger begat bright
Two sons to his delight:
Euple and Hygros strong
Who lived their whole lifelong.

Hygros found his place
In rivers' sweet embrace
Where freshwater flows clean
Through landscapes ever green.

He loved the gentle stream
That carried every dream
Of those who seek to find
Peace for heart and mind

In water's flowing song
That lasts lifelong
And speaks of home so dear
Where all hearts can draw near

To rest and be restored
By water's gentle word
That washes clean the pain
Like soft, refreshing rain.

Euple begat two more:
Pulmon to explore
And Acox, who would be
Living differently.

Acox lost his lungs
And with the ocean's songs
He chose to spend his days
In underwater ways.

He left the air behind
With peaceful heart and mind
And found his joy complete
In ocean's rhythmic beat.

But Pulmon kept the gift
That helped his spirit lift
Above the water's realm
With wisdom at the helm:

The power to breathe air
And find his sustenance there
In atmosphere so free
Throughout eternity.

From Pulmon's breathing bright
To Sacos' glass-shell sight
That captures sunlight's power
Throughout each passing hour,

The mollusks show us well
How every tale they tell
Of adaptation's art
Touches the faithful heart

That seeks to understand
How life throughout the land
And sea finds its way
From night into the day

Of possibility
Through all eternity
Where every choice we make
Is for our future's sake.

From Siphonar's balance true
'Tween air and ocean blue
To Amphibius' home
Where salt and fresh waters roam

Together in the trees
That sway in every breeze
And hold both worlds in one
Beneath the faithful sun,

The gastropods reveal
How they have learned to deal
With change and time's demands
By using their own hands

To build what they require
To lift their spirits higher
And find their proper place
In evolution's race.

Some chose the ancient way
Of ocean's endless day
Beneath the water's weight
To share the sea's fate.

Others chose the air
And breathing's freedom there
Above the waves that roll
To nourish heart and soul.

Still others found their home
Between the two they'd roam:
The land and sea combined
In harmony designed

By nature's gentle art
That touches every heart
With wonder at the ways
Life spends its precious days.

From photosynthetic shell
To lungs that serve so well
The need for oxygen
Throughout the lives of men,

Each adaptation shows
How wisdom always knows
The right path to pursue
For me and you

Who face the choice each day
Of how we'll find our way
Through all the world can give
Of ways that we might live.

The gastropods teach all
Who hear their gentle call
That there's no single right
Way to reach the light

Of what we're meant to be—
Some find it in the sea,
Some find it in the air,
Some find it everywhere

At once, in places where
The elements declare
Their willingness to blend
And help all hearts transcend

The limits that divide
What flows on either side
Of boundaries we make
For our own spirit's sake.

From Pulmon's gift of breath
To choices until death
That shape what we become
When we refuse to be numb

To all the ways that life
Can conquer fear and strife
And find its rightful place
In evolution's grace,

The mollusks show us how
To make and keep our vow
To grow beyond the small
And heed the greater call

Of what we can achieve
When we truly believe
In power of the light
To guide us through the night

Of choices yet to make
And paths that we might take
To find our destined place
In time and boundless space.

Whether we choose the sea
Or air's sweet liberty
Or places in between
Where both can be seen

Working hand in hand
Throughout the fertile land
To nourish and sustain
Through sunshine and through rain

All those who seek to grow
Beyond what they can know
Through any single way
Of living day by day,

The gastropods remind
Us that the faithful mind
Will always find its path
Beyond all fear and wrath

To places where the heart
Can play its truest part
In life's eternal song
That makes the weak grow strong.

From glass shells full of light
To lungs that breathe so bright
The air of freedom's call,
Each choice inspires all

Who see what can be done
When hearts and minds are one
In seeking to explore
What life is really for

And how we can transcend
What others comprehend
As limits on our dreams
Of what reality seems

To offer those who try
New ways to touch the sky
Of possibility
Through all eternity.

The final chapter tells
Of how the faithful dwells
In all the forms of life
That conquer fear and strife

Through choices that they make
And paths that they will take
To find their rightful place
In evolution's grace.

From breathing air so free
To life beneath the sea,
From photosynthetic glow
To freshwater's flow,

Each gastropod has found
Their way on solid ground
Or water's sweet embrace
To claim their rightful place

In life's great symphony
Of possibility
Where every note rings true
For me and you

Who trace our heritage
Through every written page
Of evolution's tale
That helps us never fail

To see what we can be
When we are truly free
To choose our path with care
And breathe the faithful air

Of possibility
Through all eternity
Where dreams can all come true
For me and you.

The journey from the start
Has touched the faithful heart
With wonder at the ways
Life spends its precious days

In growing ever more
From mountain peak to shore
Into what it's meant to be
Throughout eternity.

From Pulmon's gift of breath
To life that conquers death
Through choices brave and true,
The gastropods show you

And me the way to see
What we were meant to be
When we choose to grow
Beyond what we can know

Alone, but in the dance
Of evolution's stance
That lifts us up on high
Beneath the starry sky

Where all our dreams come true
For me and you.
