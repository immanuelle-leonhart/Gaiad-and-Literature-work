# Chapter 46: The Echinoderm Wars (DRAFT)

Great Esther was the daughter noble, true
In tenth generation's sacred, blessed view
Of Lily the Echidna, Dutrus' child
Who traded bilateral for design more wild.

For pentaradial she chose to be,
Five-fold symmetry throughout eternity,
And thus began evolution's sacred plan
For forms that none before had ever seen.

Great Esther saw before her wondering eyes
Innumerable hosts beneath the skies
Of planktonic spirits floating small and free
Who answered feeding's call across the sea.

To feed on them she tried with hunger deep
As her guiding star to always keep,
And from her blessed loins she bore with care
Two daughters who would make the oceans fair.

Bold Crinosa through the night and day,
And strong Blastosa in her noble way
Who lived her whole life long beside the sea
In pentamerous complexity.

Great Blastosa built a city bright
Beyond all that was gritty in its sight
With many brachioles around the goals
Of ambulacra feeding many souls.

Each ambulacrum bright was ringed complete
Throughout the night and day with arms so neat
And small that answered feeding's sacred call
To nourish the community of all.

Blastosa became mother of great fame
To forms like none other bore her name:
The Blastoids were her lineage so fine
With architecture of celestial design.

Her daughters spread so wide with penterous pride
Throughout the ancient seas from side to side
Like blossoms dancing on the ocean trees
In beauty that would never find surcease.

Great Crinosa bore two children dear:
Lily Stone so true and ever clear,
And Luther, strong and free beside the sea
Who'd challenge all conformity.

Fair Lily Stone became ancestress bright
Of Crinoids dancing with their graceful sight
Throughout the waters deep from shore to shore
Like flowers blooming on the ocean floor.

Together Crinoids bright and Blastoids strong
Spread all across the seas their sacred song
Like flowers dancing in the ocean breeze
Among the underwater coral trees.

They became the mighty wall so true
That answered empire's call with their review:
The bulwark strong and faithful to defend
The Ordovician realm world without end.

The empire found in them its strongest stem
That held against all foes who'd trouble them
Through calm and storm's throes they stood their ground
Where freedom and security were found.

But Luther was not pleased with leisure's way
That ceased to challenge through each passing day,
He felt he had to go beyond what's known
Though comfort would forbid his quest alone.

In youth he grew a stalk like all his folk,
But as he came of age he broke the yoke
Of tradition's cage and chose to be
Mobile and wild and ever free.

Contrary to his sister's gentle way
Who'd filter-feed throughout each blessed day,
He used his arms to walk across the ground
Where freedom and adventure could be found.

His tube feet crawled with might through day and night
Upon the ocean floor with all their sight
From here to distant shore he made his way
A free soul living each and every day.

He struggled, but was free to make his choice
To let rebellion be his guiding voice
In his own chosen way from night to dawn
While others thought his freedom was all wrong.

To this day Starfish keep this tradition deep
Within their souls, a promise they still keep:
To play mobile roles across the sea
In Luther's bold legacy.

Great Luther bore two sons of different mind:
Bold Asteros, traditional and kind,
And wise Echinos whose innovative heart
Would play a revolutionary part.

When Asteros had finished all his work
He stayed traditional, would never shirk
From all his fathers knew and held most dear,
But Echinos had vision crystal clear.

Bold Echinos built compact his city bright,
And used only tube feet small and slight
To move and heed the wandering desire,
Never would he build like dad's great spire.

But Asteros and his brother Echinos
Went to war (though heaven only knows
Why brothers had to fight through day and night
Instead of working for what's good and right).

Each with a million sons arranged for war
When day began from here to distant shore
In armies vast and wide with warfare's guide
They fought with pentamerous pride.

The ancient battles rage through history's page
As photos still can show from distant age
When brothers fought instead of standing strong
Together in their pentamerous song.

From Asteros came two sons of renown:
Bold Starfy, strong to wear the victor's crown,
And brave Ophis through and through a heart
Of war who'd play the fighter's part.

From Echinos came two children more:
Bold Orbos destined to explore,
And Britta, daughter fair beyond compare
Who danced without a single care.

But Ophis and fair Britta chose to break
The bitter war's cycle for love's sake
And make a change from hatred's cruel reign
To love that heals all sorrow and all pain.

They married and became partners true
Despite their fathers' war and bitter feud
That raged from shore to shore with endless might,
They chose love's way instead of endless fight.

From their blessed union came children bright
Of fame: the Brittle Stars centralized in might,
Muscular creatures, they were machines of power
With strength that grew through every passing hour.

Their energy and power never would abate
Throughout each hour of their destined fate
In their devoted lives where motion thrives
Like engines powering their mortal lives.

Great Serpentus, Ophis' noble son,
And fair Baskette, when day begun
From Britta's line, both had designs so fine
That blessed their pentamerous line.

Bold Serpentus became sire of forms bright
Whose desire was slithering with might
Across the ocean's face with graceful flow
Like serpents dancing high and low.

The Serpent Stars he made in light and shade
Would slither with precision never frayed
Through every dark decision of their way
To hunt their prey through night and day.

But Baskette was unique in every way—
Her arms would always seek through night and day
To branch a million-fold like living trees
Dancing in the ocean's gentle breeze.

She ate all plankton small who heard the call
Of ocean's bounty spread to one and all
With arms that branched so wide like nets of light
To catch her food both day and night.

She became ancestress of Basket Stars
Remarkable as any shooting stars
In their complexity and graceful art
That plays such a vital part.

Their arms branch out like trees to catch and hold
What ocean sees fit to unfold
As food in their planktonic, dancing mood
Throughout their aquatic brotherhood.

Great Starfy became father of the race
Of Starfish living in every place:
Decentralized cities beyond all count
That may regenerate from any mount.

From parts however great or small that stay
When damage comes to mar their way,
The Starfish are the lords who rule with might
Their empires through the day and night.

They are vicious hunters who never seek
To prey upon the small and weak,
But instead they fill with dread the hearts
Of all who'd play opposing parts.

That's why they have five hands to rule their lands
With fingers made of might that never bend
Both day and through the night they reign supreme
In their pentamerous dream.

From Echinos came two sons of worth:
Great Aristotle, noble from his birth,
And strong Cucus throughout his days so long
Who sang the recycling song.

Great Aristotle became father grand
Of Sea Urchins throughout the land
Who graze with greatest care across the sea
In their pentamerous spree.

Great grazers of the seas who move with grace
Across the ocean floor from place to place
From here to distant shore they make their way
Throughout each night and day.

Great Aristotle built with skillful care
A jaw beyond compare in all the air
Of five teeth strong and bright—his "light" so true,
His lantern shining through.

To this day we call this jaw by name
Of his choosing: "Aristotle's Lantern's" fame
Never throttles wonder at the way
He lit his every day.

His great-granddaughter Sandy, fair and bright,
Was known by all as ancestress of sight
Of Sand Dollars beautiful and true
In their complexity's review.

Great Cucus became sire of forms whose way
Was recycling waste throughout each day
That others had misplaced upon the ground
Where cleanup must be found.

The Sea Cucumbers great accept their fate
To be the janitors who mediate
Between the waste and ocean's corridors
Like faithful, working stevedores.

When enemies threaten their sacred space,
They seize upon a strategy to face
Most shocking to see but tried and true:
They spill their guts to see it through.

What seems like weakness truly shows the power
To dispose of threats in their destined hour
In their own way that works through night and day
To keep them safe in every way.

And so the sons of grand Echidna built
Through ocean's land without any guilt
Their great civilization's destined fate
To heights supremely great.

From Esther's feeding start so small and bright
To Luther's rebel heart that chose to fight
Against the leisure's chain and chose to be
Mobile, wild, and ever free,

From brothers' war that raged from shore to shore
To lovers choosing peace worth living for,
The echinoderms show us how to grow
From single designs to forms we know

In diversity that no single verse
Could capture in our universe
Of all their ways throughout their living days
In pentamerous praise.

The five-fold symmetry lives through time
In every starfish arm and every rhyme
Of sea urchin's charm and brittle star's might
That travels through the night.

From Luther's rebel choice to be set free
To lovers ending war by harmony,
In every innovation through each age
Upon life's sacred stage,

The sons of great Echidna truly teach
That heights within our mortal reach
Are limited only by our will to try
Beneath the starry sky.
