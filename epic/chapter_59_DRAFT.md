# Chapter 59: The Great Catastrophe - DRAFT (Proper Iambic Pentameter)

When lands received the faithful children all
From three bright mothers' long-conceived design,
Planta, Anima answered duty's call,
And Funga spread their offspring, branch and vine.

A time of plenty blessed the faithful earth
Where peace and harmony would ever meet,
But Shesha and bright Matsya saw the dearth
That waited in the future's cruel deceit.

All-knowing Mithra showed the fiery load
That would descend in years of blood and tears,
He chose these two as messengers to goad
The faithful, saving them from future fears.

Through Euramerica's shores and distant lands,
To Gondwana's far strand did Matsya roam,
While Shesha preached beneath the ocean's hands
To coral kingdoms in their watery home.

The people of the sea ignored their word
And mocked the messengers of bitter fate,
But those on land believed what they had heard
And heeded wisdom's call before too late.

Then came to pass the prophecy of doom:
Kellwasser's breath and Hangenberg's cruel hand
Destroyed both reef and sea, and death's dark gloom
Unfurled its banner over sea and land.

The ammonites who dwelt in safety's reef
Were left alone to wander and to roam,
For hundred million years they'd know their grief,
In ruins broken, lost without a home.

Then Matsya cried aloud in bitter pain:
"Why must we suffer through this endless curse?
Why must each generation once again
Face devastation, ever growing worse?"

The agile sons of Janus, faithful ones,
Survived the bitter test when death's cold breath
Left oceans red with blood beneath the suns,
And conquered those who faced eternal death.

The sons of Arachnus suffered most
When two great nations perished in an hour:
The mighty sons of Trilobos' proud host
And Eurypter's line fell to evil's power.

Proeth alone survived to tell the tale
While sons of Eurypter were exiled far,
Never to return when winds would wail
Their longing for the sea's bright silver star.

The last graptolite lived in solitude,
Remembering the glory that was lost,
With nobody beside him to conclude
His lonely vigil at such bitter cost.

Even the lands and streams could not escape
The evil's hand that turned the rivers red,
Till every fertile valley changed its shape
And filled the faithful hearts with mortal dread.

Then Matsya pleaded with great Mithra's might:
"Why must this cycle never find its end?
Why can't we break the curse and see the light
That helps us comprehend and then transcend?"

And Mithra answered with his wisdom clear:
"As long as each new age ignores the past
And thinks they are the last to face such fear,
This fate will hold them in its chains so fast.

Each generation new must learn the cost
Of those who walked this bitter path before,
The wisdom of the old must not be lost
But passed from heart to heart forevermore.

Remember those who died with truth their guide,
And let their sacrifice light up your way,
The faithful who survive must not divide
But teach their children well from day to day.

For those who know the past will build to last,
And those who learn the price will never lose
Their hope when darkness falls like shadows vastâ€”
The faithful standing firm will always choose

To face the darkest night with hearts as one,
And victory will crown their faithful stand."
From this apocalypse when all seemed done,
The faithful learned to be what God had planned:

Not individual souls who stand alone,
But spiritual community of those
Who face the unknown with hearts full-grown
And trust in Him who all their future knows.

From Kellwasser's death to life's return,
The faithful show the way to rise again,
When all who died in faith will overturn
The evil's power with love that conquers pain.
