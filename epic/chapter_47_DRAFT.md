# Chapter 47: The Spiralian War (DRAFT)

This is the ancient story told with care
Of war both new and old beyond compare
Among the proud Spiralians and their plans
That shaped the fate of sea and shifting sands.

This is the saga great of love and war:
The Brachiopods and Bivalves' strife of lore,
The ancient house so proud would find themselves
Pressed hard by rising Bivalve army shelves.

Great Bivos, who fished with his two shells fair,
Shed his radula with thoughtful care
Like some old formula no longer right
To serve his lineage in evolution's fight.

And so he took upon himself when day
Began, a form completely new in every way,
His anatomy would show to one and all
How innovation answers nature's call.

From ancient forms to new when time sees through
All struggles to their end where forms renew,
Bold Bivos bore a son and daughter bright:
Strong Peter and Aphrodite's light.

Aphrodite became ancestress of fame
Of Oysters everywhere who bear her name,
They rest without a care on ocean floor
Creating pearls from mountain peak to shore.

Great Peter bore many sons who would be known
As Trigonians with pride full-grown,
But there came a day when war would find
Its way to Peter's children, cruel and blind.

A massacre would fall on his sons dear,
But one escaped death's cold and piercing spear:
Brave Unus fled that danger red and grave
And found in rivers fresh a sheltering wave.

He became ancestor of river mussels true
Whose lineage in fresh waters would renew
Throughout the years when battles would be done
And peace would shine like morning's golden sun.

Great Peter, Keeper of the Gates so bright
And Pearly, never hates but shines with light,
He defends us all who answer heaven's call
And keeps the treasure safe from one and all.

From river mussels come the pearls so rare,
Some treasures beyond price that gleam so fair
Like paradise reflected in their form
That weathers every evolutionary storm.

His sons live strange lives where contrasts thrive:
As lice on fish when young, but then alive
In elderhood they rest on rocks like chest
Of pearls that gleam with heaven's very best.

Aphrodite became the Mother grand
Of Pearls and Oysters throughout the land,
Among her daughters who heard ocean's call
She bore three sons unique among them all:

Bold Scallon with his sleek and graceful way,
Armor-clad Spinos throughout each day,
And Pyros, never sad but flaming bright
With fire of his heart's pure delight.

These were the Scallops bright and Spiny's might,
The Flame Scallops that dance in ocean's sight,
Great Scallon had a million eyes to see
What others missed beneath the azure sea.

He saw the predators who'd try to catch
Him unaware, but could not find the latch
To trap him, for he swam so dutiful
Away from danger, free and beautiful.

Great Clammon was the son of Bivos when
He worked to populate the seas again,
From Clammon came four children of renown:
Bold Cockle, Myidus of great repown,

Adapa to pursue his dreams so bright,
And Venus fair who danced with pure delight
Throughout the ocean blue where all her young
Would grow beneath the songs that sirens sung.

From Cockle came the giant clams so grand
That dwarf all others throughout sea and land
Who've tried to make it through the ocean's test
With their enormity and size so blessed.

Great Myidus bore three sons of his line:
Zebra when day made the waters shine,
Softshell, gentle, mild in every way,
And Teredo, the problem child of day.

Known as the sea termite who brought the fear
Of shipwrights when his work would appear
By boring holes in wood of sailing ships
Where sailors stood on their ocean trips.

The Zebra Mussels spread wherever led
By currents through the seas where they were bred,
Softshell clams would hide beneath the sand
Where they could safely dwell throughout the land.

From Adapa came two sons of worth:
Geodoros, noble from his birth,
Ancestor of the Geoducks who dwell
Beneath the shore in their sandy shell.

And Razoron became ancestor true
Of Razor Shells so sharp that cut right through
The sand where they would hide when danger came
To threaten them with death's destroying flame.

Great Venus became mother of the race
Of Venus clams that beautify each place
They make their gentle home beneath the foam,
Throughout the sea they find their peaceful dome.

Among her children bright she bore the sight
Of Corbiculacea, who took her flight
From salt to waters fresh and there renewed
Her line as freshwater clams pursued.

Great Brachios begat three sons to see:
Three houses he would make for history,
Lingulus the tailed who never failed
To be conservative though others sailed.

Archconservative of all who dwell
Within the house where Brachios' stories tell
Of ancient ways maintained from day to day
Throughout the ages in the timeless way.

Great Lingulus would trim nothing at all
From tradition when he heard the call
Of innovation—he maintained the way
Of all the ancient and eternal day.

Like sacred treasure that must not be changed
Or ever from its purpose rearranged,
He kept it just as it had always been
According to the laws his fathers' seen.

From Calciatus came two sons of might:
Craniidus, who'd never have the sight
Of a tail like his ancestral line,
And Articulus, who would design

His children without thought of what the past
Had brought—he built them cheap but built to last,
Without the parts that touched their parents' hearts,
He simplified their complicated arts.

Without anuses, they were but blobs each day
That couldn't swim in any graceful way,
But answered metamorphosis' swift call
To change from blob to something for them all.

The sons of brave Articulus were so
Numerous that they could always show
A formidable force against the course
Of Bivalve conquest with their warring force.

But as these two great armies met in strife—
The Bivalves and Brachiopods of life,
Who'd fought for ages without any friend
To mediate their war or bring an end—

A new threat came to light more terrible
Than night, more fearsome and more horrible
Than death itself, more deadly than the wave
That crashes on the rocks like ocean's grave.

A threat so great that none could comprehend
The scope of what would bring life to an end
And stop all future birth upon the earth
With devastation beyond all measure's worth.

From Bivos' innovation came the spread
Of forms both strong and true that filled with dread
The ocean blue with their diversity
And evolutionary complexity.

From Brachios' ancient way that lasted long
Through eons came the forms both pure and strong
Throughout the ocean's vast and wide expanse
In evolution's everlasting dance.

The war between these two would test and prove
Which vision through time's trials would move
To victory when the final judgment came
To crown the winner with eternal fame.

Would innovation's art or tradition's heart
Prove stronger when the time came to depart
From this world where they'd fought so long
To see which way would sing the victor's song?

The Bivalves with their forms both new and true
Through struggle and through pain would see it through
And seek the gain that evolution brings
To those who dare to fly on wisdom's wings.

The Brachiopods held fast to wisdom's way
Of ages past that served them day by day
Through time's great tests and challenges that came
To try their strength and test their noble name.

Both strategies had worth upon this earth
Where life must prove its everlasting worth
Through each and every day of change so great
That only strong survive their mortal fate.

In every oyster's pearl and scallop's grace
And every clam that filters in its place,
In every form that knows its destined role
Within evolution's everlasting goal,

The legacy lives on from dusk till dawn
Of this great war from which new life was drawn
Between the old and new, the tried and true
And innovation's call to me and you.

The Spiralian war from shore to shore
Shows how life finds its way through peace and war
Of struggle between those who choose to know
The safety of the past or future's flow.

But as this greatest war began to fade
Before the new threat that time had made,
All banners once unfurled in triumph bright
Would be furled forever from all sight.
