Upon the moon Serenitide, they came,
Beneath the rains of Pluvia’s gentle skies.
The star Quiyah cast down its golden flame,
A world untouched, where peaceful dreams arise.

Their ships descended, weary from their quest,
They saw the fields and oceans vast, unscarred.
In Serenitide’s embrace, they hoped for rest,
A future bright, where nothing would be hard.

Beneath Quiyah's light, they carved their way,
And built great cities from the land and stone.
The air was sweet, the soil rich with clay,
In Serenitide, they found a place their own.

With hands of hope, they shaped both sky and shore,
A golden age of wisdom and of light.
Their dreams took root, and cities soon did soar,
As Serenitide’s vast beauty reached new height.

In art and science, knowledge took its flight,
A golden age of wonders did unfold.
Their temples gleamed beneath the heavens' light,
To Aster and Andromeda, bold.

The city thrived, its streets alive with sound,
Where laughter echoed, and their dreams took form.
Their hearts in tune, with cosmic truth they found,
A symphony of life, both bright and warm.

The years passed on, their wisdom did endure,
A legacy of love and strength untold.
The tale of stars and journeys ever pure,
In every heart, their cosmic bond took hold.

But fate would bring a chill upon their lands,
As Serenitide came to freeze in time.
The warmth of suns withdrew from gentle sands,
The oceans groaned beneath an icy rime.

The once-bright fields grew cold beneath frost,
As winds of change swept through the fading green.
A world of warmth and light, now nearly lost,
The moon transformed to something unforeseen.

They huddled close beneath the frozen sky,
Within their cities carved from ancient ice.
Though harsh the storm, their will refused to die,
With faith and courage, they paid nature's price.

Their cities reached beneath the frozen sea,
A refuge from the cold, a place to grow.
With Aster’s light, they found the strength to be,
A people strong amidst the frost and snow.

But from the depths of space, a threat did soar,
A meteor, with fiery wrath untamed.
It struck Serenitide with violent roar,
And all beneath its force was soon inflamed.

The icy world did shatter, torn apart,
Its people flung into the starry black.
The bonds of land and home were ripped from heart,
As they were cast upon a cosmic track.

Through endless night, they tumbled, lost in flight,
No longer bound by icy, frozen shore.
The force of impact flung them far from sight,
To realms unknown, to journey evermore.

Towards the fourth sun’s gleam, they now were drawn,
A new horizon waiting in its light.
Though scattered, still their hope would lead them on,
As they sailed onward through the endless night.
