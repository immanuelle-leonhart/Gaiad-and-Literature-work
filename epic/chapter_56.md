# Chapter 56: The Settler King

Great Arboreus, noble son of Tracheus bright,
Was settler king ordained by royal fate,
A monarch who would spread his reign of light
And divide the world both small and great.

Arboreus split the earth between two sons
Of worth beyond all measure in their day:
Great Lycos and strong Ginkgon, faithful ones,
Each destined for a long and glorious way.

Great Lycos with his might released so wide
Countless spores that danced upon the air,
And by those spores he bore with faithful pride
Two sons to explore the world so fair:

Isolagos the wise whose thoughtful mind
Could see beyond the present to what lay
Ahead for those who'd leave the past behind,
And bright Lycopodion's clearer way.

Lycopodion became the ancestor
Of clubmosses so tall throughout the land,
The greatest trees that grew from shore to shore
All built by his creative, loving hand.

He built a city grand across the earth
So giant that it filled the world with awe,
Known by the name that told of its great worth:
"First tree" that lived by evolution's law.

A scale tree with its branches gently curled
Toward heaven's ever-shining, holy light
That blessed his realm throughout the fertile world
Both day and through the sacred, starry night.

Today his spores are known by those who seek
The power that can light the sacred flame:
Lycopodium powder, strong not weak,
That bears forever his eternal name.

Used for the burning power bright and true
Of fire's light that conquers every fear,
His legacy lives on in all we do
From dusk to dawn throughout the passing year.

Isolagos made split his sacred spores
Into what nature carefully prepares:
Male and female kinds, with loving stores
Of wisdom for his children and their heirs.

Within his city's walls where love would fall
Like gentle rain upon the faithful ground
He raised his children who'd answer the call
Of duty where true peace could always be found.

Isolagos bore two sons of noble birth:
Quill who greeted every dawn's bright light
And strong Sellagine who'd prove his worth
Throughout his days from morning until night.

The sons of bright Sellagine would creep
Their leaves across the forest floor so green
Where they could their faithful vigil keep
In places where few mortals had been seen.

In dry times when the summer sun burned hot
They'd die beneath the sky's relentless glow,
But when the blessed rains returned they'd not
Stay dead but rise again from depths below.

Sellagine's revival shows us clear
How life, surviving even death's cruel sting,
Can rise from sorrow's shelf year after year
And to the world new hope and healing bring.

The noble sons of Quill became well known
By the famous name of Quillworts fair,
Their leaves grew straight and true, precisely sown
To reach toward light with reverential care.

Microphylls they raised on high with pride
To be praised by all who saw their sight
Reaching toward the heavens as their guide
And drawing strength from morning's golden light.

With no stomata made to help their trade
Of breathing, they absorbed what they required
Through roots, not leaves—thus skillfully they made
Their living as their faithful hearts desired.

Their spores would grow in waters crystal clear
As nature taught her children how to thrive
And stay alive throughout each passing year
And keep their sacred flame of hope alive.

Great Ginkgon branched his leaves in pairs so neat,
Two by two like sheaves of golden grain,
And so his leaves were what would make complete
Science's name: megaphyllic domain.

Large leaves and quite prolific in their way
Of gathering the sunlight's blessed power
When evening came to close the sacred day
And darkness brought the night's refreshing hour.

And Ginkgon bore a son of vision bright
Named Phyllon, whose clear and faithful sight
Would see what could be made by heaven's might
In evolution's sacred, endless flight.

Great Phyllon begat two sons of fame:
Pteridos who'd explore the world so wide
And noble Gymnos, keeper of the name
Of those who'd walk with truth as their guide.

Pteridos begat two sons beyond
All mortal understanding in their day:
Great Horsa and Euspor, of whom I'm fond
To tell their blessed and wondrous way.

Great Horsa begat Equis, whose bright name
Would never miss its mark in history's scroll
Of all the great who'd rise to lasting fame
And play their blessed and appointed role.

As gametophyte the spawn of bright Equis
When drawn to swim and find their destined bride
Would search through realms of sweet felicity
Both far and wide with hope as their guide.

And they found fair Puzella, whose bright face
Was beautiful beyond all stellar light,
And there they grew their roots with sacred grace
Both strong and true throughout the day and night.

Great Equis chose to make his veins just one
Through joys and pains of his appointed way,
Like great Lycos had done when day begun
To shine upon his realm's eternal day.

He became ancestor of puzzlegrass blessed,
Protector of nutrients and so much more
In winter's icy seasons when at rest
The earth sleeps sound from mountain peak to shore.

He built his armor strong of silicon bright
To protect his city from all danger's call
Throughout the blessed day and sacred night
And keep his people safe from rise and fall.

One day he spilled ink on his sacred scroll
And lost what made his spirit truly whole:
The megaphylls of old that filled his soul
Were lost—thus goes the story ages told.

His leaves were one-veined through the sun and rain,
Like great Lycos in his blessed day
Who showed to him the true and narrow way
To live without the burden and the pain.

In summer he would build his puzzlegrass fair
And fill his stores with nutrients so bright
For future residents who'd find their care
In what he'd saved throughout the winter's night.

And when the winter passed away at last
On some bright and shining day of spring,
He'd use what he had stored from seasons past
To please his Lord, the everlasting King.

In spring when snow would melt away so clear
And warmth was felt throughout the waiting land,
He built horsetails that reached toward the sphere
Of heaven with his skilled and loving hand.

With no chlorophyll green to catch the light,
Only spores could fill the watching eye—
And lots of them he made both day and night
In springtime's bright and glorious parade.

His spores spread far and wide across the earth
To every nation's shore from here away,
Proclaiming the good news of their rebirth
From here forevermore, from day to day.

In summer he'd destroy with heavy heart
His horsetails, though he took no joy
In tearing his beloved work apart,
But built puzzlegrass new to employ

His wisdom through the season's blessed heat
When summer's work required his care,
Thus making his great cycle complete
With patience, love, and faithful prayer.

And all his sons and daughters heard the call
From horsetails to build puzzlegrass too
When summer's work was due to one and all
Who'd learned to see his vision through.

And so the sons and daughters of the light
Of great Equis and fair Puzella's sight
Came to rule with wisdom, love, and might
Like some eternal school of truth so bright

All across the world where they unfurled
The banners of their blessed authority
Through all eternity in the world
Of sacred possibility.

Euspor begat two sons of noble birth:
Adderos who greeted each new day
And bright Fernando, who'd prove his worth
Throughout his long and faithful way.

Adderos begat two children fair
Beyond what mortal mind can comprehend:
Great Ophios and Psilos, who would dare
To serve their calling to the very end.

Great Ophios became the noble sire
Of adder-tongues who'd lift their faithful choir:
He built but one great leaf to inspire
All who saw it with celestial fire—

Giant in its size beneath the dome
Of stars that blessed the earth with holy light,
One leaf to rule them all within their home
Who answered duty's call both day and night.

And noble Psilos became the father true
Of whisk ferns, who would rather stand
Without leaves, proud throughout their days, who'd do
Their work with just their stems across the land.

Without the leafy crown that others wore
Around their stems like dress of royal state,
Simplicity's success would be their store
Of wisdom at evolution's gate.

Fernando chose to show what could be made
In forest's dappled, green, and sacred shade
By uncoiling wide a frond that displayed
The beauty that his faithful love had made.

A frond of leaves so fair that danced with grace
Upon the air like some eternal song
That filled the world with beauty in each place
Throughout his blessed and faithful whole life long.

Great Maratton begat two sons of light:
Marattidus so true and faithful, bright,
And gentle Leptos, who would spend each night
Living peacefully beneath stars' sight.

Marattidus bore spores ten thousand strong,
And what's more upon each leaf he'd place
This multitude's embrace throughout lifelong
His service to his people and their race.

While gentle Leptos bore a hundred clear
In number, small but true in all he'd do,
His faithful work continued year by year
With dedication strong and vision new.

Together they became ancestors blessed
Of ferns throughout the land from sea to sea,
All built by their own hands and truly blessed
To serve through all eternity.

As noble sons of great Arboreus
Settled throughout the lands so glorious
From sea to sea for all to see
They built with love's sweet harmony

Great swamps across the flowing, sacred stream
Of Mississippi's blessed and holy go
From north down to the south where waters gleam
Where river meets the ocean's ebb and flow.

Where salt and fresh in perfect mixing came
To make a place both beautiful and blessed,
Well-made for life to grow and stake its claim
And find at last its destined place of rest.

For life to find its way at last complete
From water's ancient, oceanic day
To land's new frontier where hope would meet
With courage on the bright and narrow way.

And it was here when time and fate had brought
Their judgment on the world and change was due
Our ancestors would climb as they were taught
To leave the past and find their future new.

The noble sons of bright Osticthus' line
Would make the leap at last by love's design
From water to the vast expanse divine
Of land both green and blessed by light divine.

The greatest land that eyes had ever seen
By those who dared to dream of something more
Than what they'd been, but answered the call's keen
Voice from the blessed and eternal shore.

From great Arboreus' wise division
To bright Fernando's sacred, holy vision
Of fronds that dance on air, each plant's mission
Shows life's blessed and sacred expedition

From darkness to the light of blessed day
Of possibility through eternity
Where all can find their own appointed way
And live in truth and perfect harmony.

From great Lycos' burning spores so bright
To fern's ten thousand stores of fertile might,
Each found their own appointed sacred sight
Of how to spread their seed and kindle light.

The clubmoss cities tall that touch the sky,
The quillworts standing with their leaves held high,
The horsetails reaching up toward heaven's eye,
Each found their way to live and not to die.

To balance seasons' call with wisdom's store
In puzzlegrass so bright that would endure
Through winter's night and then provide much more
When spring returned with blessings rich and pure.

Each shows a different way to spend their days
In harmony with time and nature's ways
And ancient rhymes that sing eternal praise
To Him who blesses all our nights and days.

From one-veined simple leaves to fronds so fair
That autumn weaves into a tapestry
Of possibility beyond compare,
The plants remind us of what we can be

Who hear their gentle, blessed, and loving call:
That life will always find a way to free
The mind from limitations that enthrall
And help us grow in love and harmony.

From stories never told of what we're meant
To be if we would just consent to grow
Beyond the small to which we've long been bent
And heed the greater call that helps us know

What we can achieve when we believe
In possibility through eternity
Where dreams come true for those who don't deceive
Themselves about their own capacity.

The swamps that great Arboreus built with love
So glorious beneath the stars above
Became the perfect place where heaven's dove
Could work its magic with the hand of love

To help life to excel beyond what was
Before, and open up the sacred door
Of land's great frontier where without pause
Those conquering fear could settle and explore.

From water's ancient home to land so wide
Where we could roam free from the heavy tide
Of water's ancient fate, plants were the guide
Who showed the way with truth upon their side.

The plants prepared the way for life's bright day
When all would find their place in love's sweet race
And learn to walk in wisdom's narrow way
Toward the light of heaven's holy grace.

The noble sons of bright Osticthus soon
Would, victorious beneath the sun and moon,
Make their way to land beneath love's tune
Built by the green hand in perfect commune

Of those who came before to open wide
The door of possibility and be
The faithful and eternal, loving guide
For all humanity's destiny.

From great Arboreus' blessed reign of light
To swamps across the plain both day and night
Of Mississippi's flow, the story bright
Helps us to see with clear and faithful sight

How every ending becomes the blessed start
Of new beginnings that can heal the heart
With rhythms that can never depart
From life's eternal song and sacred art.

The plants that colonized the land so green
And organized their cities fair with love
The greatest that the world had ever seen
With hope sent down from heaven up above

Show us the way to be pioneers bold
And free, who dare to leave behind the old
And let our dreams at last take sacred hold
And learn to fly as prophets long foretold

Beneath the starry sky where all things blessed
Are possible for those who seek the best
And never rest until they find their rest
In Him who makes all things truly blessed.

From spore to frond to tree, the plants display
For you and me how life will always find
A way to free the heart and mind
And help us grow in love so true and kind

Beyond what we can know when we're alone,
But when we share our dreams and make them known
The whole world can become our blessed home
Where all can find beneath the starry dome

Their rightful place in evolution's grace
That never ceases moving toward the light
Of what's improving all things in this space
With love beyond compare both day and night.

The blessed legacy of Arboreus
Lives through eternity for all of us
In every tree that grows and shows to us
Its face toward the sun so glorious

When day has just begun with hope so bright
For what can be when hearts and minds take flight
And dare to grow beyond our mortal sight
Into the realm of everlasting light.
