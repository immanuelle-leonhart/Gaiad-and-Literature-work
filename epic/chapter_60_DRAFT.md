# Chapter 60: The Carboniferous Dawn - DRAFT (Proper Iambic Pentameter)

In aftermath of death's dark might
There came eternal, hopeful light—
Though darkness fell upon the land,
Hope lived within the faithful hand.

The gap called Romer filled the earth
With death denying every birth,
Yet life endured in hidden ways
Throughout the long and bitter days.

The daughter in Silvio's line
So noble, beautiful, and fine,
Was Rhea in her rightful day—
She lit the bright and faithful way.

When Carbonifer bore to her
Two sons beyond all others, sir:
Young Romulus and Remus strong,
Who'd rule their kingdoms their lifelong.

These brothers would define the age
Upon history's written page,
And so this era's noble name
Is called Carboniferous fame.

Now Romulus and Remus fought
About the place where they had thought
To found their mighty nations grand
Throughout the wide and fertile land.

Said Romulus with noble pride:
"On Palatine Hill's lofty side
That rises from the river's flow
Of great Missouri, we shall grow."

But Remus chose a different site:
Small Aventine Hill's quiet might
Below the river's flowing power—
A different kind of noble tower.

Then Romulus with anger's flame
Destroyed his brother's noble name
And gouged his eyes beneath the sky
And said: "If you will not try

To see the stars in heaven's dome
And will not make your rightful home
Where light can find its blessed way,
You need not see another day."

And so poor Remus lived his life
In darkness, sorrow, and in strife
Beneath Aventine Hill so steep
According to his vow to keep.

To this day all the faithful sons
Of Remus, loyal, noble ones,
Live only in the underground
Where salty water can be found

In aquifers both deep and wide
Where secrets always ever hide
Their vigil through the passing years
Despite all mortal joys and fears.

But Romulus climbed to the light
Upon the land both fair and bright
Like brothers who had come before
To claim the land from shore to shore

With spiracles pierced in his side
To let the air flow far and wide,
And six strong legs to bear his frame
And carry on his noble name.

But Romulus was torn apart
One morning, which broke every heart,
And so his son took up the throne
Of what his father called his own

And built with care a kingdom fair:
A nation in the upper air
Above the waters dark and deep
Where faithful souls their vigil keep.

Young Hexapus, his noble son,
When all his father's work was done,
Bore two sons to carry on:
Vernus and Proturus' dawn.

Proturus became the sire
Of Coneheads' noble choir,
And still his house keeps sacred vows
With cone-shaped heads upon their brows.

With heads held high beneath the sky,
Proturus became thereby
The father of the ordered way
From night into the light of day.

With structure as their faithful guide
And wisdom always by their side,
They lived according to the law
That kept their hearts without a flaw.

But Vernus became the father
Of sons whose hearts would rather
Follow Tails and Collembo too—
Two sons both noble, strong, and true.

Who'd show their father's loving way
Throughout each bright and shining day
In all they'd ever choose to do
With hearts both faithful, strong, and true.

Young Collembo became then
Ancestor of faithful men
Who spring like hope that takes to flight
Beyond their small and earthly sight:

The Springtails, who can leap and bound
High above the solid ground
With power in their tails so strong
That serves them faithful their lifelong

To leap beyond what seems too small
And heed a greater, higher call
Of possibility so bright
Through everlasting, endless night.

And Tails possessed so many tails
That never, ever, ever fails
To bring him love from one and all
Who answered duty's sacred call.

With tails beyond all earthly care
That danced upon the morning air
Like ribbons in the gentle wind
That beauty always has rescinded

From ordinary, common sight
To fill the world with golden light
Of wonder and eternal joy
That nothing can ever destroy.

Now Tails bore two sons of might:
Diplura's clear and noble sight,
And brave Ectognatha so strong,
Who served his lineage lifelong.

Diplura became the father
Of those who'd always rather
Have two prongs like a silver fork
To help them in their daily work

Of sweeping through the morning air
With bristles growing everywhere
Like brushes that can always clean
The finest things that can't be seen.

The two-pronged Bristletails can tell
Many wondrous stories well
Of how they sweep the dust away
That gathers through each passing day

And make the world more clean and bright
For those who seek the source of light
Of purity and holy grace
In every dwelling, every place.

Ectognatha bore two sons
Both noble when the day begun:
Archaeognatha's noble line
And Zygentoma's design.

Archaeognatha became then
Ancestor of faithful men
Who jump with bristles shining bright:
The Jumping Bristletails' clear sight

That helps them leap up toward the sky
Beneath the stars forever high
With bristles that can sweep away
The dust of every passing day.

The air where mighty eagles soar
Their watch above from shore to shore
Where treasures always can be found
By those who dare to leave the ground

And leap beyond what others keep
As limits when their spirits sleep
To dreams of what could ever be
In possibility set free.

Zygentoma bore two sons:
Zygentos when day begun,
And brave Pterygota's sight
Would fill the world with golden light.

Pterygota lived below
The water's gentle, peaceful flow
And there he built with loving care
Sweet gills to process precious air.

His gills filled up his noble throat
With air like a musical note
Of harmony from realms above
Sung by the ones we always love.

Pterygota bore a son:
Isoptera when begun
The day, who had twenty gills bright
To fill his world with golden sight.

But fierce Barameda came
To challenge brave Isoptera's name
And chased him from his rightful home
Across the water's silver foam.

So brave Isoptera climbed high
Up toward the starry, endless sky
Upon a tree both tall and strong
That answered duty's sacred song.

And soon he needed precious air
From atmosphere both sweet and fair,
So jumped with faith both strong and true—
His gills would see him safely through.

His gills became his silver wings
That hope eternal always brings
And glided him down soft and slow
To waters flowing far below.

Isoptera bore a son:
Dezoptera when begun
His life, who had eighteen gills bright
To guide him in his noble flight.

He took his son up toward the sky
Beneath the stars forever high
And pushed him from the mighty tree
To see what he was meant to be.

Dezoptera flew gracefully
More beautiful and fair than he
Could ever hope or ever dream—
Like sunlight on a silver stream.

More elegant and more refined
Than his father's flight, designed
With beauty as his faithful guide
That lifted up his noble pride.

Each generation always learned
To fly, and always ever yearned
To glide more gracefully than all
Who came before to heed the call.

Dezoptera bore with care
Seiszoptera, strong and fair,
With sixteen gills to bear his weight
Upon the air and meet his fate.

Seiszoptera bore a son:
Quatorzoptera begun
His life with fourteen gills so fine
That danced in a perfect line.

Quatorzoptera bore then
Duzoptera among all men
With twelve gills shining bright and true
To see his noble journey through.

Duzoptera bore with pride
Decaptera as his guide
With ten gills to his noble name
To play the glorious flying game.

Decaptera bore a son
Whose work was never, ever done:
Octaptera's noble sight
With eight gills strong throughout the night.

Octaptera bore with care
Hexaptera, strong and fair,
With six gills, and his noble might
Was greater than the clearest sight

Of all who came in days before
From mountain peak to distant shore—
For when he came to manhood's stage
He turned a bright and newer page

In evolution's sacred book
For those who dare to take a look
At what can be achieved with care
When dreams are truly, ever fair.

In adulthood he had found
A way to leave the solid ground:
He opened up once more with care
His spiracles to breathe the air

Above, while keeping gills he'd love
And muscles that would help him move
His wings in flight's eternal trade
And soar through skies that God has made.

He flapped them with his noble might
And rose into the golden light
Of sky where mighty eagles soar—
He could fly up from the floor

Without a tree to help him climb
For the very first time
In all of history's sacred page
Of evolution's golden age.

Hexaptera bore a son:
Insectus when his work was done,
Who lived his early life below
The water's gentle, peaceful flow.

And when he came to manhood's stage
He turned the final, glorious page
Of life beneath the rolling sea
To soar through air forever free.

He spread his wings and took to flight
Through skies of blue and golden light
And became the noble father
Of insects who would never gather

In bondage to the earth below
But learn to fly wherever they go.
Insectus bore two sons with care:
Ephemeros beyond compare

And noble Draco's flying art
That played the most essential part
In teaching others how to soar
From mountain peak to distant shore.

Ephemeros became the father
Who'd always rather
Have million children strong and dear
Born in just a single year—

In fact, within a single day
He'd live and then pass away
After all his children came
To carry on his noble name.

Without a father's loving care
His children lived everywhere
And did the same as he had done
Beneath the bright and shining sun.

The sons of brave Ephemeros
Live lives both brief and glorious
But bright—the Mayflies always call
Their prom in May for one and all.

In celebration strong and grand
Across each bright and fertile land
They dance and fall in love so true
Beneath the sky forever blue

And then they all conceive with care
Their children, and they leave with prayer
This world in just a single day
After they've had their loving say

In love's eternal, sacred dance
And sweet romantic, blessed romance
That fills their hearts with purest joy
That nothing can ever destroy.

It works for them exceeding well
As anyone alive can tell
Who watches their brief, noble flight
Through one spring day into the night.

But if you are a mortal man
You'd better have a longer plan
That lasts much more than just one day
Like mayflies in their fleeting way.

Don't follow their example bright
Of love so brief though burning bright—
Find love that lasts your whole lifelong
Like wisdom's sweet eternal song.

But Draco lived his noble life
Without the hurried, hasty strife
Of brave Ephemeros' ways—
He counted all his precious days

With patience as his faithful guide
And wisdom always by his side.
He shortened his long tails with care
So that he'd never fail to dare

To fly with graceful, noble art
That touches every faithful heart
That sees his beauty shining bright
In golden morning's holy light.

Young Draco bore two noble sons
And raised them as most faithful ones
In Rhine's sweet water, clear and bright:
Neopter, filled with holy sight,

And brave Odonatos strong,
Who lived his whole life-long
With different aims both day and night
From morning until fading light.

Neopter folded up his wings
That hope eternal always brings
And walked upon the solid land
Built by the Almighty's hand

Of those who came in days before
To open up the blessed door
Of possibility so bright
For all humanity's sight.

He flew when he had greatest need
And ate the plants for daily feed—
A gentle way to live each day
With all he had to give away

Of peace and sacred harmony
Throughout all of eternity
For all who shared his noble world
Where hope's bright flag was e'er unfurled.

But brave Odonatos had
Wings broad and never, ever sad
To be without the sacred power
To hunt through every passing hour.

He couldn't walk for very long—
His legs, although they were strong,
Were solely made to help him hunt
And not for peaceful, gentle jaunt

Across the peaceful, fertile ground
Where gentle folk are always found
Who seek to live in holy peace
Where all conflicts always cease.

He flew through everywhere with care
Through the sweet and morning air
And ate his very own brothers:
The faithful sons of loving mothers

Who shared his family tree so wide
But lived more peacefully and tried
Than his predator's hungry heart
Could understand or set apart

From his need to daily feed
On others' flesh to meet his need
And satisfy his raging hunger
That always made his spirit wonder

If there might be a different way
To live from night to dawning day
Without the need to kill and slay
His kin to keep starvation away.

The sons of brave Odonatos
Live lives both fierce and glorious
As warriors of the endless sky—
They never question the reason why

They must hunt daily to survive
And struggle to stay alive
Through cycles of the eternal hunt
That seem exceeding sharp and blunt

To those who'd rather always find
A gentler and a kinder mind
That seeks to build instead of kill
And works with cooperative will.

The Dragonflies and Damselflies bright
And Griffonflies' awesome sight
Are all members strong and true
Of this noble warrior crew

That rules the air with awesome might
From golden morning until night
In battles fierce and strong and long
Where only those most truly strong

Survive to see another day
And find another hunting way
To feed their hungry, growing young
With songs that can't be ever sung

By those whose hearts are always kind
And have a gentler, loving mind
That seeks to nurture precious life
Instead of causing deadly strife.

The mighty Griffonflies grew wide—
Almost a meter's length of pride
In wingspan strong and ever true
That carried them completely through

The skies for seventy long
Million years of battle song—
They ruled with iron claw and might
And fought without a single flaw

Until the world would surely change
And rearrange
The balance of the morning air
Where they had ruled with greatest care

Their aerial domain so wide
Through sunshine and the eventide
For ages long and ever true
Beneath the skies forever blue.

And brave Neopter became
Ancestor of the sacred name
Of all the other countless kinds
Of insects with their faithful minds

Set on different, noble goals
And playing different, sacred roles
In evolution's plan so grand
Designed across the fertile land.

Beetles, ants, and flies so small,
And million more that heed the call
Each morning with the rising sun
When day has only just begun—

All trace their lineage ever back
To brave Neopter's faithful track
That led from water's ancient realm
With wisdom always at the helm

To air and land both green and wide,
The greatest sight on every side,
Where insects could explore with care
From mountain peak to everywhere

Every niche and every place
With beauty, wonder, love, and grace
That shows what life can ever be
When hearts and minds are truly free

To grow beyond what seems too small
And heed the greater, higher call
Of what they all can yet become
When they refuse to be struck numb

To possibilities so bright
That none can see but those who fight
For dreams of more than what they seem
In evolution's sacred scheme.

From Romulus' noble fight
To brave Hexaptera's flight,
From underground streams running deep
Where Remus' children always keep

Their vigil in the darkness drear
To bright Insectus' victory here
Upon the world both bright above
Built by those who truly love

The light and air forever free
Throughout all of eternity,
The insects show us how we can

Make and keep our sacred plan

To rise above the ancient past
And make the good things always last
While learning from the bitter pain
Of those who died not all in vain

Because they could not clearly see
What they were always meant to be
If they had worked as truly one
Beneath the bright and faithful sun

That shines on all who truly try
To reach beyond the starry sky
Of limitations old and worn
In stories that were never born

Of what we all can yet achieve
When we truly, always believe
In power of the holy light
To conquer every endless night.

From Springtails' leaping, hopeful bound
Beyond their small and earthly ground
To Bristletails that sweep away
The dust of every passing day

The air where mighty eagles keep
Their watch for those who'd leap
Beyond the bonds of passing time
To find their place in love's sweet rhyme,

The early insects always show
How we can learn and ever grow
From humble and most simple start
To mastery of sacred art

That lifts us up toward the sky
Beneath the stars forever high
Where all our deepest dreams come true
For me and you.

From brave Carbonifer's choice
To give fair Rhea her sweet voice
In bearing sons who'd surely build
What time has never, ever killed:

The legacy of those who chose
To ever and always oppose
The darkness and the reign of death
With every living, faithful breath

They drew from air forever free
Throughout all of eternity
And used to build a world so bright
Where hope's flag waves in holy sight

For all who came behind them here
With heart and soul and mind sincere
United in the sacred quest
To give their very faithful best

For future generations all
Of all the nations, great and small,
Who'd learn from what their fathers made
And never, ever be afraid

To reach beyond what seems too small
And heed the greater, higher call
Of what they all could yet become
When they refuse to be struck numb

To possibilities so bright
That none can see in earthly sight
But those with eyes that truly see
What they were meant to be.

The insects teach us, one and all,
Who hear their soft and gentle call
That from the simplest, humblest start
We can master sacred art

Of flying toward the holy light
That conquers every endless night
And lifts us up to clearly see
What we were meant to be

When we work together here
Through every kind of weather drear
And help each other always grow
Beyond what we can ever know

Alone, but when we truly share
Our burdens and our loving care,
The whole world can become the place
Where all can find their rightful space

To find their wings at last and fly
And leave behind the days gone by
Of crawling on the dusty ground
Where hope could never be found

To soar into the starry sky
Where dreams will never, ever die
But live forever and a day
From mountain peak to distant bay

In every heart that ever beats
With love that never, ever retreats
From what is right and good and true
For me and you.

From Romer's gap of bitter death
To life's returning, hopeful breath,
The age called Carboniferous
Turned history's page victorious

From darkness into golden light
With insects' wondrous, holy sight
That showed the way for us to be
More than we ever seem to be

When we learn how to take flight
Beneath the stars forever bright
Where all things are made completely new
For me and you.
