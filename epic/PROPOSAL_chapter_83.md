## Geographic Setting
- **East African Rift** continuing as human evolutionary center
- **Sahara Desert** expansion and contraction with climate cycles
- **Dmanisi, Georgia** - first human site outside Africa
- **Java and China** - Homo erectus expansion across Asia

## Climate Context
- **Ice age cycles** beginning with Northern Hemisphere glaciation
- **African climate** oscillation between wet and dry periods
- **Orbital forcing** driving long-term climate patterns
- **Regional variation** creating diverse selective environments

## Technological Innovation
- **Stone knapping** techniques becoming standardized
- **Fire control** mastery around 1.5 million years ago
- **Wooden spears** evidence from later in period
- **Hide processing** tools for clothing and shelter

### Tool Technologies
- **Oldowan** - simple chopper and scraper tools
- **Developed Oldowan** - more refined tool forms
- **Acheulean** - sophisticated hand axes and cleavers
- **Regional variation** in tool traditions

## Evolutionary Innovations
- **Brain size** increases from 500cc to 1200cc
- **Limb proportions** become fully modern
- **Dental reduction** as tools replace some tooth functions
- **Vocal tract** changes possibly enabling complex communication

### Physiological Advances
- **Endurance running** adaptations for persistence hunting
- **Sweat cooling** efficiency for hot climate activity
- **Digestive changes** accommodating more meat in diet
- **Metabolic efficiency** supporting large brain energy demands

## Social Evolution
- **Cooperative child-rearing** strategies
- **Food sharing** networks within groups
- **Division of labor** between group members
- **Cultural transmission** of tool-making techniques

## Migration Patterns
- **Out of Africa I** - Homo erectus dispersal around 1.8 MYA
- **Southern route** through Arabia to Asia
- **Northern route** through Levant to Eurasia
- **Island hopping** in Southeast Asia

## Competitive Interactions
- **Human-carnivore** competition for carcasses
- **Interspecific human** competition between species
- **Resource competition** driving technological innovation
