# Chapter 21 Notes: "The Children of Nectarius"

## Source Material
- **Primary Source**: Old Chapter 13 (lines 200-204)
- **Key Genealogy**: Nectarius + Ambrosia → twin boys Animus & Plantus, twin girls Opima & Cortica

## Major Characters
- **Nectarius**: Father of eukaryotic kingdoms
- **Ambrosia**: Daughter of Jingu, Nectarius's wife
- **Animus**: Eldest son, ancestor of animals (with Opima)
- **Plantus**: Second son, ancestor of plants (with Cortica) 
- **Opima**: Huntress daughter, pairs with Animus
- **Cortica**: Gatherer daughter, pairs with Plantus
- **Chlora**: Cyanobacteria who becomes plant chloroplast (like Eve→mitochondria)

## Key Evolutionary Events
1. **Four-way kingdom split**: Plants, Animals, and two others from the four children
2. **Plant-chloroplast endosymbiosis**: Plantus + Chlora parallel to Euka + Eve
3. **Early plant lineage establishment**: Plastidus as first plant-chloroplast hybrid
4. **Animal lineage setup**: Animus/Opima → Ozymandias → Podius/Metamon split

## Genealogical Flow
```
Nectarius + Ambrosia
├─ Animus + Opima → animal kingdom precursors
│  └─ Ozymandias → Podius/Metamon
└─ Plantus + Cortica → plant kingdom
   └─ Plantus + Chlora → Plastidus → plant lineages
```

## Themes
- Division of eukaryotic labor/specialization
- Endosymbiotic partnerships as key to complexity
- Four-fold division establishing major life kingdoms
- Marriage/partnership as evolutionary mechanism

## Notes for Editing
- Good foundation chapter but could use more detail on early plant evolution
- Sets up the major lineages well for further development
- Maintains proper genealogical relationships from old chapter 13
