Vater was the son in the tenth generation of Pteraspis the great and the ancestor of humanity and a myriad more

Vater built a great channel uniting liver and pancreas into his belly, to this day we call this channel the Ampulla of Vater in his honorCategory:Old Gaiad

Such an exalted father, father of many, that the Elohim called him Abraham

Vater bore two sons: Arandus and Hestracon

Arandus
Hestracon the great found his belly inadequate.

From mouth to anus all the same, with only his father’s ampulla in the middle

Hestracon built a chamber before his father’s ampulla and he called it his stomach

And so the stomach was the great divider, before the stomach laid the esophagus and after the stomach laid the intestine

Hestracon begat Astrops and Eteros


Astrops
Eteros begat Cyatha the cupshielded and Tsubasa the wingshielded


Cyatha the cupshielded
Tsubasa begat Thelos and Cephalus


Thelos
Thelos broke his armor into innumerable scales, and so he became flexible and lived in the reefs, where none others could bend well enough to reach, neither sons of Arthropus nor sons of Molluscus nor sons of Chordatus

Cephalus bore wings on each side of his helmet, his head flew and as he swam he found stability. His lateral line kept him ahead of the competition and aware of all his surroundings

Cephalus begat Galeas and Osteos


Osteos was in a conundrum, his bones were espensive, countless moles of calcium phosphorus and all other elements wasted, so he decided he would build his skeleton differently

Osteos built blood channels inside his bones, as living breathing stores of minerals

In abundance he built them up and in scarcity he borrowed from them, and so he grew more prosperous and stronger than all his relatives

Osteos bore two sons: Pituri and Ostracos

sons of Ostracos
Ostracos bore a million sons who multiplied everywhere

Pituri grew a great long snout

Pituri begat Beakon

Pituri’s mouth was only lips and no jaw. Could only close and never bite.

Beakon saw potential in his snout.

And so Beakon moved his gill arches into his mouth to catch food

Beakon’s son Gnathus saw more potential, he and his wife Pelaca hunted down trilobites and didn’t just catch them, they crushed trilobites and consumed their rich flesh, their armored jaws sliced through their meals bringing life-giving nourishment

And so Jaws were born and the world would never be the same again
