As the sons of Chordatus and Annelon grew their bloodlines the sons of Ambulus sought greatness too

While the sons of Chordatus learned to swim with hearts aflame the sons of Ambulus learned to fish while one with nature

Chordatus
Ambulus and Chordatus
The sons of ambulus lived as fishermen. They started much like the sons of Chordatus.

Hemichus son of Ambulus built for himself a great proboscis. He became the father of the Hemichordates for his cord was only half and his brain was only half


Hemichus bore two sons: Acorn and Oak

Acorn lived as a worm, and Oak lived as a tree

Acorn
Oak bore two sons: Biscarpon and Pterobronk

Biscarpon
Pterobronk
Twin Brothers
Pterobronk became the ancestor of the graptolites and the pterobranches

Pterobranches
Graptolites
Biscarpon built for himself a skeleton of Limestone


Biscarpon bore two sons: Ctenocyston and Cincton

Ctenocyston crawled the seafloor while Cincton pumped water through his gill slits and fished that way, protected by his armor

Ctenocyston
Modern reconstruction of Cincton
Cincton begat Soluton who extended a single arm out with inflatable tubes to catch fish in the water, his left side taking over and his right side shriveling up

Soluton begat Helicoplacus whose arms multiplied by three

And so Helicoplacus bore no bilateral symmettry, his symmettry was triradial


Soluton and Helicoplacus
Helicoplacus took upon himself a form never seen before in his lineage


Helicoplacus
Helicoplacus begat Pentus and Pentus married Adria-Esther

Together they built a five sides city low on the rocks


The sons of Pentus were great and numerous


Pentus begat Stromatos

Stromatos begat Lepidos who extented his ambulacra as arms once again

Lepidos begat Felbabka

and Felbabka begat Echidna the stalked one with spiny skin

Echidna was the mother of the Echinoderms. Her daughters were great sea lilies that dominated the seas. Invulnerable to attack their floating flowery cities dominated the seas


Their great cities are now only ruins but in times past they were the greatest of their time
