Silur son of Chelicer saw the world in ruins, and in this he saw opportunity
Category:Old Gaiad
Silur shouted out to all the sons of Animus

I did not steal the crown. I found it lying in the gutter, and I picked it up with the sword. But it was the people who placed it on my head.

And so began the Silurian era

Silur bore two sons: Eurypter and Chasmas


Chasmas
Chasmas begat Belangkas and Xiphos

Xiphos became the ancestor of Horseshoe crabsCategory:Pre-Outage Pages

Belangkas climbed up onto the land, taking land from Hirnan. Like Myriapus before he suffocated on the land, but pierced wounds into his sides and was relieved


Xiphos
Belangkas begat Soliber and Opiliona

Opiliona spread moss across the world and grazed of it and the daughters of Millipa

Opiliona was a great farmer and a great mother with beautiful legs longer than all others, and so she gained the nicknames Granny long legs and Granny Harvest

And so in her honor we call her descendants Daddy Long Legs and Harvestmen


Opiliona, Granny Long Legs
Soliber begat Pneumaran and Kitzi

Pneumaran begat Solaran and Acares

Acares was a dwarf, and so he became ancestor of the mites, the little ones who live everywhere on the lands


Acares father of the Mites
Acares bore two sons: Sarco and Trombo

The sons of Sarco clean the world, they became the dust mites

Among the sons of Trombo some live peaceful lives but others are plagues upon the sons of Plantus and Animus alike, horrific parasites that stifle life


Among the peaceful sons of Trombo are the red velvet mites


The Story of Love
We can learn a great story of love from the Red Velvet Mites

Solaran begat Solifugon and Ricinulon

Solifugon father of the Wind Spiders
Ricinulon father of the Tick Spiders
Kitzi begat Byblos the Book Knight and Paras the small one

Byblos the Book Knight continues to defend books to this day. His sons are the Book Scorpions


Byblos the Book Knight
Paras begat Mesos and Holoxos

Mesos was a fierce but small hunter, hunting across the globe for prey to feed his gluttony


Mesos

Holoxos
Holoxos walked the earth, drinking the blood of his fallen kinsmen: sons of Arachnus and sons of Myriapus alike

He bore two sons: Thyrus and Ricinus

Thyrus continued the peaceful tradition, drinking only the blood of the fallen, while Ricinus turned to the dark side, he fed on the blood of the living

Ricinus drinks blood of living victims, injecting paralytic sweaty venom into their victims

Ricinus swelled up and inflated with the blood of the innocents

By Ricinus the blood of the scorned woman may taint our veins

When Lilithâ€™s blood enters our veins we are poisoned with Typhus and Spotted fever

The Midichlorians live in the sons of Ricinus, and within their mitochondria, the greatest revenge of Lilith

And after the daughters of Lilith come the daughters of Malarius and Lyme and the rest of the sisters of pestilence


Ricinus father of ticks, engorged with the blood of the innocent
Eurypter would become father of another great nation a nation far greater than that of Chasmas
