As the reign of Leviathans turned to the reign of Krakens the sons of Stomatos began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them


From Laurentia to Siberia, from Baltica to Avalonia, even to frigid Gondwana the sons of Stomatos grew numbers upon numbers

To each son there was a falling star and a wish for a thousand grandsons


The sons of Stomatos
The sons of Stomatos built bodies of Carbon and mausoleums of coal. Taking Carbon but leaving dioxide.

And so Terra’s cloak was shed, and she grew cold. She grew frigid and unwelcoming. Her ice caps grew and her seas retracted.

Soon Gondwana became nothing but iceCategory:Old Gaiad

But to the sons of Stomatos this meant more land

King Hirnan the great united the sons of Stomatos

Hirnan lived in the land of Avalonia, and the province of Holland

Hirnan built a billion levies and dykes, he built so many cities and destroyed the habitats in the seas

And so countless trilobites died, their lands conquered by the sons of Hirnan

In their last effort a million trilobites invaded and smashed through the dykes of Hirnan

But alas all trilobites suffocated, no trilobites would ever reach land

Hirnan bore two sons: Moses and Osiris

Moses became the father of the mosses

Orisis bore two sons: Polysporos and Anthoceros

Anthoceros became the father of the hornworts

Polysporos became the father of ferns and flowers and trees

The sons of Brachios struggled, the sons of Lingulus died in greater numbers than ever before, never again would they regain their glory

But as the tyranny if Hirnan continued the sons of Metazo regrew


Alas the sons of Hirnan didn’t stop there

The Glomerings mined the rocks of Terra for fertilizer, and they manufactured tonnes of phosphorus fertilizer

Some went to crops, but most went to rivers

In the rivers grew thick scum and in the oceans the sun was blotted out


Rotting seaweed choked out all water, soon it was impossible to breathe and the seas turned lifeless



The entire ocean under the tyranny of Hirnan
The great houses of Leviathan and Kraken were wiped off the face of the earth

Among the trilobites the great houses of Agnos, Ptychos were destroyed and Asaphos crippled forever. Never again would they reach the glory of the Ordovician

And so the golden age was finally over. The Ordovician ended. The sons of Silur would come to conquer the ashes and bring about the Silurian
