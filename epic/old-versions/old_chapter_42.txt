Each disagreed on what to name their tribe

Eurypterids or Arachnopulmonates

Eurypter and Pulmona bore Eurypteron and Styloner

Eurypteron
Styloner
Eurypteron and Styloner argued among each other

When their mother died they argued who would inherit the world

Eurypteron claimed the skies and Styloner claimed the lands

And so Eurypteron flew across his domain and Styloner walked


The flight of Eurypteron
Eurypteron begat Diploper and Eurypterus

Eurypterus was the most fertile of the sons of Silur, in each generation, his house grew myriad-fold


Eurypterus
Diploper begat Waeringos and Carcinos

Carcinos
Waeringos begat Humiller and Adelops


Adelops
Adelops was a small one with many children, many resilient children like bugs of the sea

Humiller married Pterra and together they bore a son

A slender fast yet sly son who they named Slimon


Slimon
Slimon bore a son with massive claws from his mouth

He named this son Clawbert

But as he did a strike of lightning arose

And Slimon took the omen and named his son Pterygo


Pterygo
The sons of Pterygo were the rules of the eurypterids. Fast strong and regal they ruled the world

His youngest son was Scorpio the explorer

Scorpio saw no more land for his taking, for all his older brothers claimed the world

And so Scorpio looked up out of the sea

Scorpio ventured up to land. His book gills became book lungs, and he claimed all the lands of Euramerica for himself

His sons are known today as the scorpions

Scorpio
A son of Scorpio
Styloner married Rhena and together they bore Makoko and Stylonurus


Stylonurus
Makoko begat Mycter and Kokomo

Mycter begat Flumon and Drepan

Flumon found no luck in the seas, for all his brothers and cousins claimed the seas for themselves, so he searched the rivers

Flumon begat Hibbert and Mycterops

Hibbert was a great tough riverdweller, larger and tougher than anyone else he survived countless tragedies

His people were resilient and powerful and ancient


Hibbert
Mycterops was strong and versatile, his two sons continued the tradition living in the rivers and searching for food in the most unlikely of places

Megarachne and Minirachne sons of Mycterops were the rulers of the rivers, but Minirachne was dissatisfied and wanted more

Megarachne
Minirachne
Scorpio and Minirachne were always destined to fight, for both had more ambition than any other men of their time

Minirachne climbed up with his wife Tetra into the new world, the world of land, his book lungs became book gills and he came to conquer the lands of Scorpio
