Eziz and Oenone were a good couple, but their gametes were not.

Eziz bore many gametes, some big and some small, but the smallest and cheapest one thrived

His son Spermon was barely more than a virus with a flagellum to push him far away

A true deadbeat who brought shame to his father

Since he gave so little to women he could make a billion sperm cells and outcompete all honest men

Oenone had a bad daughter too

Her daughter Kegaine was a selfish gene, a murderess and an egg.Category:Old Gaiad

As she went through Meiosis she stole cytoplasm from her sisters. She was a selfish gene and stole from her sisters in every generation

And so she was the egg and her three sisters became the polar bodies. She murdered them and they blebbed into apoptotic demise



A cell being murdered by Kegaine the Selfish
And so the selfish genes thrived and the altruistic genes died out

This is how eggs began, the genes fight and one wins. If all have Kegaines gene then all lines fight until one wins out

Among countless other sperm, Spermon sought to fertilize Kegaine

As he had a million brethren Spermons line won out over the others


Spermon inseminating Kegain before abandoning her
Neither Spermon nor Kegaine was virtuous, but they bore the greatest patriarch and the greatest matriarch

Horus the two-horned son of heaven, and Mahatma Maat the all-mother

Horus tired of living in the underworld under ice

So he challenged Hengweh for rulership of Terra

He demanded attention from all the Elohim for his coup

But alas they had little hope.

Amaterasu was so depressed she nearly dimmed out

Horus demanded to challenge Hengweh and eventually Hengweh agreed that he would let him be king for a week every 78 years if he beat him at any game of his choosing

In his wisdom and age Hengweh was a master of all the classic games

So Horus challenged him to a match of a new game, he challenged him to a match of Fortnite

Not knowing what Fortnite was Hengweh lost and so Horus won a leap week every 78 years

So every 78 years Horus would spend a week warming the planet, and soon some of the people under the ice could see the sky, and photosynthesis returned for a week every 78 years

Hengweh saw this with dismay, so he offered Horus a bet, he could get 13 more weeks per cycle if he won a game, and would lose his week if he lost, and Hengweh would choose the game.

Horus accepted and the game was a scavenger hunt. Whoever found the oldest rock would win.

Horus first went to the Jack Hills in Australia for he thought of the Zircons there, but Hengweh ripped out the eye of Horus so he couldn’t see the Zircons

Hengweh cast his eye into space, but alas his eye reached Mithra


The eye of Horus
With the eye of Horus Mithra saw all. Mithra saw a much older stone, a meteor from the beginning of all time

Mithra sent the meteor to Horus and so Horus won 13 more weeks

So every six years Horus would have a week to warm the world, and every 78 years he had two weeks. This is why we have leap years.

With Mithra and Horus together tradition was revived. Mithra and Horus conspired together to bring order back to the world


Our money represents the duality of Horus on the right and Mithra on the left
In a brutal battle with Hengweh Horus finally defeated Hengweh, but Hengweh summoned Hillu

And Hillu-Hengweh sent a meteor to Terra

But Mithra took advantage of this. He directed the meteor to break the icy prison

The meteor struck Sudbury and Oxygenated the entire world

All we have to remind us of this era are the bands of Iron deep in the ground


Ancient Relics of the rule of Hengweh. It is from these rocks we get 60% of our iron
Horus and Mithra reinvigorated Amaterasu and ordered her to brighten. So the world became bright again and life thrived again

Hilluhengweh was banished to the hinterlands, but no matter how hard they tried Mithra and Horus couldn’t kill him

Horus built a great protective wall in the sky. A wall of ozone that protected life from radiation. A wall we maintain to this day

And so to this day Mithra continues to vigorously maintain his institutions with each new generation, he shall never lose another election

So on this day in the year 12 billion and 151 million the Medieval Age of Terra began.

Some call this era the Boring Billion, but it was a time of great advancement and hardly boring at all.

To this day we go on pilgrimages to Sudbury Ontario to celebrate the deeds of Horus


The protective Ozone layer Horus made for us
It was in this time that the great Supercontinent Columbia formed


Horus bore a son named Thoth, and his sister Mahatma Maat bore two daughters named Seshat and Sophia

Horus carefully methylated his son so he would learn the virtuous ways, but Mahatma Maat was careless, she only methylated Seshat well and not Sophia

Seshat married Thoth Nectarius son of Horus the double-horned

In her arrogance Sophia refused to find a husband. She believed she was beyond all criticism and bore a son on her own

Incubus was her son and he was a great demiurge


Incubus ancestor of the Euglena
Incubus built great nightmarish visions and worlds for all to see, but he thought they were beautiful

He had no guidance and no father, his traditions were corrupted and his methylation pointless.


Sons of Incubus causing African sleeping sickness
When Horus died Thoth and Incubus fought over his mantle.

When Thoth slept Incubus tried to steal his mantle


Incubus the Demiurge
Thoth was paralyzed but by force of will he clutched his father’s mantle so hard Incubus couldn’t steal it

And to this day the sons of Incubus and Succubus enter our nightmares and give us sleeping sickness and Chagas disease and Elephantitis. But they can never steal the mantle of our father Horus

Protist family tree

The marriage of Thoth and Seshat was a great one

Each gave their full genomes. And so their children were Tetraploid


Chromosome 3 breaks in two at the centromere with neocentromeres forming, making the couple a unique species

It is always hard to live with polyploid chromosomes. How can the centrioles figure out which scroll goes where when there are four identical ones not two?

So Thoth and Seshat found a solution

Chromosome 1 remained as is

Chromosome 1.5 split at the centromere

With no centromeres on either half the chromosomes received new ones.

Their enzymes created neocentromeres with new histones in the centers of the new scrolls 4 and 5

Telomerase created new Telomeres for the new scrolls

Chromosomes 2 and 3 remained intact

But chromosomes 2.5 and 3.5 accidentally crossed over


The mutations of scrolls 2.5 and 3.5
First a piece of 2.5 got lost and inserted in 3.5

Then the ends of them swapped between each other

And so 2.5 became 6 and 3.5 became 7

And so they went from Tetraploid to Diploid again and genetic stability was reobtained

With more chromosomes their house had more redundancy. Many inscriptions could change in one location but not another, and so new abilities could be gained without losing others

Thoth and Seshat begat Jimmu and Percolos and Jingu

Like his brethren Percolos was a shapeshifter. He changed from Amoeba to flagellate as he pleased and even to cyst when he need remain dormant


Percolos
Percolos never specialized and his children are few and far between

And so the sons of Percolos invade our brains in envy, they are the brain eating amoebae


Jimmu begat Nectarius and Luka

Luka begat Jakob and Tsukuba

Neither Jakob nor Tsukuba were intelligent or talented


To this day billions of years later their descendants are remembered for not being descended from Nectarius

Nectarius was a great one

Nectarius married Ambrosia daughter of Jingu and they bore twin boys Animus and Plantus and twin girls Opima and Cortica

Opima was a huntress and Cortica was a gatheress

Cortica and Plantus begat Plastidus and Hacroses and Cryptina

Plastidus married Chlora the Cyanobacteria, and so Chlora became the chloroplast like Eve became the Mitochondria


Plastidus and Chlora begat Glauca and Alges and Alga

Glauca took greatly after her mother.

Her chloroplasts bore dresses of Peptidoglycan Sequins, while neither Alges nor Alga had such dresses


Glauca adopted the traditions of her mother rather than those of her mother.

Glauca was a simple woman who had many daughters by herself. They spread across the world and grew great in numbers, for her daughters needed no husbands they had new daughters constantly. The daughters of Glauca are known for their strict traditions, but their numbers have declined in recent times.

In the age of the Proterozoic they were numerous for they cloned themselves without limitations

But they are rare today, for without sex they remained primitive

All the daughters of Glauca are clones today


A few daughters of Glauca
Alga stripped her chloroplast of her Peptidoglycan dress. She built a beautiful sophisticated network of solar panels in her chloroplast


Algas chloroplast
Alges and Alga married and begat Rhodes and Vert

Rhodes was the Patriarch of Red Algae and Vert the Matriarch of Green Algae

Each of them could use their plastids in many ways


Types of Plastids
Dormant Etioplasts that would become Chloroplasts with sunlight

That’s why potatoes turn green in the sun

By the power of Nightshade and Sunshine potatoes grow green and toxic


A green poisonous potato
Colorful Chromoplasts blessed by Lord Carotenus himself

They keep their Carotenoids between their membranes

And show themselves ripe for picking










Chromoplasts and Carotenoids in action
And there were the Leucoplasts. Granaries that store food for hard times

Amyloplasts store starchy grain for hard times. We farm grain ourselves to eat from the stores of Amyloplasts


Amyloplasts in action
Elaioplasts that store oily lard for hard times


Olive oil comes from Elaioplasts
And proteinoplasts that store protein for hard times


Proteinoplasts give nuts protein
The sons of Rhodes were very numerous and quickly spread across the entire world. Their pigments were superior so they absorbed more light than the daughters of Vert


Accessory Pigments of Rhodes
While Plastidus was the ancestor of Plants, Hacroses was the ancestor of a great many others

Hacroses begat Haroses and Haptistus

Haroses bore three sons: Heterokon and Alveolus and Rhizar


The many members of the house of Haroses
Heterokon bore three sons: Ochros and Oomy and Bigyres

Bigyra
Oomy
Ochros found a daughter of Rhodes named Rosa, he stole her and married her


The endosymbiosis of Rosie
Ochros kept her in his house and she became the chloroplast of his lineage

Ochros bore countless children who are much of algae today, Diana the Beautiful, Kelpus the Giant, and Synura the fragrant, and Chrysanthema

Daughters of Diana
Daughters of Synura
Daughters of Chrysanthema
Sons of Kelpus


Kelpus built great cities with millions of farmers. They became the great Kelp forests of the seas.

Diana married Silicon and so her daughters built great shells of silicon for themselves. Nobody mastered silicon as well as her until Silicon Valley

The Diatoms create great fertile sands, Diatomaceous Earth


Bodélé Depression
When the great ancient lake of chad dried up the Diatoms formed great fertile sand. Every year Azoth carries the sand across the Atlantic to the Amazon Rainforest


Many were jealous of the successes of Ochros

Among them Alveolus the younger, son of Alveolus the Elder, cousin of Ochros

Alveolus the younger stole Okra daughter of Ochros, and so his line gained the power of the sun as well

But many were not so lucky

Rhizar, Oomy brother of Ochros, Haptos son of Haptistus, and Cryptos son of Cryptista formed a pact

They formed the Solar Coalition, to take the power of the son for them all

Cryptos was quickly successful, with a jetpack of his own blood he fled the union


Cryptos, his ejectosome is his jetpack
The Solar union, sometimes called the sun animalcules had a mission, to take the power of the sun for the people

And so they took on the form of the sun to pursue their goals.


Heliozoan coat of arms representing the three lineages clockwise from top Oomy/Actinophryids Haptista/Centrohelids and Granofilosea
Alas the mission was long. Haptos bore two sons: Haptos Jr, and Helios

Haptos was the eldest of the union, he did not live to see the successes of his sons

Haptos Jr was successful in stealing a daughter of Ochros and his line became the Haptophytes

Haptos built for himself a great suit of armor



Helios son of Haptos became the ancestor of the Centrohelids, to this day they have had no success

Helios was a vicious predator with his spikes he consumed all he touched.


Helios
Oomy grew a great assortment of spines, Solar tendrils. Of the house Helios.

Oomy bore two sons: Actinophrys was the son of Oomy who never bettered himself

Oomygus build his spines into a great mining network, he became the ancestor of the water moulds




Oomygus Life Cycle
Among the sons of Bigyra there was Minos the Labyrinthmaker


Minos built a great rail network form slime, he moved around on them and ate all the nutrients he found


He built a great civilization and bore many sons who formed the house of the Labyrinth

Rhizar was like a snail. An amoeba with a shell and blood red spikes

He bore many sons and most of them abandoned the Solar order

Rhizar
Vampyrus
Alveolus and and Okra begat Cilliofer and Myzo


Cilliofer became the ancestor of the Cilliophores. Trumpet Slipper Bell and Swan Animalcules Belle bore two daughters: Vorticella who held giant parties, and Ophrydia who cloned herself so much she ceases to be an animalcule



Stentors







They formed a new form of meiosis called Conjugation



Myzo was a vampire that drank the cytoplasm of other cells

Myzo begat Dinoflagellus and Malarius

Dinoflagellus was the ancestor of the Dinoflagellates, swimming algae who feed coral


The sons of Dinoflagellus bear great armored plates


They grew great and prosperous and so they made the water glow


But they turned to carnivory and even cannibalism

And so the water turned red with blood


Malarius was the ancestor of the Apicomplexans. Parasites who gave up on photosynthesis and give us diseases like Malaria


We use medicines targeting their non functioning chloroplasts to stop them


Among the sons of Incubus there was Eugenius

Eugenius married Pyramimonas of the house of Vert and left the evil ways of his fathers. He became the ancestor of the Euglenas, swimming algae between plants and animals, yet all the same more distant from either one than each is from each other



Eugenius the Euglena
Euglenia stored her wealth not as starch but as Paramylon, for she was an alien to the plants and animals


Paramylon
Animus and Opima became the ancestors of the Unikonts

A great clan who we all descend from

They begat Ozymandias and Malawi.

Ozymandias begat Podius and Metamon

Metamon hated women so he never married

Metamon bore sons with no mother and so he has no Mitochondria and his sons only live away from oxygen. They live in the stomachs of cows and give us beaver fever


Podius begat Menes and Ancyromon

Menes begat Amorpheus and Malandas

Malandas begat Mantamonas and Variscus

Amorpheus was our ancestor. The great all-knowing all-living one

In the year 13 billion the world was covered by the great supercontinent Rodinia


The world at 13 billion
The daughters of Rhodes became numerous and prosperous










And when everything looked peaceful and prosperous Hilluhengweh struck
