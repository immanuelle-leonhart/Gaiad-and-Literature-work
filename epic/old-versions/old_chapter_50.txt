Twas the time the lands were being colonized

The daughters of Planta and Anima and Funga all together spread across the lands

Twas a time of peace and prosperity for all

Matsya
Shesha
Shesha the Actinite and Matsya the Tetrite each saw a vision of horror

All-knowing Mithra showed them a fiery doom waiting in the future. They were the two messengers, chosen to save our family

Shesha preached to the creatures of the sea and Matsya to the creatures of the land

They spread the word everywhere they could go.

From Euramerica to Siberia to Gondwana Matsya traveled to all continents warning of the apocalypse

Through forests full of insects and trees he journeyed far and wide. And the people followed his words

Shesha traveled to all the seas

Across the giant reefs, across the great sponge reefsCategory:Pre-Outage Pages

There is an apocalypse coming. The evil one will strike, as he did before in the Silurian. Darkness will descend upon the earth and only the faithful will survive

The people ignored the prophets and mocked them in the seas, yet they took the word of the prophets on the land. And then it happened

So came two demons Kellwasser, and Hangenberg

The reefs of the world were destroyed. The Ammonites who lived in them were left alone to wander the world. For 100 million years reefs would be in ruins

Matsya cried out “Why must history keep repeating? Why must each generation live under this threat again and again? Why must we be lost across the generations and prey to Hilluhengweh?”

All the fishes of the seas in their great armor were destroyed. Only the agile sons of Janus survived.

The sons of Arachnus suffered the most. Two great civilizations: the sons of Trilobos and Eurypter gone in an instant. The sons of Trilobos with only a single survivor named Proeth, and the sons of Eurypter exiled from the seas, never to return.

The blood of ammonites turned the seas red.

The last graptolite lived a lonely life. With nobody else he lived into old age.

Even the lands and rivers were not spared. Soon every river was a river of blood.

Matsya pleaded to Mithra: “Why must this keep happening” and he replied “As long as each generation ignores the struggles of the last, this will be our fate”
