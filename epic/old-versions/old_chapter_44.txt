The sons of Plantus were reinvigorated in their quest to conquer land when the great sorceress Polycomb entered the world

For eleven generations her line alternated climbing to Polysporos. She lived in her mother’s womb like her brothers and sisters but she yearned to live like her mother, strong and independent.

Daughter of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon daughter of two great rulers yet forced to live her life only to have children for she was sporophyte and they were gametophytes

Polycomb read in her mother’s library to learn why she was given such a meager existence.

Polycomb read the countless sagas of her mothers and fathers

She read of the scrolls of Mardoll and Shiva, and saw that the order of gametophyte and sporophyte was far from eternal as her mother said

She saw a scroll labelled PRC2 and she read it with intrigue

Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 she saw the scriptures her mother used to repress her

And so Polycomb burned the scriptures PRC2 would be no more, and took all her mothers lands and cities for herself

And so she broke the barrier. She grew spores and calyptra and stoma like her sisters sporophytes, and rhizoids like her

And so through her rhizoids water rose from the earth and through her stoma left into the heavens

This was how her life transpired ad she rose to heaven

She prayed to Lord Tryptophanes lord of life lord of the sun so she could grow to great heights

And so Lord Tryptophanes blest her with Auxin and she grew to the sun, when the sun struck auxin decayed, and in shade it grew in numbers, and so her stems grew towards the light


Auxin

A daughter of Polycomb growing to the light by the guidance of Auxin
Polycomb bore a daughter named Knoxy

Knoxy married Xylon and together they took after Polycomb

Knoxy searched the scriptures and found a scroll named KNOX2

KNOTTED-like TALE homeobox gene class II the gene that kept her from stoma like her mother

And so Knoxy and Xylon built a great kingdom stretching to the heavens like that of Polycomb

But the kingdom’s roads were clogged, water struggled to reach the heavens, and so Xylon designated a clan of subjects as Xylem, Tracheids, carriers of water from Root to Leaf

Xylon and Knoxy bore a son they named Pholon


Pholon
Pholon saw that his roots were starving, and his Mycorrhizae unionized and demanded ten times the sucrose for their labor

So Pholon built channels in his city like Xylem but carrying food not water

He called these channels Phloem

In the leaves sugar was pumped into the phloem

And the concentration gradient sucked water from the xylem to the sugar in the water, and pressure pumped away from the source

In the roots sugar was pumped out of the phloem, and with that the water pumped out into the xylem again


And by this the roots earned their fair share, and the faithful sons of Glomeros too

And so by the wood wide web Pholon’s empire expanded

Through his faithful Mycorrhizae he provided for his sons

Pholon became known as cookson for he provided food to all and brought great prosperity to the lands

His sons lived underground living off the wood-wide web rather than photosynthesis, they grew lazy in prosperity. And this is how the roles of sporophyte and gametophyte swapped


Cookson bore a grandson named Tracheus, and by Tracheus the tracheophytes were born


Tracheus built leaves, microphylls with a vein into them to act as solar panels in his green energy plan. He built his city greater than even Pholon


He designated a clan in his city as Collenchyma, thick flexible support structures to keep his city together

And the clan of Sclerenchyma: hard and full of lignin the sclerenchyma became wood


Tracheus’ city structure
Soon the sons of Tracheus would come to rule the lands. The Devonian was beginning.
