Among the many sons of Euka there arose many kingdoms

Among these kingdoms three were the greatest: the Kingdom of Plantus, the kingdom of Mygus, and the Kingdom of Metazo. The three great houses that ruled them were proud of the glory they achieved. Alongside the lesser kingdoms of Mygaster, Kelpus, Rhizar, Cilliofer, Oomy, and Myzo

The sons of Mygus
The sons of Mygaster
The sons of Kelpus
The sons of Foramer
The sons of Cilliofer
The sons of Oomy
The daughters of Myxo
The scions of these houses built their own cities. Forming entire kingdoms with their cities.

The sons of Metazo and Anima came to be known as animals

The sons of Mygus and Funga came to be known as fungiCategory:Pre-Outage Pages

The sons of Plantus and Virita came to be known as plants


The original Animal Kingdom
Metazo and Anima founded the Animal kingdom. They built a small city on a rock

Among their citizens were the Choanocytes, the great endodermal men, The Archaeocytes, the great mesodermal women, and the Pinacocytes, the great ectodermal people


Early Animals
Metazo and Anima begat Therion

Therion begat Porifer and Thallus and Cloudi

Thallus became the ancestor of the great geometric ones

Those who attached themselves with holdfasts and had Choanoderms extending in every which way


Cloudi extended his ectoderm up with him

Cloudina daughter of Cloudi took the path of growing with the sediment while Namacalathus son of Cloudi elevated himself higher than the ground


Sons of Cloudi
The mysterious cities of Namacalathus son of Cloudi we will never know their secrets


sons of Namacalathus
Porifer was the first sponge. He made his ectoderm his protector with patches of sheltered choanocytes.

Porifer begat Wallas

Wallas lived his life like his father, but he soon saw danger ahead

A storm was approaching.

And so Wallas ordered his shieldmaidens to pull on their pseudopods as much as they could around the pores.


Smooth muscle cells, like the shieldmaidens of old
These shieldmaidens became the first muscles. These pores would later become our mouths and anuses


Modern muscle forms and organizations
Wallas begat Solenos


Solenos
Solenos sent his holes through his city and they sent water through, so he collected more fish and how city prospered

Solenos begat Leucon and Sponga

Leucon and Sponga begat Vitrius and Spongius


Leucon
Leucon son of Solenos went a step further, he was a Leuconoid sponge. He filled his entire city with a labyrinth of gates and fishermen. His city grew massive. The sons of Leucon built cities of countless forms


Many sponge plans
The eldest son of Leucon was named Vitrius. Vitrius threw a stone at Leucon and killed him, before claiming the throne for himself. He built a great glass house as a symbol of his power, and forced the peasants to work themselves to death for him, he even merged them into a hive mind. When his younger brother Spongius asked him why he killed his father he had one response “Leucon was a tyrant, he worked the people to death to create his canals”, then he ran into his house of glass and said to Spongius “I am invincible and just, for the will of God is on my side and the people love me”. Spongius threw a stone at Vitrius, it broke through his glass house and killed him instantly, then calmly over the corpse of Vitrius Spongius said “people in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones”. To this day we continue to quote Spongius whenever someone demonstrates hubris like Vitrius.

The sons of Vitrius became the glass sponges, forming isolated communities on the fringes of the known world.



Sons of Vitrius today
Spongius ruled justly and kindly to the people. His two legitimate sons: Aristos and Demos would create their own cities.

Demos ruled efficiently yet conservatively. Most sponges of the world are descended from Demos.


Among them were the great green sons of Spongillus who farm everywhere. They even farm in Siberia, the great lake Baikal that freezes over every year under the sign of Scorpio


Sons of Spongillus in Siberia
Alongside them are the great hunter sponges, the sons of Chondrocles





Carnivorous Sponges
Aristos bore two sons: Anu and Calcidoros


Forms of the sons of Aristos
a: Leuconoid, b Sylleibid, c Syconoid, d Asconoid
Calcidoros built the simplest most optimal forms with the blessings of his namesake Calcifer over Silico. He built in all forms across the growing reefs in the tropics





Anu was the most unique. He built with basement membranes, and so he’s unique among all the sponges
