While the sons of Tunicus filtered the seas Vertebratus built for himself a great spinal cord with segments of bone and yellow teeth of keratin


Vertebratus begat Rene

Rene built a great unified system of Nephridia and Generative parts, no longer were they segmented on his sides, now they lived in the core of his being and were centralized together

Rene begat Hemos with his new generative partsCategory:Old Gaiad

Hemos built a great brain bigger than all others, he built blood vessels as an offering to Hausa

Hausa blessed him by transforming a line of his servants into red carriers of Oxygen

And so his brain was always fed and nourished



Hemos begat Haikus the little fish that couldCategory:Pre-Outage Pages

He thought he couldnâ€™t fly but then he said

I think I can

I think I can

I think I can

And then he flew


Haikus
Haikus became the most accomplished in his line

Haikus begat Lampris and Denton

Denton built great white teeth with enamel

And so Denton is the Eloh of Dentistry and Teeth


To this day we honor Denton through our daily mouth-rite


Magical Powders on a bundle of hoghairs
This rite involves a practice which strikes the stranger as revolting. The ritual consists of inserting a small bundle of hog hairs into the mouth, along with certain magical powders, and then moving the bundle in a highly formalized series of gestures.

Once or twice a year we seek out the holy-mouth-man. These priests have an impressive set of paraphernalia, consisting of a variety of augers, awls, probes, and prods. The use of these items in the exorcism of the evils of the mouth involves almost unbelievable ritual torture of the client. The holy-mouth-man opens the our mouths and, using the above mentioned tools, enlarges any holes which decay may have created in the teeth. He puts magical materials are put into these holes. If there are no naturally occurring holes in the teeth, large sections of one or more teeth are gouged out so that the supernatural substance can be applied. The purpose of these ministrations is clear, to arrest decay and to draw friends. We must continue these traditions as long as Denton smiles upon us

By the will of Denton all his sons must be free to see the holy-mouth-men and never denied this by poverty. The great hero Notgnihsaw demands as much

Conodontus begat Conodon the biter and Pterapsis the flier


Conodon
Conodon was a great bearer of teeth, he swam around with great speed


Pterapsis
Pterapsis built for himself a great suit of armor

Among the sons of Cambrius the sons of Haikus would become the greatest, but this was not to happen immediately

Ghosts struck Terra and wrecked it to its core and so the sons of Conodon disappeared, their teeth marked the end of an era

And so came the end of the Cambrian and the Ordovician began and the sons of Conodon rose again to mark this new era with new teeth for the new era
