While the Trilobites ruled the seas, the rivers were free to their lesser brethren

The sons of Arachnus ruled the seas and the sons of Insectus ruled the rivers

The sons of Cain and Abel ruled the lands

And so Crustaceus saw nowhere to go, yet he tried nonetheless to establish his dynasty

Heaven rewards the determination of Crustaceus to rise above all circumstance

Crustaceus begat Karkon and Mushi

Mushi begat two sons: Copepus and LepipusCategory:Pre-Outage Pages


Copepus became the ancestor of the copepods, the little ones of the seas. Insects of all forms.

Sons of Lepipus in the modern day
Lepipus the strange
Meanwhile Lepipus begat Brachios and Silvio


A daughter of Silvio
Some day millions of years later the sons of Silvio would become the great insects that ruled the world

Branchios became the ancestor of the Sea Monkeys and the Water Fleas

Karkon fled to the open waters where he begat Pancer and Cephalocaridus

Pancer begat Oligostracus and Polycruster

Oligostracus bore many sons, among his sons were the seed shrimp and the degenerate tongue worms who live as parasites instead of getting jobs.

Polycruster begat Barnacus and Malacus

Barnacus was a great frontiersman. Barnacus settled down with a stalk on the ground. He lived like a son of Cnider.

Pollicipes cornucopia
Barnacus bore a son he named Goose. Goose was a great and built a great society, but alas no matter how hard he tried he never became a goose


Goose still claimed his sons were the Geese. And so he is the Eloh of the Geese and their sacred guide


Barnacle geese hang from tree, (Miniature) Barnacle geese, as described by Gerald of Wales. They develop from beams in the water and hang from trees enclosed in shells until they can grow feathers and fly. Image taken from Bestiary. Originally published in England (Salisbury?); 1230-1240.
Among the sons of Goose many grew smaller and more compact. They became the Barnacles we know today, half shrimp half coral full animals


Malacus bore many descendants. Among them the crabs and the shrimp and the isopods and the amphipods. They would become a great dynasty among no peers in the future. So great when we speak of the sons of Crustaceus we speak first and foremost of the great sons of Malacus whose dynasty was yet to reach greatness under the yoke of the Trilobites
