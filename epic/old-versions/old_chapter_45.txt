Devon’s city was the greatest among the cities of the era, and so the new era was called the Devonian

As he sat on the ground he sucked water into his first gill, notched between jaws and skull

Through his spiracle his mouth filled with water, and the rich oxygen built for millenia by daughters of Saya


Through his gills the hematic maidens carried oxygen to all his subjects

And to the brain they went through the spiracle, bringing more to his eyes and brain

In opposition and countercurrent, the blood took all the oxygen

When Devon moved he opened his mouth and the water passed freely over and through

When he found food he cleaved it by his jawbone

And behind his teeth followed and chewed
Category:Old Gaiad
Down in the stomach acid purified

Pancreas and gallbladder mixed in

And intestine spiralling innumerably

Nutrition entered his veins

His portal vein

Fats and Sugars, Proteins and Phosphorus, Metals and Vitamins

And his liver purified his blood

The kidneys emptied in

And out the cloaca


Devon’s Spiral valve, lost in Teleosts
When he married his wife he released his sperm

Out the cloaca and to her eggs

Two of the million were Llŷr and Stennisio


Stennisio
The sons of Stennisio lived across the seafloor eating clams

Llŷr begat Bran

Bran begat Caradoc

Daughters of Acantho
Cynan begat Cadwr

Morfawr begat Tudwal

Tudwal begat Cynfawr and Rhineheart

Rhineheart lived on the Rhine, flattened and invisible, like a ray before rays


sons of Rhineheart
Cynfawr begat Custennin and Antiarchon

Antiarchon rebelled against his ancestors for he stood against Archons, an Anarchist

He lived under the soils and waited for prey

The sons of Antiarchon would form great bands of guerillas haunting the sons of Animus

Antiarchon
Custennin embarked on a great journey to find a homeland

He searched far and wide and settled in China

Custennin begat Uther and Petallon

Petallon
Uther begat Arthur and Maxil

Arthur bore a son and daughter: Arthur the Younger, and Ptycho the maiden

The daughters of Ptycho were numerous, among them Mary the Mother of Icthys who bore a placenta millions of years before anyone else


Mary mother of Icthys
The sons of Arthur the younger became known as the Arthrodires

Arthur the Younger bore three sons: Mordred, Wuttago, and Actino

Wuttago
Actino
Mordred turned on his father and bore two sons: Philip and Melehan


Philip

And the sons of Brachy ruled the world, overthrowing the sons of Silur from times past

Brachy begat Eubar and Buchan and Homosteus

Buchan
Homosteus
Eubar begat Pachos and Coccos

Pachos begat Dunkella and Aspino

Dunkella grew greatest yet among the sons of Metazo, 6 meters in length, or three Jaekelopterii, less than Cameroceras but with a thousand times his men

The sons and daughters of Pachos grew great and powerful and ruled the entire world in this age


Dunkella a daughter of Arthur
Maxil brother of Arthur begat Qilinyu


Qilinyu
Qilinyu begat Entelognathus whose jaw was complete


Entelognathus
Entelognathus begat Janusicthus

Janusicthus brought his teeth from gills to jawbone.


And so his jaw crushed down with teeth not bone


Janusicthus
And brought his skull inside

Sensing the nerves of all others

He became the ancestor of the fish and the beasts
