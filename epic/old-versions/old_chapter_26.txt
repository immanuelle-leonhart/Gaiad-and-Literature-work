As the sons of Cambrius multiplied upon the face of the Earth things changed for all the sons of Bios

The sons of Cubos and scyphos multiplied and came to raid their new rulers

Their guerilla campaign lasts to this day as they wait to ambush all they can find


Among the sons of Demos the sponge there was Cyath

Cyath built great cities across the seas, and these cities became known as the reefs. These cities survive to this day passing through countless new rulers


Archaeocyathid sponges that built the first reefs
Among the sons of Demos, came the great hunter sponges, the sons of Chondrocles

Carnivorous Sponges
As the reefs grew and the sons of Cambrius multiplied they took it upon themselves to trap the sons of Cambrius. They hook them in and their shieldmaidens and fishermen come in for the kill.

Among the sons of Spiralius the sons of Brachios flourished. Establishing themselves in the new reefs they became prosperous fishermen


Advancement of the sons of Brachios
And so began the Tommotian Era


Lobopus
Here we continue the chronicle of the sons of Lobopus, as they imposed their vision on all four corners of the Earth

Lobopus saw his will was weak and his citizens undernourished, so he built in his kingdom a heart like Dutrus

Lobopus begat Onychodictyon

Onychodictyon begat Tactopus and Xenu

Tactopus begat Ferreus and Ferox

Xenu declared himself emperor of the galaxy and sought to write into our minds the story of weakness

Xenu begat Gracilis who put an end to his schemes

Onychodictyon gracilis Onychodictyon ferreus and Onychodictyon ferox

And so here the three great houses were born: Velvetclaw Ironfoot and Waterbear

Here we tell the chronicles of Velvetclaw

Gracilis begat Paucipodes and Microdictyon and Xenianus and Therion Velvetclaw

Xenianus bore twin daughters: Xenusia and Diania the Cactus

Microdictyon
Paucipodes
Xena
Diania the cactus
Therion velvetclaw begat Cardios and Hallucigena

Hallucigena begat Sparsa and Fortis and Hongmen and Annika

Hongmen begat Luolishania and Collins monster

Luolishania
Collins Monster
Annika became the ancestor of the velvet worms, shedding her armor for agility

She is a great and caring matriarch to the velvet worms, guiding them to this day


Annika
In the line of Ursus things went differently

Ferox wanted to survive anything. So he downsized and soon became inulnerable. He begat Ursus and Ursus became the ancestor of the water bears

Those who first conquered land. Unable to breathe on land the sons of Ursus go dormant as a Tuns. And so the sons of Ursus were first to conquer land


Ursus

In the line of Ironfoot greatness was yet to come

Ferreus Ironfoot bore two sons: Gille and Hadranax

Gille built for himself a set of gills above his legs and he bore a son named Kerygmachelon who swam with his gills


Kerygmachelon
Kerygmachelon begat Pambdelurion


Pambdelurion
Pambdelurion bore two great sons and a great daughter:

Arthur, Anomalos and the beautiful Opabinia




Arthur built for himself a great suit of armor. He hardened his flying gills and fused them onto his legs

And so his legs could branch for they bore two sides: the gill was the exopod and the leg was the endopod


The sons of Anomalos dominated the seas like none others. They ruled the entire world for millions of years

The horrific conqueror who laid the nations low
On his deathbed it was said

Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.

How art thou fallen from heaven, O Anomalos, son of dawn! how art thou cut down to the ground, which laid low the nations!

For thou hast said in thine heart, I shall ascend into heaven, I shall exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:

I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.

Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.

They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;

That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?

All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.

But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.

Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.

Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.

For I will rise up against them, saith Aegis-Bearing Mithra the lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith Aegis-Bearing Mithra. I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the lord of hosts.

Alas no single manâ€™s death would end suffering

The sons of Anomalos would rule for ten generations as he watched from the realm of Ghedos


The daughters of Opabinia lived humble but beautiful lives


And the sons of Arthur Ironfoot would soon grow greater even than the sons of Anomalos, enduring hardship and persevering with nothing but blood sweat and tears. The sons of Arthur Ironfoot became the Arthropods, today bearing a million species
