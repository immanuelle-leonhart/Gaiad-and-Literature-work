Dikar was a parasite on the sons of Plantus, son in the twentieth generation of Freyr and Hera

With two nuclei the sons of Dikar were powerful and strong


Dikar married Ferma and they begat Ascus and Baston

Both parasites alike on the sons of plantus

Ascus became father of the Cup Fungi and Baston became father of the mushrooms

Sons of Ascus
Sons of Baston
Ascus begat Taphrin and Saccharos

Taphrin as Yeast
Taphrinâ€™s fruiting bodies
Taphrin lived a small simple life as a yeast inside Category:Pre-Outage Pagesplants, he grew long and when he doubled in size he split in half. In adulthood, he built formless fruiting bodies to spread his spores far and wide

His sons are the fission yeast and live in our lungs, they cause us pneumocystis pneumonia when we drop our guard

Saccharos son of Ascus abandoned parasitism, and lived in the soils freely

Saccharos bore two sons Peziz and Melchizedek


A son of Melchizedek
Melchizedek became a small single cell, a yeast

His sons budded off from him in spheres



The blessings of Melchizedek
Melchizedek became the Eloh of bread and beer for he is the greatest among the yeast. He brews our drinks and rises our bread

Peziz bore countless sons: among them Lopez and Orbillus

Orbillus preyed upon the sons of Nematos for food


Orbillus eating a worm
Lopez bore twin sons Ganymede and Leotios

Ganymede became ancestor of the cup fungi

Ganymede
Leotios
Leotios became the father of the filamentous fungi: not simple by any means but keeping their complexity at the microscopic level

Leotios begat Pyrenos and Lecanius

Pyrenos
Lecanius
Lecanius became the ancestor of the Lichens of today, and many more who left the lichen way of life such as Penicillius creator of blue cheese and Penicillin and Capnos father of the Soot Mold

Penicillius
Soot Mold
Baset begat Ortho and Puccini

Puccini became the father of rusts, often reducing to a single cell at times, and also to a giant size. With the largest genomes across fungi and the most complex life cycles

Botry son of Puccini rejected multicellularity altogether and became a yeast


Sons of Puccini
Ortho begat Ustella and Agaricus

Daughters of Ustella
Smuts for sale in Mexico
Ustella blesses our corn harvests with protein and great taste. Her daughters are known as the smuts. Some think they are gross but none who partook in her blessings has ever thought that. Her daughters are loved in Mexico today

Agaricus abandoned a life of parasitism and went to live in the desert

Agaricus bore four sons: Jello, Bartholomew, William, and Gemini

Jello formed a gelatinous vessel for his spores and reentered the rainforests of Virginia


A son of Jello
Jello became the father of Tremello and Dagar

Tremello spent his youth as a yeast, and as an adult he built a great jellyshroom

Dagar became the father of Dacrum and Agaricus

Tremello and Dacrum maintained their gelatinous fruits and became ancestors of the Jelly fungi

A son of Tremello
Sons of Dacrum
While Agaricus created the first mushroom

The sons of Agaricus create many nourishing mushrooms. But alas toads sit on many and corrupt them into toxic Toadstools. Eat mushrooms but not Toadstools for it will save your life
