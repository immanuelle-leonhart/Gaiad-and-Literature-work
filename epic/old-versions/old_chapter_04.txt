Mithra saw there was little in the Amniotic sea to support planets.

Under Mithra’s direction Rokkor built great columns and highways across the Amniotic Sea, and great halos for all to built on. He built islands in the Amniotic Sea.

And so the daughters of Babastella came to live on the islands.

Fifth came Celestella

Sixth came Gigastella

And last came Kali the Eldritch

Some say she was daughter of Babastella

Others say she was daughter of Yin

Elder even to Adonai

So truly we call her

Kali the Eldritch

Kali the Eldritch
The celestial maidens brought their tribes to land.

By Deuter Kali begat many sons: among them were Cepheus and Chiron.

Her sons became the Quasi-Stars, the Quasars, and the Supermassive Black Holes

The sons of Kali were great warriors. Each conquered an empire of their own across the new islands in the Amniotic sea.

Within each of their empires they took all the granddaughters of Babastella as concubines, all stars of the third generation.

All their daughters would be nursed by all their concubines.

Great empires bound together by milk.

So these empires were called Galaxies.

The daughters of the Kalites would be known as mother stars

Stars of the second population

Population II stars

Among these galaxies there was the Milky Way, the Empire of Chiron

Nearby there was the Empire of Cepheus: Andromeda

The Empire of Chiron
As Galaxies emerged there was light again.

The Amniotic Sea became bright, ionized, and stormy again. But this time with Islands and Galaxies and Empires.

In the dance of Galaxies someday the Empires of Chiron and Cepheus will meet. The Galaxy of Milkdromeda will be born.

Within the galaxies Mithra saw potential.

And so Mithra married the stars and the elementals on the galactic steppe.

As stars grew the elementals married them in their rings. This is why in marriages today the groom approaches the bride as she stands in a ring of Stardust.

Ouroboros married many stars, and fathered many daughters

We call the daughters of stars Planetes or Wanderstars for they wander the Cosmos with their mothers.

The daughters of Ouroboros were diamonds in the rough
