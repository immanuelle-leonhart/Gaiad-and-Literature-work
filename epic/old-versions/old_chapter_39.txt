This is the story of the Cephalopods, the great arcane ones who overthrew the great sons of Leviathan

The sons of Cephalopus would grow so much greater than the sons of Scaphopus, to the point few know the sons of Scaphopus at all

Ellesmer
Ellesmer begat Endos and Actinos

Endos bore many sons who moved slowly across the sea. Greatest among them was Cameroceras Magnus, known to history as Cameromagne. Cameromagne overthrew the sons of Leviathan.

Endoceras son of Cameromagne grew nine thousand milimeters long. 20 cubits front to end. He dwarfed Leviathan fourfold.

Actinos by his heavenly air within could ascent up and down from the heavens to the earth

Actinos begat Orthosceros and Tarphy

Tarphy lived fast in his youth, he coiled his shell a hundred times and swam as a great hunter. But in old age he uncoiled his shell and settled on the earth below

In his old age Tarphy bore countless sons and daughters who did the same, living youth in the bounty of the heavens, and age in the safety of the depths

Tarphy begat Oncos and Barrandeos

Oncos lived a coiled but simple life.


Oncos
Oncos bore many sons, eldest was named Rutos

Rutos bore a son named Nautilus and the sons of Nautilus live on today just as they were in the days of Rutos and Cameromagne


Nautilus
Orthosceros begat Ascos and Bacchus

Ascos lived his youth with a clumsy shell unable to swim, and so he broke it off, and in adulthood he was graceful above all others. His sons continued this tradition


Life cycle of the sons of Ascos
Bacchus was small and insinificant but he bore a million sons and daughters, soon the world filled up with his sons and daughters
