Arboreus son of Tracheus was a great settler king

Arboreus split the world between two sons: Lycos and Ginkgon

Lycos released countless spores and by those spores he bore two sons: Isolagos and Lycopodion


Lycopodion became the ancestor of the clubmosses, he built a city so giant it became known as the first tree, a scale tree

Lycopodion
Today his spores are known as Lycopodium powder and used for the power of fire


Isolagos split his spores male and female and raised his sons and daughters in his own city

Isolagos bore two sons: Quill and Sellagine

Quill
SellagineCategory:Old Gaiad
The sons of Sellagine creeped their leaves across the ground, in dry times they died and in wet times they revived


Sellagine reviving
The sons of Quill became known as the Quillworts, they grew their microphylls tall into the sky, with no stomata they absorbed air through the ground, grew their stems underground, their spores underwater


Gingkon branched his leaves two by two, and so his leaves were megaphyllic

And he bore a son named Phyllon

Phyllon
Phyllon begat Pteridos and Gymnos

Pteridos begat Horsa and Euspor

Horsa begat Equis

As a gametophyte the spawn of Equis swam to find their brige

And they found Puzella

And grew roots from there

Equis reduced his veins to one like Lycos and became ancestor of the puzzlegrass

He built armor of silicon to protect his city from all dangers

He spilt ink on his scriptures, and so was lost the megaphylls of times past, his leaves were one vein and one vein only, like Lycos before him

In summer he built puzzlegrass to store nutrients for the winter, and when winter passed he used those nutrients to build horsetails

In spring as the snow melted he built horsetails, with no chlorophyll, only spores and lots of them, his spores spread wide across all nations

In summer he demolished his horsetails, and he built puzzlegrass

And his sons and daughters from the horsetails built puzzlegrass too

And so the sons of Equis and the daughters of Puzella came to rule all across the world

Horsetails
Puzzlegrass
Euspor begat Adderos and Fernando

Adderos begat Ophios and Psilos

Ophios became ancestor of the adders-tongues, he built but one giant leaf

and Psilos of the whisk ferns for he built no leaves at all

Ophios
Psilos
Fernando uncoiled a great frond of leaves


Maratton begat Maratidus and Leptos

Marattidus bore ten thousand spores on each leaf while Leptos bore a mere hundred

Together they became the ancestors of the ferns

As the sons of Arboreus settled the lands they built great swamps across the Mississippi River, and it was here where our ancestors, the sons of Osticthus would climb onto land
