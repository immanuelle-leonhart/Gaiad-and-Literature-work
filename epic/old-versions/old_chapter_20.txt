In the great rivers of Terra there were a great Matriarch and a great Patriarch

Symbio-Mygus son of Mygus, and Charina-Planta daughter of Plantus

Symbio-Mygus was the son in the tenth generation of Zygos the great fungus of the rivers

Charina-Planta was the daughter in the tenth generation of Charina the alga of the rivers

Charina’s cells
Symbio-Mygus and Charina-Planta married and created a great agricultural empire on the shores of the lake of Lichen. A fusion of plant and fungus to conquer the land

When the lake dried they went dormant, and when it rose they rose again

Together they bore many children, the Lichens

With envy Cephaleura daughter of Trentophila is a parasite on the daughters of Amber

Virisca
Greatest of all are the daughters of Amber and the sons of Arbusculus

Amber married Arbusculus and they bore Glomer and Ashley

Ashley married Wort and they became the ancestors of the plants and the mosses.


A city descended from Ashley
Ashley and Wort traded with Glomer. Glomer dug into the ground like his Lichenous brethren for nutrients, while Ashley farmed in the sun.


Mycorrhizae
Ashley and Wort bore innumerable children

They wanted to support their children. So Glomer connected them in a network

That network still exists today, as the Wood Wide Web

An underground economy that supports all plants to this day

The wood wide web wasn’t a bubble. Glomer became the first millionaire from his startup.

Soon countless fun guys joined in. But Glomer is still the biggest WoodNet service provider with 80% market share

Amazon is a crucial part of the Wood Wide Web
By this great union of Symbio-Mygus and Charina-Planta they conquered the lands of the Terra. They built their civilization so great that like the daughters of Saya before them they froze over the Earth

And so began the Cryogenian era
