Paraxus was behexed by Hecate

Hecate was a great Hexenmaiden

She begat a great Hex

A Hex, a Hox, a Homeobox 

And by her Hox Aristos found direction in life

In Pennsylvania the daughters of Hecate have been making Hox signs for centuries, to mark the bilateral symmettry of their buildings and bring order to the cosmos. We continue their tradition in our own homes and temples

With their Homeobox Paraxus and Hecate faced the direction of God

To Aegis-bearing Jehovah, All-Knowing Mithra, All-loving Elohim

Their city was pointed in the sacred direction, best to catch currents.



The sons of Paraxus
And so bilateral symmetry came to be and life found direction

In his youth Paraxus lived as a nomad in the waves, and in age he crawled across the seafloor grazing upon the greens of the seas and the riches of Davy Jones

Paraxus bore three sons: Bilateron and Cnider and Placus


Cnider
Cnider built from each lobe of his body a new mouth from which he fished

Placus kept his simple body to this day



The only placozoan cells
Bilateron continued the tradition of Paraxus, crawling on the ground for greater prey.

To help Bilateron built for himself a pair of observatories manned by a great priesthood of astrologers.

The astrologers came together in pits and looked to the stars for guidance

With the blessing of Lord Carotenus and the incantation [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAX6 PAX6] they built eyes for themselves

Bilateron married Vendia and together they bore Coelomus and Xenus

The sons of Xenus held fast to his traditions. To this day they keep their traditions

Sons of Xenus
Among the sons of Xenus there was Roscoff the great. The farmer who married Tetraselma the alga. Together they became Patriarch and Matriarch of the Roscoff worms.

Millions of Roscoff worms
Coelomus sent his stomach so deep it went through his body and out, so it became his anus

Mesoglea to mesoderm with membranes and cavities there was much room to build

In his coelom he built his kidneys, his nephridia, and from his ectoderm he brought in a great telegraph network connecting every citizen together

Nephrus innervating his city

Coelomus married Kimberella and together they bore Nephrus


Nephrus built for himself small kidneys across his body

Nephrus married Ikaria and together they bore Cambrius


Cambrius segmented his body into countless repeating units, each with sophisticated scaffolding, and a heart pumping between his segments

He unified his million nerves of the cord together. What would this great temple of knowledge be called? Today we call it the brain and Cambrius Eloh of Brains

When Cambrius needed food he took all information from ventral and dorsal nerve cords

He saw prey or smelled prey

And each segment pulsated as he moved forward

When he swallowed it went down his intestine

in each segment nutrition flowed from endoderm to mesoderm and into coelom

And so the hemolymph was filled with harvest

Pumped from each segment to the next by the heart

As his subjects needed oxygen it came in through the skin

As the harvest was eaten so Cambrius filled with Ammonia

So out his Nephridia the ammonia flowed, out each side on every segment

Cambrius married Spriggina

And each sent their genes out through their nephridia

The sperm of Cambrius left the same path the ammonia left, and it met the eggs of Spriggina

And so they became allfather and allmother
