While the sons of Proteus divided quickly the sons of Dutrus were slow

The twin sons born to Dutrus were Saccorhytus the lame and Dietrich the Patriarch

Saccorhytus the lame never grew up. He stayed as larvae forever


Saccorhytus
The sons of Saccorhytus were sparse and weak

In his youth Dietrich the patriarch looked much like his frail brother

Dietrich young
But as he grew he matured.

He built for himself gill slits to filter the ground

A great tail extending past his anus so he could swim well

A heart to nourish all his subjects

And two great nerve cords dorsal and ventral


Until he grew great and big.


Anatomy of Dutrus
The sons of Dietrich spread across the world and grew great

They had great fortune so this time was called the time of Fortune. The Fortunian

Firstborn were twins Ambulus and Chordatus

Ambulus and Chordatus
With the sons of Proteus they vassalized the sons of Ediacar

Ambulus settled on a rock, while Chordatus centralized his ecclesiarchy, so one spinal cord on his back.


Chordatus needed more support, so he built a notochord. And so was born the spinal cord. Chordatus became the patriarch of all chordates and all vertebrates.

The sons of Ambulus followed local leaders and shamans, for they needed no great lords above them.

The sons of Ambulus would become the acorn worms and the echinoderms


The sons of Dutrus saw the end of the Ediacaran Empire. And so truly began the Cambrian era.

Among the sons of Nephrus the sons of Dutrus were late bloomers. They took long to perfect their arts but once there they were unstoppable. From the sons of Chordatus came the Vertebrates and the Sea Squirts, and from the sons of Ambulus came the Echinoderms: The Starfish and the Sea Urchins


In the last days the sons of Nephrus shouted Ediacaro Delendo Est and left behind them great symbols of their power Treptichnal burrows and oxygenized soils.

And so Ediacaro was destroyed. The mats of Saya and the depths of Desulfa were destroyed.
