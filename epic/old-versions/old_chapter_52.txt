Rhipidistius the great was a survivor of the great destruction

Rhipidistius the great bore two sons Dipnos and Tetram

Dipnos became father of the lungfish


Dipnos
Tetram turned his intestine linear, and so he could eat giant fish

All fish have nostrils, and Tetram was no exception, like all fish his nostrils came in four: one on each side for water to enter, and one on each side for water to leave


Koi Nostrils
Tetram breathed not through his nostrils but through his ears

He breathed in with his ears, his otic notches. By this air, he gained the great power of Hausa

But breathing through his ears made him hard of hearing
