The Ordovician began with a great extinction, or did it? The Sages cannot agree. Were these great ghosts menacing beyond belief or mere myth?

After the mists of time cleared again the world was greater. The Planktonic Planimals fed a great new life form.

Leviathan was a great dragon of the sea. Son of the wicked king Magog, Leviathan led his kingdom to peaceful prosperity


The sons of Leviathan grew greater than any before, tenscore myriads of microns long, his body politic was great and full of power. His sons inherited greatness.

The sons of Leviathan ruled the world with great justice. They were shepherds to all the sons of Bios. From the small planktonic planimals to their vicious brothers the Anomalocarids.

Ordovices son of Leviathan was the greatest Emperor of them all, for he built great cities of prosperity that he called reefs.

And so the economy grew like never before. In the great Coral metropolises the sons of Euka gathered far and wide.

Ordovices put the sons of Cnider to work. And so the sons of Anthus built great cities

Ordovices had the daughters of Coraline daughter of Florida daughter of Rhodes build upon the cities too. They built the coralline Algae, the plaster upon the great Corals.

Ordovices saw that the sons of Bryos had no home likewise, and so he blessed them with a home in the great reefs






To this day the great reefs of Ordovices live on as the most prosperous cities of Terra and beyond

And so the economy grew greatly under Ordovices, he became known as the Ordovices the wise, and this boom became known as the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event.

The life of the seas became more prosperous and would only continue to grow greater and more prosperous under the great Ordovician dynasty, twas the first Golden Age
