Esther was the daughter in the tenth generation of Lily the Echidna, the daughter of Dutrus who traded bilateral for pentaradial

Esther saw innumerable planktonic planimals to feed off.

Esther bore two daughters: Crinosa and Blastosa

Blastosa built a city with many brachioles around each ambulacrum.

Blastosa became ancestress of the Blastoids

Crinosa begat Lily Stone and Luther

Lily Stone became the ancestress of the Crinoids

Together the Crinoids and Blastoids spread all across the seas, they became the bulwark of the Ordovician Empire


Luther was dissatisfied with the life of leisure

In his youth he grew a stalk, but he broke free as he came of age

Contrary to his sister he used his arms to walk. His tube feet crawled on the ground

He struggled but he was free

Luther as a young adult
Luther’s underside
To this day the Starfish continue this tradition

Luther bore two sons: Asteros and Echinos

Asteros was traditional and Echinos was innovative

Echinos built his city compact, using only tube feet to move, he never even built a stalk like his father

Asteros
Echinos
Asteros and Echinos went to war each with a million sons in their army

Asteros begat Starfy and Ophis

Echinos begat Orbos and Britta

Ophis and Britta broke the war and married


They begat the Brittle Stars, centralized muscular creatures, machines of great strength and vigor

Serpentus and Baskette son of Ophis and daughter of Britta

Serpentus became the ancestor of the Serpent Stars slithering across the sea floors with great precision. His tube feet were not for moving, only his vigorous muscles served that purpose


A bristle star
Baskette was peculiar, her arms branched a millionfold and she ate all the plankton

She became the ancestress of the basket stars

Starfy begat the starfishes, decentralized cities that may regenerate from anything.

The Starfish are vicious predators ruling their empires with iron fists, that’s why they have five fingers


Starfy the great

Aristotle became the father of the Sea Urchins the great grazers of the seas, Aristotle built a great jaw of five teeth, he called it his lantern for it brought light to his life. To this day we still call it by this name


Aristotle’s lantern
And his great granddaughter was named Sandy, ancestress of the Sand Dollars


Daughters of Sandy
Cucus became the father of the Sea Cucumbers, the great recyclers of the depths who spill their guts at their enemies


And so the Sons of Echidna built their civilization to unspeakable heights, with five sides to every story
