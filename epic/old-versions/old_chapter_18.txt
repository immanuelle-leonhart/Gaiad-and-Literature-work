Anu begat Enki and Homos

Homos kept the lifestyle of his father

Enki became the ancestor of all the creatures who move and scurry in the lands and the seas

Enki set out to the sea in a great galley. He faced with his head forward and sailed. He had many men move his barge with millions of oars to move forward.

Enki found he was lost. So he recruited men to find his way. Astrologers who looked out to the stars for guidance. Flask cells, Flamens.

The great Flamens would look out into the stars, and they saw skies full of sponge larvae with rich yolks and found the most auspicious spots to build cities


The Flamens prayed for guidance

Tyrosine the Devil came and blessed them with three incantations: Adrenaline, Noradrenaline, and Dopamine

Tryptophanes the Sun came and gave opposing incantations: Serotonin for day and Melatonin for night

And for twilight he brought the great incantation of DMT

Glutama the Empress brought the incantations GABA and Glutamate

Enki said to the Elohim “We need more incantations if the will of Aegis-Bearing Jehovah be manifest”

Without an answer Enki looked into the stars for answers


Mithra bestowed upon him the great incantation of Acetylcholine

Iodina the great mother told Enki the great incantation of love

CYIQNCPLG

And so this great incarnation was known as Oxytocin

Kali blessed him with three incarnations to numb the pain

alpha: YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVT

beta: YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVTLFKNAIIKNAYKKGE

gamma: YGGFMTSEKSQTPLVTL

And so the incantations of Kali came to be known as endorphins

The sons of Adam have used these incantations in many forms: Opium Morphine Heroin and Fentanyl.


And all these incantations became neurotransmitters


The incantations of neurotransmitters
Flamens would spear larvae, and soon they coordinated their hunts. They became known as Nematocysts

Nematocysts
Soon they coordinated completely and grew long telegraph cables. They became nerves.

And this is why to this day priests carry spears and wires

Ancient Nerve Cells
Through this they began to build a greater net. Robotic arms around the Osculum that could catch sponge larvae from the seas, so Enki grew great and powerful.

Enki covered his tentacles with Choanocytes. To catch fish, great and small.



Enki’s city
Proto Animal Anatomy
Enki bore two sons: Paraxus and Xiangus



Xiangus had his fishermen in great robotis arms upon arms


Xiangus
Xiangus begat Daihua


Daihua
Daihua begat Dinomischus


Dinomischus
Dinomischus begat Siphus


Siphus
And Siphus became the ancestor of the Ctenophores, the Comb Jellies


And Paraxus would become ancestor of far greater nations
