In the 13 billionth year  Hilluhengweh struck at Terra with a great burst of gamma ray

Before Hilluhengweh struck the seas were red since the sons of Rhodes were everywhere. But after there were only two survivors Lifthasir and Embla. They tried to rebuild their race but alas their children needed to inbreed, they lost much of their traditions and genes and their scrolls degraded beyond repair. Among their children Queen Florida and her consort Florida man build to create a kingdom, the kingdom of Floridea


A daughter of Florida today
The sons of Lifthasir and the daughters of Embla never created a culture like their ancestors. This is why plants are green not red.


The three nations of Algae

Stromatolites before the Holocaust of 13 billion
In that time the Stromatolites nearly vanished. But the ancient ruins of their great cities still survive to this day

And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,

That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.

And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.

There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.

Among these sons of God was Rhizar the great hero who thrived in the post-apocalyptic world

Rhizar son of Haroses bore two sons: Nephillus and Filoses

Filoses bore Chlorar and Thaumatus


Chlorar
Chlorar married a daughter of Virita and became the ancestor of a line of Algae.

Thaumatus bore many sons, who were each amoebae of unique forms, some with shells and some without

Among the sons of Thaumatus was Paul

Paul was not photosynthetic, but for almost a billion years his line envied the line of Chlorar, yet he rejected the Heliozoan path


Long after the others married into the house of Saya a son of Paul named Paulinellus married a different daughter of Saya. This is the second time only that endosymbiosis of Cyanobacteria happened

Nephillus was the ancestor of many great ones

Nephillus begat Vampyrellida and Testatus

Vampyrellida was a fanatical heliozoan


Testatus built for himself a great shell

Testatus bore two sons: Radios and Gromius


Gromius grew huge. So huge the sons of Adam can see the sons of Gromius without microscopes.

The sons of Gromius bear millions of Nuclei.


The garbage dump of Gromius circa 13b-12020
Although the sons of Gromius are great they keep their waste in Garbage dumps within their cells. So is the curse of Gromius that they can’t manage their waste

Radios begat Retar, and Acanthareus

Radios was a great floating sun with a brilliant geometric sun, with his tentacles he caught all the fish, and the sons of Dinoflagellus lived in his shell for protection


Radios
Radios begat Zancleus who joined the clan of Helios and shed his shell, Retar the artist, and Acanthar the metalsmith

Retar the artist built a great shell, he bore two sons: Foramer and Polycyston

Polycyston built a great shell of Opal

Foramer bore many children. Among them Nummulus Esther and Monoth



His chambers were great and his life long



Nummulus became the ancestor of the Nummulites and Eloh of coins


Sons of Nummulus
Monoth son of Foramer had many sons. Whenever he had a new son he added a new room to his house for the son. His kingdom grew massive.

Some of his sons founded their own kingdoms and they became the Xenophylophores


Xenophylophore
Among the Xenophylophores were Spiculus and Oceana


Spiculus and Oceana
They built a unique kingdom in the ruins of sponges. Marine biologists had thought for millennia that they were sponges.

Esther became the ancestress of the Star Sand. She built great beaches in Okinawa, and build the Great Pyramids of Egypt. There were no aliens involved, only a billion-year-old Elah of Kawaii. If you want Esther’s help in building a great tomb for your father you can buy some Star Sand here


The daughters of Esther
Myxo daughter of Delta daughter of Protea saw the sons of Euka growing and wished to rival them. So she founded a Queendom of her own. She was a great woman of old, a woman of renown. A great conqueress.

And Akrasia the brain eating amoeba tried to build her own kingdom. But alas with little effort she was unsuccessful


Akrasia
Among the daughters of Saya many formed their own Queendoms.


We call her Queendoms the Maidenhair of the Ocean

Plantus son of Virita founded an unstable kingdom. When he died his two sons Charos and Chloros fought over his domain.

After a great war Chloros won and pushed Charos up a river.

Charos cursed Chloros so that his sons may never form a great dynasty

Chloros begat Chlorovos and Pyramona who would be stolen by Euglenon

Chlorovos begat Utico and Chlorodendrus and Palmos

Utico begat Ulvophyceus and Trebouxes and Chlorophyceus

Ulvophyceus begat many children. Among them many chose not to create kingdoms, and many did following the example of Metazus.

Valonius son of Ulvophyceus chose not to make a kingdom. Instead he ate his children and did so so much that he grew to a massive size. Occasionally he splits in two and these descendants became the bubble algae.


Sons of Valonius, all individual cells
Acetabuler likewise chose not to found a kingdom. Instead he just grew so large he became a kingdom in himself.

Codius founded a kingdom that he named Codium, but others call it the deadmans fingers.


Codium
Lettus founded the kingdom of sea lettuce

Cladofer the great stringy seaweed bore a daughter named Torasampe. Torasampe married a commoner named Marimo, but Cladofer opposed their union and made them into little balls of love


Marimo balls
Trent who would explore freshwater with Charos


The city of Trent
Caulerpus absorbed his children.

Sons of Caulerpus
Noriko became the ancestress of the Nori. Her daughters would form a covenant with the sons of Adam to create sushi


The covenant of Noriko
Trebouxes bore many children, all tiny

Among them Prasiola who lives on the lands of Westarctica


Prasiola
Many daughters of Trebouxes live with Lichen today

Chlorophyceus claimed the throne and begat two sons: Volvox I, and Nival and Chlorococcus


Volvox I succeeded the throne and tried to establish a kingdom. Seeing the success of Metazus he formed a Virus Corps to suppress dissent. With each generation a few sons escaped but soon his city grew. Each generation was led by another Volvox: Volvox II, Volvox III, and so forth. Volvox XIX had 50,000 subjects, in massive spheres with his sons ruling duchies within the sphere.

Chlorodendrus became the father of Tetraselma who would form a covenant with the Roscoff worms



Roscoff Worms
Palmos formed a gelatinous city


Palmos
Meanwhile Charos flourished in the rivers, founding his kingdom there.

Ophrydius son of Cilliofer built a kingdom of his own, a great kingdom full of algal farms

His sister Sorogena built a great aerial transport network for her daughters


Among the great men of renown there were Amorpheus and Unika, our ancestors


Amorpheus married Unika and together they bore two sons: Obazo and Amoebus

Amoebus was a father of many shapeshifters


Sons of Amoebus
Among the sons of Amoebus there was the great conqueror Mygaster

Mygaster son of Mycetos son of Semicon son of Conos son of Evos son of Tevos son of Amoebus

Mygaster was a brutal commander and a military genius. He led his legions to victory with great intelligence and will. He created an advanced civilization that became the greatest empire the world had ever seen, and his sons continue his legacy to this day. We know the sons of Mygaster as the Slime Molds










The sons of Mygaster and their great civilizations
Us sons of Choanus study the sons of Mygaster to learn the sacred arts of intelligence they created

Obazo begat three sons: Brevitus the Witty, Apus, and Opisthus


Opisthus begat Holozos and Holomys

Holomys was an amoeba with great filamentous pseudopods, like mycelium and hyphae

Holomys begat Cristis and Mygus


Holomys
Cristis built great branching pseudopods. Traditional hyphae

And so he joined Helios and too became a sun animalcule

Fungi developed their pseudopods into complex networks of hyphae. Their entire bodies became their pseudopods within great walls of chitin

Image result for mycelium
The Mycerlium of Mygus
Mygus wanted more, and his desire became a great kingdom, the kingdom of fungi


The sons of Mygus
Mygus swam across the sea seeking a great land of plenty


Life Cycle of Mygus
Mygus swam with his flagella until he found the land of plenty, a rotting carcass of Kelp


1- Hyphal wall 2- Septum 3- Mitochondrion 4- Vacuole 5- Ergosterol crystal 6- Ribosome 7- Nucleus 8- Endoplasmic reticulum 9- Lipid body 10- Plasma membrane 11- Spitzenkörper/growth tip and vesicles 12- Golgi apparatus
He extended his pseudopods so far into the kelp they became his entire mass. They became the mycelium, an advanced logging network like the world never saw before

Mygus released two spores who found their own promised lands: Rozella and Hyphus

Rozella became the mother of Rozellida and Microsporidia lazy parasites who infiltrated the cities of others and live off welfare

Hyphus bore two sons: Chytros and Aphelidus

Aphelidus took after Rozella and became a parasite

Chytros reached a new grade of evolution: his sons swim around the seas and harvest all nutrients they can. His sons are the original marine fungi

Chytros begat Blastos

Blastos begat Amastigos

Amastigos begat Zygos

Zygos was different from his Cytrid brethren, and his cousins: Neocallimas and Blastos Jr

Zygos reached a new grade of evolution: he swam up a river and built an empire upriver

He built three spores: Zygospores, Mitospores, and Chlamydospores


Life cycle of Zygos
He lived in freshwater and distributed his spores with fruiting bodies, broken by harsh winds and currents and collisions, and abandoned flagella forever

Among his sons are the bread molds

A cannibalistic son of Zygos
Bread and other goods given as an offering to Zygos
Among the sons of Holozos there were many great ones

Holozos begat Icthyosper and Filozos


The sons of Icthyosper grew rigid. They rejected the ways of pseudopods and grew great cities with great walls and until they reached maturity, then they burst into hundreds of cells.

Today they live in the cities of fish off welfare programs

Filozos begat Filaster and Choanozos


Filaster was a flagellated amoeba. His pseudopods were great and flexible. With them he caught countless prey and his sons often built small prosperous villages

Choanozos was a great hero. After years of brutal warfare his descendants would consolidate and become the animals


The great wars of Choanozos will be remembered for trillions of years to come
