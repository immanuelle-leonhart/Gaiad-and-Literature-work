Among the sons of Cambrius there were two hydrostatic sons: Chordatus son of Dutrus and Annelidus son of Protos

Each supported themselves with water pressures, by hydrostasis

Together they saw problems, as they moved their blood moved with them, so they needed to move to nourish their organs

So they built hearts for themselves with veins and arteries and everything

Together each built for themselves closed circulatory systems
