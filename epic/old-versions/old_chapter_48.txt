This is the book of the generations of Janus

Janusicthus begat Kondricthus and Osticthus
Category:Old Gaiad
As they lived their waters grew suffocating and toxic

One day they prayed to Elohim for a solution with an offering of 100 trilobites

And Elohim said unto them “I shall grant one of you sight to see the stars, and the other I shall grant a nose to smell all the chemicals of life”

Chondricthus said “I as the eldest son shall take the nose so I shall outhunt the placoderms and conquer the seas”

And so he was granted a nose of a thousand scents

Osticthus received from Elohim a ring of bone around each eye to hold the lens and a new cell: cone cells that could detect colors

And so the sons of Osticthus would come to rule by sight and the sons of Kondricthus by smell


Icthyosaur eye rings
Kondricthus smelled sweeter waters away, while Osticthus saw the clean air of heaven and the sons of Arthropus there

Acanthus son of Kondricthus challenged the reign of the Placoderms

He built a skeleton not of bone but of cartilage, and his wife laid but a few eggs they deeply cared for


Acanthus
Osticthus swam up the Elivagar River, called the Mississippi and New River today


Osticthus breathed air through his spiracles, as he opened his cheeks

And then he pushed it down, down his throat


And so his spiracles came to be for air not water


Osticthus
Us sons of Osticthus come together to sing the hymn of Elivagar and celebrate our unity

Almost heaven, West Virginia

Blue Ridge Mountains, Elivagar River

Life is old there, older than the trees

Older than the mountains, growin’ live a breeze

Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain mama

Take me home, country roads

All my memories gather ’round her

Miner’s lady, stranger to blue water

Dark and dusty, painted on the sky

Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain mama

Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the mornin’ hour, she calls me

The radio reminds me of my home far away

Drivin’ down the road, I get a feelin’

That I should’ve been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain mama

Take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain mama

Take me home, country roads

Take me home, down country roads

Take me home, down country roads

Osticthus married Eutelea and together they bore two sons: Actinus and Sacropter

Sarcopter saw potential in the forests of Elivagar, he swam through the forests, and built strong bony lobed fins to push himself through the trees

While Actinus saw with the air of heaven in his belly he could fly underwater. His lung became a swim bladder and he went onto conquer the Baltic Sea. He built ray fins that helped him fly and married Andrea Lepis who laid 900 eggs


The fins of Sacropter and Actinus
And so the sons of Osticthus: Actinus and Sacropter, and Acanthus son of Chondricthus became the fathers of the three great vertebrate houses
