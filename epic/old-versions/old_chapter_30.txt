While the sons of Cambrius flourished in the seas the sons of Symbio-Mygus and the daughters of Charina-Planta pushed the frontiers

But soon they had competition.

Category:Pre-Outage Pages
Euthy
Euthy daughter of Mandibulus was being pursued by a great enemy: Anomalocaris the great chased her aggressively. Her precious eggs needed protection, so she did what she had to do, she jumped through the shimmering sky and up the rocks extending to the heavens, and so she burst out of the sea and onto the land.


Euthy collapsed on the ground suffocating in the air. But she and her husband protected their eggs until the end

Among the daughters of Euthy there was Myry the trepanated

Myry the pierced was born like her sisters, but she suffocated in the water. So her father pierced a hole above all 10,000 of her legs. Through these holes she was free to receive the blessings of Hausa directly into her body. To this day her descendants still breathed this wayCategory:Old Gaiad


And so the daughters of Myry could breathe air. They became known as the Myriapods

Myry the pierced maiden explored the new lands she found. She discovered she was not alone.

Tis tradition we call the land she discovered Myry’s coast, but she was not the first one there, we now call it the coast of three kingdoms to acknowledge every side of history



The daughters of Myry
Myry saw the great lichen cities borne of the covenant of Symbio-Mygus and Charina-Planta. Sprawling cities half mold and half moss. Mycelium digging down to the riches of the earth and thallus basking in the blessings of the sun. These great cities spread across the land and whenever cities met both the fungal and the plant citizens married each other.

City structure
Myry ate the cities and stole their nutrients

But as she did she was messy, as she ran around she dropped cells everywhere, all across the globe

Reconstruction of Myry’s first raids on the Symbionese Empire
Soon the sons of Mygus and the daughters of Charina built cities all across the land

Myry bore two sons: Cain and Abel

And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Aegis-bearing Mithra. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Aegis-bearing Mithra had respect unto Abel and to his offering: But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. And Aegis-bearing Mithra said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother’s keeper? And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground. And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand; When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. And Cain said unto Aegis-bearing Mithra, My punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. And Aegis-bearing Mithra said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Aegis-bearing Mithra set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. And Cain went out from the presence of Aegis-bearing Mithra, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Centipus: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Centipus.

Cain became the ancestor of the Caintipedes, misspelled as centipedes by the ancient Romans

Abel became the ancestor of the millipedes for his wife was with child, for Cain ripped him into a million pieces

Enraged at the death of Abel Myry lunged at Cain and in their fight both passed on to the realm of Ghedos

In death the sons of Mygus took revenge. Hera daughter of Mygus and Freyr son of Mygus, both in the twentieth generation resided within the corpses of Myry and Cain

As they grew they built great cities, and soon their hyphae met

When they met they married, but they heard a message from Mithra:

O great couple Freyr and Hera your situation is prosperous but it shall be barren for decades to come, postpone consummating your marriage and when you bear children they shall be fruitful and multiply

And so they followed his guidance, and then they married they only married their cells, not their nuclei

And so each cell was shared by each of them, each nucleus was in each cell.


Dikaryotic cells
And so when the two became one they waited decades decomposing the daughters of Myry. They became the ancestors of the high fungi, the great fungi who make mushrooms and penicillin.

Among those sons of Plantus that stayed with the sons of Mygus there were two brothers: Stomatos and Hepatos


Connected to the network at a cellular level they built a great partnership with the sons of Glomulus

Stomatos saw the holes in the sides of the sons of Myry, he pierced holes in himself so he could breathe better

Hepatos refused the foreign magic

And so Hepatos became the ancestor of the Liverworts

And Stomatos ancestor of all other plants


Today we honor Stomatos as the Eloh of transhumanism, of always being better even when you must reassess your beliefs and accept new ideas

As the sons of Stomatos rose Hillu struck back with a venegeance, and so many lineages would be lost forever
