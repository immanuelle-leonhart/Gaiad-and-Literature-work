While the Molluscs were growing strongly we must not forget the foundation of Mithra’s Empire


First Amaterasu blesses us with light. A millionth reaches Terra’s seas

And so the daughters of Bacta farm with her light. First among them the daughters of Saya

The sons of Viros take their share from the daughters of Saya.


And so the viruses were predators and the daughters of Saya were preyCategory:Old Gaiad

By the viruses came a new link


The daughter of Pelagia
The daughters of Pelagia, the benevolent sisters of the mitochondria ate the remnants of the Cyanobacteria. And so they grew such great numbers we cannot conceive them

And then there were ye olde purple farmers who came before the daughters of Saya


Ye Olde Purple Farmers
Roseobella a great daughter of the Elah of lesbian motherhood herself among the great purple farmers continue to live as planimals of the sea

Among these bacteria and viruses and detritus alike all were consumed by the great crown-tails the choanoflagellates, our closest cousins



Alongside the sons of Choanos there were the tiny golden algae


Golden Algae
The sons of Dinoflagellus saw the prosperity of the sons of Chrysalgos and Choanos, and so they ate both and photosynthesized.



Sons of Dinoflagellus
And do they gained more energy and prospered

In their prosperity their numbers grew. The water glowed bright in their phototrophic rituals


But soon they grew degenerate

The sons of Dinoflagellus turned to cannibalism and the water grew red with carnage


The blood poisoned all it touched

And soon the Rotifers swooped in

Consuming the remnants of a great civilization the rotifers grew fat and saved us from the plague

Xanthus the Dinoflagellate saw the carnage and fled, as he fled he saw the great glass houses of the Diatoms

Immune to the conquests of Rotifers and the sons of Viros the Diatoms thrived as farmers


Then he saw the coccolithophores who too grew with armored protections


And so he cried out to lord Mithra

Why must my line be deprived of such protections O Lord?

Shall I be forced to live life in danger forever?

And then he saw in the distance

Acanther son of Radios

A great starry greenhouse open to him



And so he lived within Acanther

And he found prosperity within him




Dinoflagellates farming within Radiolarians
Radiolarians as floating greenhouses with glass shells farming algae

Meanwhile the green algaes grew so big they grew protection in numbers


Sargassos the Lord of Kelp grew a city millions of cells wide for he was the greatest of the phytoplankton


And so the Fungi, the sons of Chytros came to break them down

And so they ate them and releases a million spores

The fungi are the Robinhoods of the sea coexisting with the Oomycetes, kelp who want to be fungi

And so they brought energy to all the little creatures of the sea from the great ones


And from here the great zooplankton emerged

The sons of Foramer and sons of Cilliofer

The sons of Foramer in the soils and waters fished in the seas, of the spores and radiolarians and all others


They built great shells, snails built their shells off the shells of his lineage


The sons of Cilliofer were great and used their cillia to suck food into their mouths


Tiny Trilobites ate the sons of Foramer and Cilliofer


The sons of Chordatus burrowed through the soil, finding all that fell there through their gill slits and pumping it out their atriopores


Anatomy of Chordatus

Chordatus
Chordatus begat Olfacter and Lancelot

Lancelot continued the traditions of his father

Olfacter bore two sons:

Vertebratus and Tunicatus

Vertebratus worked on his spinal cord

Tunicus sat on a rock and filtered the water

He pumped water through his filter so much he made it most of his body

Tunicatus bore two sons: Larvaceus and Ascidaceus

Larvaceus never settled, he built a giant house of mucus and fished with it


Ascidaceus became the ancestor of the sea squirts. He built a wooden Tunic of cellulose around himself and filtered

Ascidaceus bore two sons: Stolidos and Proteus

‘Proteus begat Thallasus and Enterogon

While his brethren lived as sea squirts Thalassus built his city floating in the sea


Thalassus bore a son named Dolios who lived a solitary life fishing on his own



The arrow worms and trilobites fed off the sons of Dolios, as did many a jellyfish

But Thallasus bore more sons: Pyros and Salpus who built giant cities and nurtured their young

Pyros
Salpus
Pyros built a giant tube city propelled by wastewater, while Salpus built a great chain of beings
