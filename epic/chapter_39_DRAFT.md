# Chapter 39: The Coast of Three Kingdoms (DRAFT)

While Cambrius' sons flourished bright and well
In seas where ancient waters flow,
The sons of Symbio-Mygus fell
To frontiers wide they'd come to know.

With daughters fair of Charina-Plant
They pushed the boundaries far and wide,
Across the world's divide they'd grant
New territories on every side.

But soon they faced a pressing test—
Competition claimed their rightful place.
For Euthy, daughter brave and blessed,
Of Mandibulus showed her grace.

Her all she gave to save her young
While being chased among the waves,
By Anomalocaris she was hung
Between the waters and their graves.

Her precious eggs required care
And protection in their time of need.
So she did what she must declare—
In Hausa placed her trusting creed.

She leaped through shimmering skies so high
Up rocky crags that reached above
To heavens bright beyond the sky,
Protecting those whom she would love.

And so she burst from ocean deep
Onto the land so wild and free.
The first to make that mighty leap
From waters dark across the sea.

Upon the ground she fell with grace,
Though suffocating in the air
So thin and strange in that new place,
Throughout the foreign ranges there.

But she and husband true and bold
Protected eggs they knew must live
Until their story could be told—
Their legacy they'd always give.

Among brave Euthy's daughters bright
Who left the waters of their birth
Was Myry pierced, who gained her sight
Upon the substance of the earth.

Like sisters born she came to be,
But water made her spirit mourn—
She suffocated in the sea
Within that liquid realm forlorn.

Her father, seeing her distress,
Pierced holes above her thousand legs
Where breathing never would digress,
Where air its sacred mercy begs.

Through these holes she became free
To take in Hausa's blessing pure
Into her frame directly, she
Could breathe with confidence secure.

Her children to this very day
Still breathe through holes pierced in their sides.
The breath that saved her shows the way
Through earthly air that e'er abides.

And so the daughters heard the call
Of Myry sweet to breathe the air—
The Myriapods, one and all,
Complete in breathing's daily care.

Myry the pierced explored with wonder
The new lands she had come to love.
She found she was not torn asunder—
Others dwelt beneath above.

Tradition names this sacred place
"Myry's coast" to show her fame,
But she was not first in this space—
History tells a truer name.

Now called the "Coast of Kingdoms Three"
To honor every noble side
Of life's great terrestrial spree,
Where three domains learned to abide.

Myry gazed with eyes of wonder
At cities torn not by the rain
Nor storm nor any rolling thunder:
Lichen cities born from strain

Of covenant 'tween species bound—
Symbio-Mygus living well
With Charina-Planta, found
Together in their citied dell.

Sprawling cities wide and vast,
Half mold and moss beside each other,
Their partnership would ever last:
Mycelium, like faithful brother,

Delved deep down to earthly gold
While thallus, brave and bold and bright,
Basked in the sun's warm rays of old
From heaven's ever-blessing light.

These cities spread beneath each star
Across the lands both near and far.
When cities met they'd always marry—
Both fungi and plants would carry

Their ancient vows to live as one,
Their partnership would ne'er be done.
Each nation wedded to the other
Like faithful sister, loving brother.

But Myry was not mild or gentle
In her ways elemental.
She ate the cities, consumed them whole,
And from their substance stole their soul.

But as she wandered all around
She dropped upon the fertile ground
The scattered cells from everywhere
Throughout the breathing, living air.

Across the globe these fragments fell,
Her messy eating served her well—
She left the pieces of her meal
For other hungry mouths to steal.

Soon Mygus' sons began to build
New cities where their hopes were filled
With daughters fair of Charina
Across each earthly arena.

But Myry bore two sons so dear:
When dawn broke Cain would first appear,
And Abel, gentle, mild, and true,
Her peaceful child she always knew.

In process of the passing time
Each brought an offering sublime
To Mithra's judgment, just and true,
Their sacrifice to render due.

Cain brought the fruit of earthly ground
Beneath his feet where it was found.
Abel brought the very best
Of flocks that he had long possessed.

And Mithra showed his great respect
For Abel's gift, his sacrifice blessed,
His offering pure and true and right,
But Cain's he cast from holy sight.

Then Cain grew wrathful, fell his face,
His countenance lost all its grace.
The Lord spoke unto Cain with care:
"Why does thy heart such sorrow bear?

If thou dost well and dost thy best,
Shalt thou not be among the blessed?
But if thou choosest paths of wrong,
Sin's dark desire grows ever strong."

But Cain approached his brother dear
And spoke to Abel, drawing near.
When they were in the field alone
Cain's hatred fully had grown.

Against his brother he arose
And dealt his gentle life death's blows.
With murder's sharp and deadly knife
He stole away sweet Abel's life.

And Mithra called to Cain with dread:
"Where is thy brother? Is he dead?"
"I know not where," Cain did reply,
"Am I his keeper?" came his cry.

"What hast thou done this evil day?
Thy brother's blood to me doth pray
From ground where he was struck and killed—
Thy curse shall surely be fulfilled.

No more shall fertile ground give strength
To thee through all thy days' full length
Upon this earth where you shall roam—
A wanderer without a home."

Then Cain cried out in fear and pain:
"My punishment I can't sustain!
From earth and thee I now am driven,
No place of rest to me is given.

A fugitive I'll always be,
And whosoever looks on me
While wandering shall strike me down—
I cannot escape this frown."

But Mithra marked him with his sign:
"Whoever kills thee, power divine
Shall bring on him sevenfold pain
For daring to destroy my Cain."

And Cain departed in his shame
To Nod's land, a place of blame,
East of Eden's guarded gate
To meet his self-appointed fate.

There Cain knew his wife so dear
And built a city-life sincere.
She bore to him Centipus bright,
A son of wonder and of might.

The city bore his glorious name
Of Centipus, son of fame.
And Cain became the ancestor
Of Caintipedes, predecessor

(Misspelled by Romans of old days
As "centipedes" in their displays)
Who hunt with poison in their bite
Throughout both day and darkest night.

But Abel's wife, so gentle, true,
Was heavy with a child she knew
Would come when Cain's rage tore apart
Her husband's kind and gentle heart.

In million pieces, small and bright,
Abel's body lost its fight.
His wife, with child she carried blessed,
Became the gentle ancestress

Of millipedes so mild and sweet
Who never harm what they might meet,
But eat the leaves that gently fall
And help decompose them all.

Enraged at Abel's cruel death
Myry drew her vengeful breath
And lunged at Cain with all her might—
They fought their final, fatal fight.

Both passed to Ghedos' shadowed realm
Where death eternal holds the helm.
But in their corpses, cold and still,
Lay seeds of life and future will.

In death, the sons of Mygus came
To take revenge for shame and blame.
Hera, daughter true and bright,
And Freyr, strong beyond all sight,

In generation twenty found
Their home within the hallowed ground
Of corpses cold from days of old
Where ancient, sacred stories told.

As they grew within the dead
They built their cities, safely led.
Their hyphae met when growth was done
And two had truly become one.

When they met they chose to wed
But heard what holy Mithra said:
"O couple great and true and blessed,
With you prosperity shall rest.

But barren you must always be
For decades long, wait faithfully.
Postpone your marriage bed so sweet
Until I make your lives complete.

When children you at last shall bear
They'll multiply everywhere,
And fill the earth with life renewed
As husband, wife, together wooed."

They followed his divine command
And wandered through the fertile land,
They married only cells alone,
Not nuclei they called their own.

Each cell was shared between the two,
Each nucleus lived wholly through
In every cell that they had made—
Their sacrifice was well repaid.

Dikaryotic cells still tell
Their story, lived and loved so well,
Of patience, love, and sacrifice
Blessed beyond all earthly price.

Long decades they waited there
Decomposing with such care
The daughters of brave Myry's line—
Their ministry was most divine.

They became the ancestors
Of higher fungi, processors
Of death into the gift of life:
Sweet mushrooms healing earthly strife

And penicillin's wondrous power
To heal in any darkest hour.
The mighty fungi arose bright
From where their love chose to unite

And wait for Mithra's sacred word,
Their patient love at last was heard
Through waiting in the earthly ground
Where deepest wisdom can be found.

Among great Plantus' noble sons
Who stayed when earthly day begun
With Mygus' sons were dwelling near
Two brothers, honored, loved, and dear:

Stomatos and Hepatos wise,
Who chose their separate ways to rise.
Connected to the network blessed
Of cells that never cease their quest

At levels cellular and small
They built partnership for all
With sons of Glomulus so bright
And glorious beyond all sight.

Stomatos saw the holes so small
In Myry's sides through which air would fall.
He pierced himself to breathe as well
And learn to breathe and to excel.

But Hepatos would not be swayed
By foreign magic newly made.
He kept his ancient, faithful ways
And walked his path through all his days.

Hepatos became the sire
Of Liverworts' eternal choir
Who keep the ancient ways alive
Until this day they ever thrive.

But Stomatos became renowned
As ancestor whose name is found
In every other plant that grows
And in their living dance bestows

Their beauty on the world each day.
We honor him in every way
As Eloh bright, the shining one
Who never thought his growth was done,

But always sought to better be
Through strength of mind and spirit free.
When old beliefs must change their form
He'd weather through each mental storm

And rearrange his thoughts anew
To make his vision bright and true,
Always growing ever more
Than he had ever been before.

As Stomatos' sons arose
Like mighty strength that ever grows,
Great Hillu struck in raging might
Upon that prehistoric site.

So many lineages were lost
Through all their wandering, tempest-tossed,
Would be forgotten evermore
On that primeval, ancient shore.

The Coast of Three Kingdoms bright
Where life's great wisdom and its light
First met upon the virgin land
By Mithra's ever-guiding hand.

When plants and fungi chose to wed
While arthropods were daily fed
Upon their sacred partnership—
The first tri-partnership.

From sea to land each kingdom came,
Each one seeking its own fame.
But partnership proved best of all
Above pride's individual call.

The lichen cities clearly showed
How love's eternal seeds were sowed
Between the most unlike of kin
To share each other's discipline

Through life upon the fertile earth
Where partnership gives blessed birth
To beauty none could ever see
In isolation's lonely spree.

From Euthy's desperate, loving leap
To save her children from the deep
Came Myry's way of breathing air
Through holes pierced with greatest care.

From Cain and Abel's bitter strife
Came death transformed to newborn life:
Centipedes who hunt their prey
And millipedes who clear away

Decay to make the rich earth bloom
For new plants to dispel all gloom.
From fungi's patient, waiting love
Blessed by grace from high above

Came mushrooms with their mighty power
In earth's most dark and troubled hour.
From Stomatos' brave, changing heart
Came plants' wide range and living art.

The Coast of Three Kingdoms shows
How life's great wisdom ever grows
To find its truest, noblest way
Through partnership's bright display.
