# Chapter 44: The Crustacean Determination (DRAFT)

While mighty Trilobites ruled the seas
With their great and proud dynasties,
The rivers flowed so swift and free
For lesser brethren's sacred spree.

The sons of brave Arachnus ruled complete
The seas where they would always meet
To school their children in the art
Of playing well their ocean part.

The sons of great Insectus took
The rivers like an open book
Of endless opportunities
For all their small communities.

The sons of Cain and Abel strong
Ruled the lands their whole life long,
Quite able to make living there
In terrestrial morning air.

And so great Crustaceus could see
No place without some flaw to be
Where he could make his noble stand
In sea or stream or fertile land.

Yet nowhere left for him to go,
He tried despite his heavy woe
To establish his bloodline bright
With dynasty of sacred might.

For heaven rewards the faithful heart
That plays determination's vital part
To rise above all earthly plight
And reach for glory's greater height.

Great Crustaceus bore two sons so true:
Bold Karkon and brave Mushi too,
Each son destined to find his way
Through life from night into the day.

Great Mushi bore two sons of worth:
Bold Copepus from his birth,
And strange Lepipus throughout his range
Who'd prove to be beyond all change.

Great Copepus became the sire
Of copepods' celestial choir—
The little ones so small and bright
Who answer ocean's sacred sight.

Like insects of every form divine
Through calm and storm their lives would shine
As they swam throughout the sea
In their sweet complexity.

The tiniest of all who hear
The ocean's call both far and near,
They dance throughout the waves so free
In their microscopic spree.

Meanwhile bold Lepipus bore with care
Two sons beyond compare:
Great Brachios of the boundless sea
And swift Silvio running free.

A daughter fair of Silvio's line
Would someday help the flow divine
Of insects to the promised land
By evolution's guiding hand.

Some day when millions hence would pass,
The sons of Silvio's noble class
Would become the insects great
That would the earth dominate.

The world in every sacred place
Would know their six-legged grace,
But that day was not yet near—
They had to persevere.

Great Brachios became father true
Of sea monkeys (why pursue
Complex names when simple's best?)
And water fleas among the rest.

In natural habitat so fair
They lived with neither want nor care:
Sea monkeys in their crystal pools
And water fleas like precious jewels.

Dancing through the water bright,
Each son and daughter pure delight
Living simple lives so sweet
Where small beauties always meet.

Great Karkon fled far away
To open waters wide and gray
Where he begat two sons of fame:
Bold Pancer to explore and claim,

And wise Cephalocaridus
Most glorious and prosperous,
Each finding their appointed way
Through life from night into the day.

Great Pancer bore in sacred time
Two sons in their youthful prime:
Small Oligostracus so true
And tall Polycruster too.

Bold Oligostracus bore with might
Many sons to bring delight
To waters far and waters wide
With courage as their faithful guide.

Among his sons were always found
The seed shrimp, safe and sound,
And sad, degenerate tongue worms who
Broke from what was right and true.

These tongue worms chose to live in shame
As parasites without a name
Who give nothing back in trade—
Poor choices they have always made.

Instead of getting honest jobs
Like other hardworking mobs,
They live off others' faithful work
And in the shadows always lurk.

Great Polycruster bore sons two:
Bold Barnacus, forever true,
And strong Malacus who'd live long
With courage ever brave and strong.

Great Barnacus was a man
Who had a noble frontier plan,
A great frontiersman he would be
Who lived quite happily.

He settled down with stalk so tall
Upon the ground to walk no more,
But live instead like those who call
The cnidarian shore their home.

Like sons of great Cnider's line
He lived his life serene and fine
Attached unto the solid ground
Where he had settled down.

Great Barnacus bore a son
He named great Goose when day begun,
And Goose was he who built with care
Society beyond compare.

Most wondrous to behold it was,
But truth be told—just because
No matter how he tried with pride
And all his efforts magnified,

He never did become in truth
A goose (though some from youth
Still claim his lineage blessed
Is goose heritage expressed).

Yet Goose still claimed his sons were true
Were geese when day was born anew,
And so he is the faithful guide
Of geese with sacred, holy pride.

The Elohim of Geese is he,
He brings them sweet harmony
And guides them on their destined way
Throughout each blessed, holy day.

In medieval lore so bright
They told with great delight
Of how the geese would always grow
From barnacles hanging low.

Hanging from the trees on high
In shells beneath the sky
Until they could grow feathers fair
In every kind of weather's care.

And fly away at last in time
When growing season's prime had passed,
Gerald of Wales did tell
This story known so well.

Among the sons of Goose so true
Many would pursue
Their size and grow quite small
And compact, one and all.

They became Barnacles bright
Like miracles of pure light—
Half shrimp and half coral fair,
Full animals with souls to share.

Living moral lives upon the stone
Like shepherd with flock alone
They filter from the sea
Their food quite happily.

Great Malacus bore descendants
More than any could ever count,
Throughout the years ascendants
To glory's sacred mount.

Among them crabs so bold and true
And shrimp whose stories ever new
Tell of grace beneath the waves
In their sacred ocean caves.

The isopods were dwelling there
And amphipods everywhere,
Each playing their appointed part
In evolution's sacred art.

They would become a dynasty
So great in their victory
That none could match their blessed might
In future's dawning light.

So great that when we speak with awe
Of Crustaceus' sacred law
We speak first and foremost true
Of Malacus' retinue.

Whose dynasty was yet to reach
The glory that would teach
All others in the time to come
When they would overcome.

Under Trilobites' gentle yoke
They lived like blessed folk
Awaiting their appointed day
When they would lead the way.

But patience is the sacred key
To life's great mystery,
The crustaceans learned to wait
For their appointed fate.

From Crustaceus' noble start
With determination's faithful heart
To rise above his earthly plight
And reach for heaven's height,

Came lineages strong and true
That would their whole lives through
Fill the seas with forms so bright
Through calm and stormy night.

The copepods dancing small and free
Who answer ocean's sacred plea,
The barnacles upon the rocks
Like shepherds with their faithful flocks,

The crabs with claws of might so strong,
The shrimp that swim along
The ocean's currents swift and free,
All from one family tree.

That started with one soul so brave
Who would not be a slave
To circumstances dark and dire
But reached for something higher.

In every tiny copepod bright
Dancing like pure light
Throughout the ocean blue so deep,
Remember truth to keep:

That size does not determine fate
Or make a spirit great—
The smallest can achieve renown
If they won't be cast down.

To try despite the odds arrayed
Against them, unafraid,
Trusting heaven to reward
Determination's sacred sword.

In every barnacle that grows
Like miracle that shows
Upon the rocky shore so grand
Where waves forever strand,

Remember those who journey not
Through space but time's lot
To find their perfect harmony
With life's eternal symphony.

The sons of great Crustaceus show
How those who will not bow
To circumstance or cruel fate
Can rise to something great.

Though Trilobites held mighty sway
In that ancient day,
The future would reveal in time
What healing's sacred rhyme

Would bring: that patient persistence true
And faithful existence through
Will triumph in the final end
When time becomes their friend.

From rivers to the boundless sea,
From bondage to the free,
The crustaceans would arise
To claim their destined prize.

But that is yet to come to pass
When current ages' mass
Of lessons sum to wisdom bright
Of life's eternal light.

For now they wait and grow in grace
And learn to find their place,
To be ready for the day
When they will lead the way.

In patience they find strength divine,
In time they learn the line
Of preparation that they need
For when their time's freed.

Heaven rewards those who dare
To reach beyond despair
Of present circumstance so small
To future's grander call.

Great Crustaceus showed the way
That leads to greater day:
Determination burning true
Will see all struggles through.
