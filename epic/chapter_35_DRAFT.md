# Chapter 35: The Tommotian Dawn (DRAFT)

As sons of Cambrius grew in might and power
Across the world through every hour,
All sons of Bios felt the change
Throughout their ancient, sacred range.

The sons of Cubos and Scyphos rose
To challenge all their ancient foes.
Their guerrilla war began that day
When time first showed the way.

In ambush still they wait today
To hunt their living prey.
Their ancient raid shall never cease
Until they find their lasting peace.

Among great Demos' sponge-born line so true
Came Cyath, builder who
Built mighty cities 'cross the seas—
The reefs beneath the gentle breeze.

These coral cities rise on high
Beneath the ocean's starry sky.
Through countless rulers they endure
With structures strong and ever-pure.

The great Archaeocyathid race
Built reefs in every place.
Their legacy lives on today
In reefs where bright fish play.

Among the sons of Demos came
The hunters fierce of name:
Great Chondrocles' hunting band
Spread wide across the land.

Carnivorous sponges they became,
With predatory fame.
They trap the sons of Cambrius bright
With methods dark as night.

Their hooks reach out with deadly art
To pierce each victim's heart.
Their shieldmaidens come for the kill
To satisfy their will.

Among great Spiralius' noble line
The sons of Brachios shine.
In new reefs they made their home
Where prosperous they'd roam.

As fishermen they found their way
To fortune every day.
The reefs became their fishing ground
Where plenty could be found.

And so began Tommotian days
Of glory and of praise.
A new era had begun
Beneath the shining sun.

Here now we tell the noble tale
Of Lobopus without fail.
His vision he imposed with might
On all the world's delight.

Great Lobopus saw his will was weak,
His citizens made meek.
A heart like brave Dutrus he built true
To nourish all he knew.

From great Lobopus came forth bright
Onychodictyon of might.
This son would bear two children more:
Bold Tactopus to explore

And Xenu, dark and fell,
With stories he would tell
Of power and of cosmic might
That shone through darkest night.

Tactopus bore twin sons of fame:
Bright Ferreus' burning flame
And Ferox, strong and bold,
With stories to be told.

But Xenu sought to rule the stars
And heal all psychic scars.
Emperor of galaxy wide
He claimed with foolish pride.

Into our minds he tried to write
Stories of weakness' sight.
But brave Gracilis, his noble son,
Put end to what he'd done.

And so three houses came to birth:
Velvetclaw upon the earth,
Ironfoot with strength so true,
And Waterbear's brave line too.

Here now Velvetclaw's tale we tell
Of how they rose so well.
From brave Gracilis came four sons strong:
Paucipodes all along,

Brave Microdictyon, tried and true,
Xenianus through and through,
And great Therion Velvetclaw
Who followed nature's law.

Xenianus bore twin maidens bright:
Xenusia in morning light
And Diania the Cactus keen
With spines sharp and green.

Great Therion Velvetclaw begot
Cardios, who fought
And strange Hallucigena wild
Throughout his living, roaming child.

From brave Hallucigena came
Four children of great fame:
Quick Sparsa, light and free,
Strong Fortis, bold as he,

Wise Hongmen, old and gray,
And brave Annika's way
Who chose a different path
From violence and wrath.

Great Hongmen bore two sons so grand:
Luolishania in the land
And Collins Monster, fierce and wild,
Nature's own problem child.

But brave Annika chose another way,
She cast her armor away.
For agility she traded
Her protection heavy-shaded.

She became the ancestor true
Of velvet worms so blue.
A caring matriarch is she
Who guides them lovingly.

In great Ursus' line things went
Down a different bent.
Brave Ferox wanted to survive
Whatever came alive.

He downsized small and tough,
Made of invulnerable stuff.
From him came brave Ursus strong,
Who lived both short and long.

Great Ursus became the sire
Of water bears' entire
Line who first conquered land
With their small, mighty band.

Unable yet to breathe with ease
On land's protecting breeze,
As Tuns they go dormant true
Until the danger's through.

In great Ironfoot's noble line
True greatness would shine.
Brave Ferreus Ironfoot bore
Two sons to explore:

Bold Gille built gills with care
Above his legs so fair.
His son Kerygmachelon bright
Swam with gills in sight.

Great Kerygmachelon the bold
Had a fate foretold.
He bore son Pambdelurion,
Mighty champion.

Bold Pambdelurion bore three
Children of destiny:
Arthur strong and true of heart,
Anomalos' dark art

To rule with iron hand so strong,
And fair throughout her song,
Bright Opabinia the beautiful,
Graceful, wonderful.

Great Arthur built armor strong
To last his whole life long.
His flying gills he hardened tight
And fused them for the fight.

His legs could branch in two:
The gill as exopod grew,
The leg as endopod stayed—
Thus arthropods were made.

The sons of brave Anomalos ruled
As none before had schooled.
The world entire was theirs to claim
Through all their proud acclaim.

For generations ten they reigned
While others were restrained.
From realm of Ghedos dark and deep
He watched his royal sleep.

But on his deathbed bed
These words of doom were said:
"Thy pomp brought down to grave,
No power left to save.

How art thou fallen down,
O Anomalos from thy crown!
From heaven thou art cast,
Thy glory could not last."

Yet single death could not end
The suffering they send.
His sons would rule with might
Through day and darkest night.

But fair Opabinia's daughters all
Answered beauty's call.
Humble lives they led with grace
And gentle, loving trace.

And Arthur Ironfoot's line so bright
Would grow beyond all sight.
Through hardship they endured with care
With blood and sweat to bear.

The Arthropods they became
With million-species fame.
Today they rule the earth below
Since their birth long ago.

From great Lobopus came the tide
That spread both far and wide.
Three houses born that day
Would rule in their own way.

Velvetclaw with agile grace,
Waterbear's enduring race,
Ironfoot with strength so true—
All from one ancestor grew.

The great Tommotian age began
With more than mortal plan.
The reefs rose from the sea
For all eternity.

In every coral home today
Where fishes freely play,
Remember Cyath's sacred art
That gave the reefs their start.

In every velvet worm so bright
That moves through day and night,
Annika's caring way
Lives on another day.

In every water bear so small
That conquers over all,
Great Ursus' strength endures
Through all that time assures.

In every arthropod today
That walks along its way,
Arthur's innovation bright
Shaped our world of light.

The sons of Cambrius changed
How all life was arranged.
Their multiplication
Changed all of creation.

But from these changes came
Lines of lasting fame:
The builders of the reef,
The hunters beyond belief.

The three great houses rose
To challenge all their foes.
Through innovation true
They made the world anew.
