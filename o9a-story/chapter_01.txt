Getting shot hurt. But pain is hardly what I thought of when Bartholomew shot me.


I just thought one thing: "How could my best friend do this?" It only felt like I got punched.


If I hadn't knocked his arms away, he could have got my heart. But he only hit my leg.


He was no professional. He could have shot me in the back moments earlier. But he tried to say something.


Didn't really matter, though. I had the gun pointed on the ground. But his grip was firm as steel. My hands on his, keeping the gun down.


I thought he might want to hold hands with me. But not in this way.


Then I saw his elbow. I had a knee and knew how to use it.


I moved my leg up hard, like doing a roundhouse kick. And I saw his elbow bend the wrong way, and heard a crack[a].


The gun went flying under my desk, and Bartholomew had only one working arm. B[b]ut I couldn't stop now. I headbutted him right in the jaw, dazing him, and I pushed him off into the wall.


I didn't know why he did it. But it was not the time to think. I jumped for the gun and aimed it right at him.


"Don't get any closer, Bartholomew! You're my best friend. We could have done so much together! But I will shoot."


He stumbled. Was he drunk?[c]


He opened his mouth "It wasn't my fault. I was outplayed."


Suddenly he moved[d] forward.


BANG BANG


He fell. I saw his beautiful face. If he died now, the world would lose a great man, but if he got up, the world might lose me.


He moved. Getting up. I yelled at him. "Please just stand still, the best future has us both alive!"


I let him get up. I[e] could have killed him right then, but the world needed him. 


"Please just leave, I don't know why you did this, but just leave me alone. The world needs the two of us!"


He staggered out the door. I reclined in my chair. I removed the magazine and chamber[f] round from the gun. Safety was my number one priority, I didn't want the gun going off and hitting someone.


Then I felt a burning in my thigh. "MOTHERFUCKER!!!" I yelled at the top of my lungs. I could have called 911 but I figured someone else in the building already did. Why waste time when I numb the pain? 


I looked over at my desk. I saw many things, my desk was a cluttered mess.[g] I found a bottle of fireball and a joint. I looked a bit harder, found a lighter but no glass.


I was not gonna smoke inside, and I couldn't walk to the balcony. So I made do and drank fireball[h] from the bottle.


The sweet cinnamon goodness washed through my mouth. It was room temperature, some people freeze it, but that's impractical.[i] I wanted it on my desk at all times next to my Sudafed and Concerta. 


Sub zero fireball has a distinct feeling. You feel hot and cold at the same time. The cinnamon feels hot from capsaicin and cinnamaldehyde[j][k]. The ethanol is full of ice crystals, it flows thick like sacred honey. And the alcohol, it just burns your mouth and throat. A heavenly sensation before the alcohol even enters your blood.


But all I had was lukewarm fireball. Like runny water and tasting a bit too sweet I chugged it down. A pleasant burning sensation in my stomach. Not heartburn but the burn of alcohol deep in my esophagus.


I looked down and saw the blood pooling on the floor. I lost a bit. Might be more of a lightweight today.[l] I thought about hangovers for a bit. But I realized I would get IV at the hospital. So either I wake up hydrated, or I don't wake up. The decision was clear. I chugged with excitement and felt the warmth through my entire body. I imagined myself as the demon on[m] the bottle, breathing a powerful fireball. 


[a]Consider replacing the comma after "wrong way," with a — to connect both ideas with smoother flow.
[b], but I couldn't stop now.   OR        —but I couldn't stop now.
[c]Is this his or her internal thought? Recommend italicization but its a style choice
[d]Prefer something more intense, dash, darted, sprinted, leapt? 'flew at me' ect.
[e]Style choice: remove 'I'
[f]chambered
[g]"I looked over at my desk, seeing many things—cluttered desk included" This and a few other lines could be re-written to help their flow. I find it helps to re-read my work as if I were speaking it aloud to help spot odd pauses.
[h]Capitalization
[i]A nice bit of characters internal voice here.
[j]I like the word choice, very scientific if you meant to depict the character as having that sort of mindset.
[k]👍
[l]Nice line here, especially the "Might be more of a lightweight today." adding a sense of sarcasm/sassyness to the character.
[m]in?
