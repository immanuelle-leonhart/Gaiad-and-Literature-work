# Gaiad Project Context

## Project Overview
The Gaiad Project is a comprehensive cosmological mythology that combines:
- **Epic Poetry**: Cosmological creation myth in iambic pentameter with ABAB rhyme scheme
- **Genealogical Records**: GEDCOM files tracking mythological lineages and characters
- **Multi-format Evolution**: Stories exist in both old prose/verse format and new structured markdown chapters

## Chapter Correspondence Issue
**IMPORTANT**: The chapter numbering between old and new versions does NOT correspond directly. The content has been completely reorganized and restructured.

### Current Status
- **New Format**: Chapters 1-20 (markdown files in `epic/`)
- **Old Format**: Chapters 1-53 (text files in `epic/old-versions/`)
- **Content Mapping**: Requires manual analysis to determine which old chapters correspond to which new chapters

### Key Examples of Non-Correspondence
- **Old Chapter 11**: Environmental crisis, oxygen toxicity, Fimbulwinter
- **New Chapter 19**: "The Euka Epic" - cellular organelles and biological structures
- **New Chapter 20**: "The Legacy of Euka" - continuation of cellular biology theme

## Working Notes
- The new format appears to be a complete restructuring rather than a simple conversion
- Some old content may not have been adapted yet
- Need comprehensive mapping to understand what content exists where
- User manually revised `Gaiad.ged` file and it's now complete

## Chapter Content Analysis

### New Chapters (1-20) - Structured Epic Poetry
- **Format**: Iambic pentameter, ABAB rhyme scheme, consistent stanza structure
- **Style**: Polished, literary, formatted markdown
- **Content**: Tells a cohesive love story of Aster and Andromeda across cosmic scales
- **Themes**: Creation myth, romance, cosmic journey, cellular biology (later chapters)

### Old Chapters (1-53) - Original Prose/Verse
- **Format**: Mixed prose and verse, less structured
- **Style**: Raw, experimental, stream-of-consciousness elements  
- **Content**: Broader mythological universe with different focus
- **Themes**: Twin deities, conflict with Hillu, LUCA origin story, environmental crises

### Key Finding: NO DIRECT CORRESPONDENCE
The old and new chapters are **completely different stories** set in the same mythological universe. They are not revisions of each other but separate tellings.

**Examples:**
- New Ch. 1: Aster the catgirl with yarn creating universe
- Old Ch. 1: Divine twins (Brother/Sister, Yin Yang) growing rapidly
- New Ch. 5: Aster making "milk pregnant with cat seed" 
- Old Ch. 5: Hillu's destructive campaign against star children
- New Ch. 10: Peaceful moon Serenitide, migration story
- Old Ch. 10: Lucas and Freyja as LUCA ancestors

## Chapter Content Mapping

### New Chapter 22: "The Great Diversification"
**Source**: Old Chapter 13 detailed genealogies (Plastidus→Glauca/Alges/Alga, Haroses lineages, endosymbiosis events)
**Content**: Detailed algae evolution, endosymbiotic theft, diatoms, kelp forests, Solar Coalition, protist diversification

### New Chapter 23: "The Gamma Ray Catastrophe"

**Content**: Choanoflagellate evolution, colonial organization, cell specialization, mesoderm/endoderm development, Volvox-Choan's kingdom, Carcinoma's rebellion

### New Chapter 25: "Carcinoma's Revolution"
**Source**: Old Chapter 16 (Carcinoma's transformation, Animal Kingdom founding)
**Content**: Cancer biology, cellular revolution, Gehenna utopia/dystopia, Anima+Metazo exodus, Animal Kingdom establishment, sponge-like organization

## Next Steps
1. Continue with descendants of the four children of Nectarius
2. Use old chapters 13-20 for source material on plant/animal/fungi evolution
3. Follow the genealogical relationships faithfully from old chapters
