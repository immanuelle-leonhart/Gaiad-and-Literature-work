# Gaiad Project Context

## Project Overview
The Gaiad Project is a comprehensive cosmological mythology that combines:
- **Epic Poetry**: Cosmological creation myth in iambic pentameter with ABAB rhyme scheme
- **Genealogical Records**: GEDCOM files tracking mythological lineages and characters
- **Multi-format Evolution**: Stories exist in both old prose/verse format and new structured markdown chapters

## Chapter Correspondence Issue
**IMPORTANT**: The chapter numbering between old and new versions does NOT correspond directly. The content has been completely reorganized and restructured.

### Current Status
- **New Format**: Chapters 1-20 (markdown files in `epic/`)
- **Old Format**: Chapters 1-53 (text files in `epic/old-versions/`)
- **Content Mapping**: Requires manual analysis to determine which old chapters correspond to which new chapters

### Key Examples of Non-Correspondence
- **Old Chapter 11**: Environmental crisis, oxygen toxicity, Fimbulwinter
- **New Chapter 19**: "The Euka Epic" - cellular organelles and biological structures
- **New Chapter 20**: "The Legacy of Euka" - continuation of cellular biology theme

## Working Notes
- The new format appears to be a complete restructuring rather than a simple conversion
- Some old content may not have been adapted yet
- Need comprehensive mapping to understand what content exists where
- User manually revised `Gaiad.ged` file and it's now complete

## Chapter Content Analysis

### New Chapters (1-20) - Structured Epic Poetry
- **Format**: Iambic pentameter, ABAB rhyme scheme, consistent stanza structure
- **Style**: Polished, literary, formatted markdown
- **Content**: Tells a cohesive love story of Aster and Andromeda across cosmic scales
- **Themes**: Creation myth, romance, cosmic journey, cellular biology (later chapters)

### Old Chapters (1-53) - Original Prose/Verse
- **Format**: Mixed prose and verse, less structured
- **Style**: Raw, experimental, stream-of-consciousness elements  
- **Content**: Broader mythological universe with different focus
- **Themes**: Twin deities, conflict with Hillu, LUCA origin story, environmental crises

### Key Finding: NO DIRECT CORRESPONDENCE
The old and new chapters are **completely different stories** set in the same mythological universe. They are not revisions of each other but separate tellings.

**Examples:**
- New Ch. 1: Aster the catgirl with yarn creating universe
- Old Ch. 1: Divine twins (Brother/Sister, Yin Yang) growing rapidly
- New Ch. 5: Aster making "milk pregnant with cat seed" 
- Old Ch. 5: Hillu's destructive campaign against star children
- New Ch. 10: Peaceful moon Serenitide, migration story
- Old Ch. 10: Lucas and Freyja as LUCA ancestors

## Chapter Correspondence Summary
- **Chapters 1-25**: Original creation myth (Aster/Andromeda love story, cellular evolution, eukaryotic kingdoms)
- **Chapters 26-62**: Systematic conversion of old chapters 17-53, maintaining strict genealogical accuracy while converting prose to iambic pentameter with ABAB rhyme scheme. Each new chapter follows the exact genealogical relationships and evolutionary innovations described in the corresponding old chapter.

**Total Epic Length**: 62 chapters covering the complete cosmological mythology from universe creation through Carboniferous period.

## File Handling Guidelines
**IMPORTANT**: When working with GEDCOM files or any data files:
- **ALWAYS OVERWRITE existing files** instead of creating new ones
- This produces proper diffs in GitHub that can be analyzed and studied
- Preserves version control history and allows for better tracking of changes
- Use existing file paths when modifying genealogical data

## GEDCOM File Handling
**CRITICAL**: Large GEDCOM files are NOT meant for direct parsing or analysis:
- **DO NOT attempt to parse** large GEDCOM files (>1MB) directly with Python scripts
- GEDCOM files are text but not human-readable - use specialized tools only
- **Use existing Python programs** in `gedcom_tools/` folder for GEDCOM processing
- Large files will timeout or exhaust resources if parsed directly
- All GEDCOM manipulation should go through dedicated tools in `gedcom_tools/`
