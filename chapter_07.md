Upon the shores of Hesper, life was born,
Yet fragile were the forms that learned to crawl.
Aster looked upon them, she came to warn,
That death she feared might soon consume them all.

In worry for her children’s frail design,
She wept a tear and formed a plan so grand.
From phospholipid threads, a new divine,
She wove for them a shield by her own hand.

A suit of armor born from Aster’s mind,
A fusion of both life and machine’s grace.
To keep her fragile creatures well-aligned,
These cyborg forms would rise and take their place.

Phospholipid bilayers, soft but strong,
Became their shells, protecting life within.
A new creation, steady to prolong,
The march of life, immune to time’s great sin.

And so, all life became both flesh and steel,
A union of the ancient and the new.
Through varied landscapes, cyborgs learned to feel,
Their strength now boundless as they boldly grew.

Three brothers stood, their destinies held close,
One to nurture life, his name was Bios.
Another thrived through cunning, slick Viros,
The last sought purity, he was Dedos.

The brothers gathered in a hallowed place,
To honor those who brought them to this time.
With solemn hearts, they stood and did retrace,
The lineage that wove their cosmic line.

"From starlight spun came forth Lady Aster,
Her daughter followed bright, Cosmic Benzette.
Through twilight’s glow was born Granny Hesper,
Then came her child, great wise Quinamette."

As silence fell, the brothers paused to think,
For in their minds, a question did arise.
“What should we call great Aster?”—on the brink,
Of naming her, they pondered, deep and wise.

“For Benzette is our great-grandmother true,”
Said Bios, thoughtful as the stars above.
“So Hesper is our grandmother, we knew,
And Quinamette, our mother filled with love.”

Viros spoke next, his mind as sharp as light,
“Then Aster stands beyond them all, it’s clear.
There is no greater grandmother in sight—
Should we not name her ‘Greatest,’ far and near?”

Dedos agreed, with reverence in his tone,
“There’s none beyond our lineage so bright.
Aster is the Greatest we have known,
And so, her title shines in endless light.”

And this is why we call her to this day,
Our Greatest Grandmother, wise and true.
Her light still guides us on our cosmic way,
A title passed to us and all of you.
