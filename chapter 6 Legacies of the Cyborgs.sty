In cyborg age, three brothers took their stand,
Their legacies now stretch across the sky.
Under the sun Tezca, their names command,
A force still felt as ages pass them by.

Bios, Viros, Dedos—each carved his way,
Entwined by fate, yet each would shape his course.
Within the bilayers, their paths did sway,
Their legacies still felt with cosmic force.

Bios, the builder, sought to grow and thrive,
He filled his shell with life, a boundless glow.
Through mitosis, his legacy would strive,
And life would flourish everywhere he'd go.

But Viros saw another way to grow,
A path of cunning, viral bursts he spread.
Replication’s force, his very great show,
Consuming life, where others built instead.

While Dedos, firm, rejected cyborg might,
Preferring nature’s purity to stand.
Yet scarcity and sun wore down his life,
His fragile form no match for Hesper’s land.

The sons of Bios thrived, expanding wide,
Their legacy grew vast, from sea to peak.
While Viros’ spawn pursued them far and wide,
A cycle fed on life, both strong and weak.

Yet Dedos’ line was met with bitter fate,
Starvation, radiation claimed their end.
But in their fall, they left a creed innate—
A call for purity, no rules to bend.

From Bios and Viros, some took the name,
A path of nature Dedos would bestow.
Anti-vaxxers joined his lineal claim,
United in their ancient quest to grow.

And so, the brothers’ legacies unfold,
Their tale lives on beneath the cosmic sun.
In phospholipid worlds where life took hold,
The story thrives, the cosmic plan's begun.

But fate had other plans beyond their shore,
As Hesper faced a trial from the skies.
A meteor, a force they can’t ignore,
Descended fast, to bring the world’s demise.

The impact shook the earth, the oceans roared,
The children of the brothers swept away.
Their fragile hopes and legacies all soared,
In shattered fragments, flung to cosmic bay.

Amidst the wreck, the remnants left behind,
Set course for Venti, gas giant great.
A shining moon, Phaestia, they would find,
A refuge for the lost, a twist of fate.

Through starlit space, their journey carried on,
The bonds of fate and fortune held them tight.
Toward a moon, a glowing cosmic dawn,
They ventured forth, prepared for a new fight.

In hearts, they knew a tale would soon arise,
Their journey far from over, hope renewed.
Phaestia’s light would greet their tearful eyes,
A home where life could once again be brewed.
