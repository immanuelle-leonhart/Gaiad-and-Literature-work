&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;Introduction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Protestant Reformation did not merely reinterpret Christian doctrine; it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;recast the very structure of religious life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;in early modern Europe. In predominantly Catholic medieval Europe, &amp;ldquo;embodied&amp;rdquo; religion centered on communal ritual, sacramental symbols, and mythic cosmologies (the saints, the Mass as sacrifice, pilgrimages, indulgences, etc.). Protestantism, by contrast, prized &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;inner faith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;&amp;nbsp;and Scripture, subordinating outward ceremony to personal conviction and doctrine. This shift can be seen as a flattening of the old mythic order into a self&amp;#8209;enclosed, rationalized belief system. We analyze this transformation through a post-structuralist lens (especially Foucault&amp;rsquo;s concept of discipline and power) while drawing on sociology (Weber&amp;rsquo;s Protestant Ethic), intellectual history (Taylor on secular experience), and political economy (the reallocation of church wealth). Each section addresses one facet of the Reformation&amp;rsquo;s restructuring of religion.&lt;/span&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;Economic Entanglements: Reformation and Early Capitalism&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;span class="c7"&gt;The Reformation emerged amid the breakdown of feudal order and the rise of commercial capitalism. As Cantoni &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;et al.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;demonstrate, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;massive resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(land, wealth, human capital) shifted from ecclesiastical to secular hands. Closed monasteries and confiscated church lands funded palaces, roads, and civic institutions in Protestant territories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nber.org/papers/w23934%23:~:text%3DUsing%2520novel%2520microdata%252C%2520we%2520document,This%2520transfer%2520of%2520resources%2520had&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805528279&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0PI4WK8vXe1WFLNKayc9y-"&gt;nber.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. Cantoni, Dittmar, and Yuchtman (2017) find that &amp;ldquo;secular authorities acquired enormous amounts of wealth from monasteries closed during the Reformation,&amp;rdquo; and that Protestant regions saw new investment in non&amp;#8209;religious buildings (palaces, town halls)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nber.org/papers/w23934%23:~:text%3DUsing%2520novel%2520microdata%252C%2520we%2520document,This%2520transfer%2520of%2520resources%2520had&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805528831&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0Ur-v35BZHIwywFBFPOA3g"&gt;nber.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nber.org/papers/w23934%23:~:text%3Dfor%2520public%2520sector%2520jobs%252C%2520rather,the%2520secularization%2520of%2520the%2520West&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805528988&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2sIcwWfPxMYKTN8zlpsTcm"&gt;nber.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. This &amp;ldquo;reallocation&amp;rdquo; of resources &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;powered emerging bourgeois classes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;and civil bureaucracy (many graduates of Protestant universities went into public service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nber.org/papers/w23934%23:~:text%3Dacquired%2520enormous%2520amounts%2520of%2520wealth,palaces%2520and%2520administrative%2520buildings%252C%2520which&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805529567&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2G1T0rc0-fJKzjlh6jOA1v"&gt;nber.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;). In short, Protestant reform created an economic base for capitalist society by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;diverting church rent&amp;#8209;seeking into profit&amp;#8209;seeking and state formation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nber.org/papers/w23934%23:~:text%3DUsing%2520novel%2520microdata%252C%2520we%2520document,This%2520transfer%2520of%2520resources%2520had&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805529976&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3_UqrWBzlws0-3Nrn03GG6"&gt;nber.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nber.org/papers/w23934%23:~:text%3Dfor%2520public%2520sector%2520jobs%252C%2520rather,the%2520secularization%2520of%2520the%2520West&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805530184&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3WjvHsbkowgUCEsmgDSKEm"&gt;nber.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c7"&gt;Max Weber&amp;rsquo;s classic analysis similarly links Protestant doctrine to capitalist subjectivity. Weber noted that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;inner-worldly asceticism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the &amp;ldquo;calling&amp;rdquo; or Beruf &amp;ndash; was given a religious stamp by Luther and especially Calvin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://anthropolojamz.wordpress.com/2015/10/11/weber-the-protestant-ethic-and-the-spirit-of-capitalism/%23:~:text%3DLuther%25E2%2580%2599s%2520Concept%2520of%2520the%2520Calling&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805530870&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3BFLAdQvyjZy19KDhGy1iX"&gt;anthropolojamz.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.stanford.edu/~avner/Greif_228_2005/Ekelund%2520et%2520al%25202002%2520JPE%2520Reformation.pdf%23:~:text%3D%25E2%2580%25A2,control%2520of%2520the%2520individual%2520which&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805531085&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1pCBeyB55XlqtDblpSjeob"&gt;web.stanford.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. Luther proclaimed in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;On Christian Liberty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1520) that &amp;ldquo;A Christian man is the most free lord of all, and subject to none; [yet] a Christian man is the most dutiful servant of all, and subject to every one&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ccel.org/ccel/luther/christianliberty/christianliberty.iii.html%23:~:text%3Dspiritual%2520liberty%2520and%2520servitude%253A%25E2%2580%2594&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805531538&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1Z12JAeYP6Qdz5mp-SaXYS"&gt;ccel.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. This paradoxical doctrine of inner freedom under God laid the groundwork for a self&amp;#8209;disciplined individual.

&lt;span class="c7"&gt;Moreover, Protestant political theory often justified the sovereign taking the place of the church. In the Holy Roman Empire, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;cuius regio, eius religio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1555) allowed princes to seize former Catholic lands and impose state churches. Cantoni &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;et al.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;note that this secularizing impulse was unintended but profound: Protestant &amp;ldquo;entry&amp;rdquo; was facilitated by emergent market societies willing to bear wealth into new &amp;ldquo;utility-maximizing&amp;rdquo; (in their terminology) contractual relations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.stanford.edu/~avner/Greif_228_2005/Ekelund%2520et%2520al%25202002%2520JPE%2520Reformation.pdf%23:~:text%3Dhomoge%2502neous%2520event,absolutely%2520decisive%2520difference%2520from%2520Catholicism&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805534647&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3UR2OSLlehdPfUrPjTnoBX"&gt;web.stanford.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nber.org/papers/w23934%23:~:text%3DUsing%2520novel%2520microdata%252C%2520we%2520document,This%2520transfer%2520of%2520resources%2520had&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805534808&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2r9GEunBEZ2PK3ffx1qBsE"&gt;nber.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;.

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;Iconoclasm and Ritual Decoding&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;span class="c7"&gt;Protestant reformers launched an explicit attack on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;Catholic ritual and imagery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. Initially, this took the form of iconoclasm: the mass destruction of statues, altars, and stained glass in many German, Swiss, and Dutch cities. Luther himself tolerated some images, but Zwingli and Calvin often proclaimed them &amp;ldquo;idols,&amp;rdquo; to be purged. As one recent study notes, modern aesthetic theories of image and art were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;shaped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;by the Reformation&amp;rsquo;s iconophobia.

As a Catholic commentator observes, Protestant liturgy &amp;ldquo;emphasizes clarity and simplicity over mystery and complex ritual&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; congregants now saw sermons rather than a sacred sacrifice, and ministers faced the people rather than leading esoteric rites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2017/10/11/protestantism-in-the-catholic-church-the-emergence-of-a-shared-tradition/%23:~:text%3Dthat%2520have%2520influenced%2520the%2520way,of%2520Christ%2520over%2520these%2520elements&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805538550&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1-Wm-4e-Jx9DIGhXJH0N5H"&gt;catholicworldreport.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c7"&gt;This was more than aesthetic: the underlying theology reinterpreted every sacramental and seasonal symbol. The Mass ceased to be viewed as a mystical reenactment of Calvary; instead it became a commemorative Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper. Zwingli famously argued that Christ&amp;rsquo;s presence in Communion is spiritual, not corporeal &amp;ndash; a &amp;ldquo;memorial&amp;rdquo; meal for the faithful, not a magical transformation of bread. Luther retained a real presence but rescinded the Catholic notion of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;transubstantiation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;; Calvin spoke of a &amp;ldquo;mystical presence&amp;rdquo; but likewise rejected a physical sacrifice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://oxfordre.com/religion/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.001.0001/acrefore-9780199340378-e-375?p%3DemailAwV26k/57IYO.%26d%3D/10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.001.0001/acrefore-9780199340378-e-375%23:~:text%3DFor%2520Luther%252C%2520the%2520Supper%2520is,consists%2520of%2520the%2520participant%2527s&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805539521&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw02IU2_N76nN2x0dP2WqfnL"&gt;oxfordre.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. In effect, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;ritual time was flattened&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;&amp;nbsp;into Scripture: saints&amp;rsquo; days and feast-days were often abandoned (except, say, Christmas and Easter) in favor of the Sunday sermon. Liturgical calendar and sacramental seasons gave way to the printed Bible read on a weekly cycle.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c7"&gt;From a post-structuralist view, this was a &amp;ldquo;decoding&amp;rdquo; of mythic signs into propositional content. Jean-Luc Nancy points out that monotheism has always &amp;ldquo;withdrawn any myth or meaning from the world,&amp;rdquo; positing a God removed from history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://politicaltheology.com/jean-luc-nancy/%23:~:text%3Dorigins%2520of%2520the%2520West,rigorous%2520atheism%2520has%2520religious%2520roots&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805540315&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0o4jQFpvZd0XJze1cpx9h_"&gt;politicaltheology.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. Protestantism extended this logic: the divine was accessible only in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;unmediated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Word. As Nancy writes, modernity&amp;rsquo;s drive toward demythologization &amp;ndash; stripping narrative out of social life &amp;ldquo;in the name of &amp;hellip; reason [or] progress&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; actually stems from this &amp;ldquo;atheistic logic of monotheism&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://politicaltheology.com/jean-luc-nancy/%23:~:text%3DA%2520world%2520without%2520God%2520is,all%2520is%2520dethroned%2520but%2520capital&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805540798&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3UMz34vMKUSRYMqAwYWAW7"&gt;politicaltheology.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;. In other words, Protestantism&amp;rsquo;s assault on religious symbol was not against superstition alone but part of a deeper secularizing trajectory. Iconoclasm &amp;ldquo;dismantled&amp;rdquo; the old cosmos of signs so thoroughly that believers could only narrate history (biblical or moral) rather than feel mythic presence.&lt;/span&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;From Utopia to Discipline: Radical Sectarianism and Control&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;span class="c7"&gt;The Reformation unleashed utopian fervors, yet the Protestant mainstream quickly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;reined them in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;through political alliance and social discipline. Radical sects (Anabaptists, Munsterites, Familists, Spiritualists, etc.) envisioned Christian communities based on shared goods, visions of imminent apocalypse, and direct revelation. These were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;utopian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;projects &amp;ndash; calls to remake society along egalitarian or mystical lines. For example, M&amp;uuml;nster (1534&amp;ndash;35) briefly became an Anabaptist &amp;ldquo;New Jerusalem,&amp;rdquo; complete with communal property and polygamy under self-styled &amp;ldquo;King David&amp;rdquo; Jan van Leyden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gameo.org/index.php?title%3DM%25C3%25BCnster_Anabaptists%23:~:text%3Dbeen%2520sent%2520to%2520M%25C3%25BCnster%2520by,Others%2520were&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805542244&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2rdxhXzVqDJDCuMwIh4513"&gt;gameo.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gameo.org/index.php?title%3DM%25C3%25BCnster_Anabaptists%23:~:text%3DIn%2520addition%2520to%2520armed%2520resistance%252C,reading%2520Anabaptists&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805542416&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1253lWfygPxHslyMGLDlq9"&gt;gameo.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. One historian notes that M&amp;uuml;nster &amp;ldquo;became the refuge of all persecuted, desperate people and the &amp;lsquo;New Jerusalem&amp;rsquo; of radical Anabaptism,&amp;rdquo; drawing oppressed believers across Europe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gameo.org/index.php?title%3DM%25C3%25BCnster_Anabaptists%23:~:text%3Dbeen%2520sent%2520to%2520M%25C3%25BCnster%2520by,Others%2520were&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805542754&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1nRDmORx5MkdMCXjKHf_go"&gt;gameo.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;. The city was besieged by the bishop&amp;rsquo;s troops and retaken amid horrific carnage. With M&amp;uuml;nster&amp;rsquo;s fall, authorities in Protestant cities grew determined to suppress any communal experiment that threatened order.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c7"&gt;Why this turn from utopia to discipline? Partly because secular rulers (both Protestant princes and Catholic emperors) saw the economic and political threat these sects posed. Elders who repudiated private property or refused to swear loyalty to princes challenged the emerging territorial states. Thus Anabaptists were soon banned by both Protestant and Catholic magistrates; M&amp;uuml;nster&amp;rsquo;s leaders were tortured and executed as a warning. The mainstream reformers (Lutherans, Reformed) largely &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;disavowed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;&amp;nbsp;the radicals. Luther condemned peasant revolts (1525) on theological grounds, urging princes to &amp;ldquo;slay even his father and mother&amp;rdquo; if they rebelled against order (a brutal stance to preserve peace). The Reformed in Zurich executed Anabaptists as heretics (e.g. Michael Sattler in 1527). In England and Scandinavia, even moderate Protestants under monarchy outlawed sects that undermined royal control of the church.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c7"&gt;This &amp;ldquo;re-disciplining&amp;rdquo; of utopian excess can be read through Foucault&amp;rsquo;s lens of power and subjectivation. Lindholm and Di Carlo (2024) argue that early Lutheranism already displayed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;disciplinary power&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;: church services functioned like classrooms, training obedient subjects. In a famous Wittenberg altarpiece (by Cranach), Luther preaches from a pulpit to rapt congregants &amp;ndash; a tableau much like Foucault&amp;rsquo;s classroom illustration of surveillance and normalization. Here the minister &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;the teacher; the congregation &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;the disciplined class learning not Latin prayers but a doctrine. Foucault&amp;rsquo;s concept of anatomo-politics applies: the Reformation increasingly positioned each soul under watchful guidance of preaching, catechism, and moral &amp;ldquo;calling.&amp;rdquo; By the mid-1500s, Protestant pastors and consistories oversaw schooling, poor relief, and even punishments for sins like adultery or Sabbath-breaking. Paradoxically, Protestants who celebrated individual faith also created tighter social regimentation &amp;ndash; what Weber and others called &amp;ldquo;the iron cage&amp;rdquo; of discipline &amp;ndash; to prevent heterodox alternatives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.stanford.edu/~avner/Greif_228_2005/Ekelund%2520et%2520al%25202002%2520JPE%2520Reformation.pdf%23:~:text%3Dthose%2520most%2520favorable%2520to%2520a,Tawney%2520%2528in%2520the&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805545404&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0KG7bRdCfvnybpK_mncFIc"&gt;web.stanford.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c7"&gt;Thus, liberal utopian energies were turned inward or bureaucratized. Public ecstatic prophecy gave way to private moral introspection. Where radicals preached overthrow of old orders, established Protestants preached obedience to magistrates (as a divine ordinance). Economic self-help replaced communal sharing (apart from groups like the Hutterites, who were also soon hunted). In short, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;utopian fervor was domesticated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;: Protestant regimes curbed &amp;ldquo;excess&amp;rdquo; liberty by binding believers into state churches and market roles &amp;ndash; a process very much in keeping with Foucault&amp;rsquo;s genealogy of modern discipline.&lt;/span&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;Sacramental Collapse: Demystifying the Cosmos&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;span class="c7"&gt;Central to Catholic Christianity was a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;sacramental worldview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;: God&amp;rsquo;s grace was mediated through visible rites and sacred objects. Transubstantiation, baptismal regeneration, confession, ordination, relics, and indulgences made the divine tangible. Protestantism, however, systematically &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;collapsed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;this sacramental universe into scripture and conscience. Catholic salvation was communal and mystical; Protestant salvation was individual and textual. As Weber observed, the Lutheran Reformation &amp;ldquo;completely eliminated salvation through Church and sacraments,&amp;rdquo; redefining faith as a personal relation with Christ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.stanford.edu/~avner/Greif_228_2005/Ekelund%2520et%2520al%25202002%2520JPE%2520Reformation.pdf%23:~:text%3Dhomoge%2502neous%2520event,absolutely%2520decisive%2520difference%2520from%2520Catholicism&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805547440&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3U3j8nn_Gjmr3HZ5QgYnLJ"&gt;web.stanford.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;What was lost or transformed? The Catholic cosmos &amp;ndash; a vertical ordering of Heaven, Earth, and the underworld &amp;ndash; was flattened. Purgatory vanished (Protestants abolished indulgences and the treasury of merit), so the uncertainty of souls after death was replaced by assurance of personal salvation or damnation. The Mass was no longer seen as a propitiatory sacrifice transcending time; it became a &amp;ldquo;supper&amp;rdquo; of remembrance. Calvin even likened the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper to the daily bread we eat &amp;ndash; a simple, earthly sign of Christ&amp;rsquo;s hidden presence. Some Protestants went further: Zwingli and the radical Anabaptists denied any real presence, treating Communion purely as a communal prayer. Thus &amp;ldquo;mystery&amp;rdquo; was deflated: nothing in the elements itself was magically efficacious, only faith made them meaningful.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c7"&gt;On the one hand, this might look like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;demystification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;. Protestant theology insisted on rational grounds: sacraments work when attended by true faith, not by any mystical power in the rite itself. Baptism, for example, was redefined as a sign of a covenant already bestowed by God, not as a merit-conferring act. In Protestant confessions, clergy are sharply demoted: there is no sacramental priesthood interposing between believer and God. Even Mary and the saints were largely excised from public worship (no more Corpus Christi or All Saints parades). What Foucault calls the &amp;ldquo;pastoral&amp;rdquo; function moved from confession to sermon and from the confessional stall to the bedroom: each believer&amp;rsquo;s conscience became the locus of spiritual accountability.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c7"&gt;On the other hand, Protestants redirected what had been &amp;ldquo;sacred power&amp;rdquo; into the Bible and the church as institution. With papal authority gone, scripture (and its interpretation by magisterial churches) became the ultimate arbiter of truth. One might say the church became its own miracle: words on a page, universally accessible, now held a quasi-cosmic primacy. Rather than relics or icons, Protestants prized the printed Word. Calvin&amp;rsquo;s Geneva even instituted a sort of &amp;ldquo;church discipline&amp;rdquo; with courts enforcing Sunday worship and Biblical ethics &amp;ndash; a new metaphysical order built on biblical time. In effect, sacraments were replaced by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;proclamation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. Saving grace did not cease to exist; it was reimagined as fully present in the Word made flesh, accessible to all believers in community. This reconfiguration signaled a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;redirection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;of spiritual power: from altars to pulpits, from ritual mystery to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;doctrinal certainty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c7"&gt;Talal Asad&amp;rsquo;s critique is instructive here: he argues that modern &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; is constructed as a system of belief separated from everyday life and politics. The Reformation laid the groundwork for this by tying salvation to assent to creedal propositions (e.g. justification by faith) rather than to participation in the medieval cultic order. In other words, Protestantism helped produce the idea that religion is essentially &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;belief and conscience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;, not ritual practice. The Catholic sacramental universe, in which the spiritual was deeply woven into the fabric of communal life, largely collapsed into a more privatized inner piety.&lt;/span&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;Myth, Belief, Organization, Ritual: A Comparative Framework&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;span class="c7"&gt;We may schematize the Reformation&amp;rsquo;s effect on the four dimensions of religion: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;myth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(sacred narrative), &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;belief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(doctrinal content), &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;organization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(institutional structure), and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;ritual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(symbolic practice).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul class="c14 lst-kix_3rqluxr8qhwv-0 start"&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;Myth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Catholicism was rich in mythic narrative: creation stories, the lives of saints, martyr legends, the cosmic drama of Christ&amp;rsquo;s death and sacrifice as &amp;ldquo;salvation history.&amp;rdquo; Protestants did not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;invent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;new myths, but they &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;recast or expelled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;the old ones. Biblical stories (e.g. the Exodus, Acts of the Apostles) were often read literally as &amp;ldquo;holy history&amp;rdquo; rather than allegory, but their interpretation became secularized (moral exemplars rather than mystical truths). Medieval myths like the intercession of saints, the cult of relics, or folk traditions (sprites, witches) were officially denounced as superstition. Nietzschean terms might say the Reformation &amp;ldquo;killed the Father&amp;rdquo; of myth, claiming progress required discarding the &amp;ldquo;spontaneous religion&amp;rdquo; of the people. Jean-Luc Nancy would note that this fits a monotheistic legacy: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;monotheism demythologizes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. As Nancy puts it, the Christian God &amp;ldquo;atheizes himself&amp;rdquo; by withdrawing from worldly story, ultimately signalling a world &amp;ldquo;without God&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://politicaltheology.com/jean-luc-nancy/%23:~:text%3DA%2520world%2520without%2520God%2520is,all%2520is%2520dethroned%2520but%2520capital&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805553001&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2NR-6cRWqUk4d1aMIIB223"&gt;politicaltheology.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;. Thus Protestantism pressed myth out of the church into individualized belief or history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;Belief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Belief (doctrine) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;rose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;in prominence. The Reformers championed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;sola scriptura&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Scripture alone) and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;sola fide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(faith alone) &amp;ndash; explicit propositional tenets about grace, election, and sacraments. Catechisms, confessions of faith, and theological debates proliferated. Intangible &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;belief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;became the litmus of religious identity. Each Protestant denomination codified its creed (Lutherans, Calvinists, Anglicans, etc.), so that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;organized belief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;now defined community. Ironically, this doctrinal focus was the new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;mythic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;core for believers: the myths had gone, but a rational narrative (from the Fall to the Last Judgment) took their place as a &amp;ldquo;cognitive frame.&amp;rdquo; Protestant preaching internalized biblical narrative into ethics (for example, Old Testament law became a moral story instead of a cosmic law imposed by a vicarious priesthood). The believer&amp;rsquo;s experience became &amp;ldquo;inner&amp;rdquo; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;belief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;-centered, satisfying Foucault&amp;rsquo;s notion of the confessional &amp;ndash; one now confessed faith and personal interpretation instead of penitent feeling. Rousseau and later secular thinkers would build on this, conceiving religion as &amp;ldquo;voluntary&amp;rdquo; creed anchored in conscience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;Organization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Institutionally, Protestantism fragmented the monolithic medieval Church into &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;many churches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. Each prince or city could set up its own church (often with a state-appointed bishop or consistory). The pre-Reformation Church&amp;rsquo;s universal hierarchy was replaced by national or local structures. In some cases (England, Scandinavia), monarchs became heads of church. In others (Geneva, some German cities), civic councils or synods ruled. Layered beneath these were further splits into sects and free churches (Anabaptists, Baptists, etc.) that often rejected state ties. Weber noted that Protestantism spawned a sect&amp;ndash;church cycle: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;sects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(voluntary, schismatic groups with strict disciplines) and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;churches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(state churches with formal membership) alternated, institutionalizing diversity. By contrast, medieval religion had been more geographically uniform, tied to local parishes but conceptually universal. In effect, Protestantism exported the logic of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;institutional organization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;&amp;nbsp;to the modern world: religion became one sphere of life with its own bureaucracies, comparable to the new secular state. This was a key step toward the modern category &amp;ldquo;organized religion&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; discrete societies governed by creeds and offices, distinct from (though often allied with) political power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;Ritual.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Protestant reformers drastically curtailed ritual. The medieval Mass, Marian devotions, fasts, pilgrimages, etc., were abolished or simplified. Only two sacraments remained (Baptism and the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Supper), and these were stripped of Catholic magic. Ordinary believers now needed only a Bible and prayer, rather than rosaries or candles. Eucharistic ritual became brief and vernacular, preceded by sermons. As noted above, liturgy shifted toward &amp;ldquo;clarity&amp;rdquo; and community, suppressing mystery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2017/10/11/protestantism-in-the-catholic-church-the-emergence-of-a-shared-tradition/%23:~:text%3Dthat%2520have%2520influenced%2520the%2520way,of%2520Christ%2520over%2520these%2520elements&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805557231&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3g94A1HfVKJK_WdOxapjXj"&gt;catholicworldreport.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. In sum, ritual and mythic performance &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;lost their former centrality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. Protestants did not &amp;ldquo;expel&amp;rdquo; myth entirely (they still told Bible stories and sang psalms), but they relocated much that was once symbol into &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;moral narrative and ethical life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;. Community solidarity relied more on schools, guilds, or nationhood than on religious fairs or processions. Sacramental grace, once a cosmic force, became an inner assurance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;Altogether, Protestantism can be seen as favoring &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;belief and organization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;over ritual and myth. It replaced a communal, embodied religion with a more disembodied, textually-grounded one. One might say it tried to secularize myth by making it historical (literal Bible accounts) or ethical (the world as stage for God&amp;rsquo;s moral teaching), rather than leaving it as immanent sacral saga. Nancy&amp;rsquo;s insight about capitalism is relevant: he contends that both monotheism and capitalism &amp;ldquo;strip&amp;rdquo; social life of narratives and values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://politicaltheology.com/jean-luc-nancy/%23:~:text%3DFollowing%2520Marx%252C%2520Nancy%2520understands%2520that%252C,the%2520value%2520of%2520capital%2520alone&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805559221&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2MP2Q3DoOmMylPXqXgHeH_"&gt;politicaltheology.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;. Protestantism&amp;rsquo;s rational morality and market-friendly individualism anticipated that process, leaving religion itself as one value-sphere (of belief) among others.&lt;/span&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;Long-Term Effects: Privatized Belief and the Making of Secular Religion&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;span class="c7"&gt;The structural shift initiated by Protestant reform &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;paved the way for the modern concept of religion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;as chiefly private belief. In the Protestant mold, religion became what one &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;believes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; doctrines on paper &amp;ndash; rather than what one &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;does&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;in ritual. This idea underlies our contemporary categories: &amp;ldquo;organized religion,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;belief system,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;secular faith.&amp;rdquo; As one recent scholar notes, the very notions of &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;secularity&amp;rdquo; in today&amp;rsquo;s liberal West are modeled on Enlightenment Protestant assumptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41682-023-00156-1%23:~:text%3DAs%2520I%25C2%25A0will%2520argue%2520in%2520the,both%2520religion%2520and%2520secularity%2520are&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805561276&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1PvZ6KNYSNdtzA1mhQ7UWx"&gt;link.springer.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. He writes: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;&amp;ldquo;When the modern concept of religion took shape, it was in the context of Enlightenment Protestantism, which became the model for religion as such.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41682-023-00156-1%23:~:text%3DAs%2520I%25C2%25A0will%2520argue%2520in%2520the,both%2520religion%2520and%2520secularity%2520are&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805561907&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0wpxQwxQrWlRl0BbkL6bn9"&gt;link.springer.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;. In other words, to be &amp;ldquo;religious&amp;rdquo; came to mean having interior convictions and private conscience &amp;ndash; exactly the Reformation&amp;rsquo;s emphasis.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;This shift had key implications:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul class="c14 lst-kix_flcpi6oo5tre-0 start"&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;Privatization of Belief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Protestant theology broke religion into personal faith. Each individual was encouraged to read the Bible and judge doctrine by conscience. The idea of a secular state could rest on the notion that religion is an optional, individual loyalty (as Jefferson and Madison later argued), not a corporate obligation. Indeed, the language of &amp;ldquo;religious liberty&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; freedom of opinion in matters of faith &amp;ndash; assumes religion is about inner assent. Talal Asad and others observe that modern human rights discourse redefines religion as &amp;ldquo;creedal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;deeply held belief.&amp;rdquo; This could hardly have emerged without Protestant influence; Catholics and Orthodox long defined religion in communal, sacramental terms (e.g. participation in the church, not mere belief).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;Separation of Church and State.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Confessional Europe in 1650 was still a world of established churches. But the Reformation&amp;rsquo;s legacy is a slow shift toward disestablishment. The wars of religion taught that enforcing uniform ritual breeds unrest; thinkers like Locke (a Puritan) argued for toleration precisely because faith was seen as inward. By the 19th century, many states claimed neutrality toward church beliefs, creating a public/private divide. This &amp;ldquo;secular&amp;rdquo; political order assumes religion is just one sector. It was imaginable because reformers had first relegated rites to the domestic sphere and invoked an autonomous conscience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;Organized Religion as Category.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;&amp;nbsp;The pluralism of Protestant sects itself established the norm of &amp;ldquo;organized religion&amp;rdquo; versus beliefs. Scholars of religion note that Protestant denominationalism provided the template for later religious identity groups everywhere. Even today, when sociologists study Buddhism or Islam, they often implicitly assume &amp;ldquo;believers&amp;rdquo; whose lives revolve around theology and moral commitments, a model inherited from Christianity. Nancy&amp;rsquo;s and Taylor&amp;rsquo;s work both remind us that our conceptual universe (religion, secularity, belief) emerged from a distinctly Western, Protestant-infused history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41682-023-00156-1%23:~:text%3DAs%2520I%25C2%25A0will%2520argue%2520in%2520the,both%2520religion%2520and%2520secularity%2520are&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805566779&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw05l_7MPEtsdhEIwu0MAC4Y"&gt;link.springer.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://politicaltheology.com/jean-luc-nancy/%23:~:text%3DA%2520world%2520without%2520God%2520is,all%2520is%2520dethroned%2520but%2520capital&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805567083&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0yW-u-aSq6CGOD3IrnImxr"&gt;politicaltheology.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;Secular Categories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Finally, Protestant reforms seeded secular ideas. By exiling myth and ritual from public life, Protestant culture helped carve out a separate realm for &amp;ldquo;the world.&amp;rdquo; Capital accumulation and statecraft (themselves fostered by Protestant ethics) became &amp;ldquo;secular&amp;rdquo; pursuits, distinct from &amp;ldquo;religious&amp;rdquo; redemption. Foucault&amp;rsquo;s notion of governmentality &amp;ndash; power over life &amp;ndash; finds an ironic foreshadowing in the Reformation: Luther&amp;rsquo;s teaching that princes govern God&amp;rsquo;s people, and Calvin&amp;rsquo;s theocratic city planning, were early forms of managing populations. The long-term result is a worldview where belief systems (like Christianity) coexist with other ideologies, none absolute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;In sum, the Protestant Reformation initiated a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;genealogy of modern religion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c7"&gt;. By substituting inward faith for outward magic, and doctrine for sacrament, it laid the groundwork for the very idea of religion as we know it today &amp;ndash; a private belief system organized into churches, separate from the secular state and stripped of the mythic depth that once animated medieval life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.stanford.edu/~avner/Greif_228_2005/Ekelund%2520et%2520al%25202002%2520JPE%2520Reformation.pdf%23:~:text%3Dhomoge%2502neous%2520event,absolutely%2520decisive%2520difference%2520from%2520Catholicism&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805569223&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3i2JEY4ljVYVvsFshF1N6u"&gt;web.stanford.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9 c17"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41682-023-00156-1%23:~:text%3DAs%2520I%25C2%25A0will%2520argue%2520in%2520the,both%2520religion%2520and%2520secularity%2520are&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805569463&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0hmarPVtWBOs3avA9HPM8O"&gt;link.springer.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c13 c7 c20"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Medieval Christianity had understood &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;fides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;as an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;embodied habitus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;mdash;a virtue formed by charity (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;fides formata caritate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) and enacted through sacrament and community.&amp;#8239;Aquinas: &amp;ldquo;faith is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;formed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;by charity; charity makes faith perfect.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;Early reformers reversed the vector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="c14 lst-kix_e5l8xxwnuuh3-0 start"&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;Martin&amp;#8239;Luther&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;called faith &amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;a living, daring confidence in God&amp;rsquo;s grace, so sure and certain that a man could stake his life on it a thousand times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c22 c20 c6"&gt;The &amp;ldquo;confidence&amp;rdquo; happens in the conscience; ritual can only preach or symbolize it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;John&amp;#8239;Calvin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;tightened the definition: &amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;Faith is a firm and certain knowledge of God&amp;rsquo;s favor toward us, founded upon the truth of the freely given promise in Christ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In both cases, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;knowledge&amp;#8209;of&amp;#8209;grace displaces participation&amp;#8209;in&amp;#8209;grace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Where Aquinas located faith in a sacramental ecology, Luther and Calvin locate it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;inside the judging subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;mdash;a decisive step toward the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;buffered self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;that Charles&amp;#8239;Taylor sees as the hallmark of secularity .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="c0 c10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

==== &lt;span class="c13 c7 c8"&gt;2&amp;#8239;&amp;#8239;Sola&amp;#8239;fide and the birth of Protestant anxiety&lt;/span&gt; ====
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because salvation now rests on an invisible disposition, believers had to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;audit their own interior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Luther&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;Anfechtung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;(assaults of doubt) captures the mood: the Word &amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;teaches you &amp;hellip; to experience how right, how true, how sweet &amp;hellip; God&amp;rsquo;s Word is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;rdquo; only through struggle and anxiety .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the 17th&amp;#8239;c. Puritans were urged to keep &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;spiritual &amp;ldquo;registers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;mdash;journals in which daily feelings were interrogated for evidence of grace:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0 c26"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;ldquo;Self&amp;#8209;examination is the setting up a court in conscience and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;keeping a register there&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;, that by strict scrutiny a man may know how things stand between God and his own soul.&amp;rdquo; (Thomas&amp;#8239;Watson)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The result, as historian Stannard notes, was an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;&amp;ldquo;intense and unremitting fear of death&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;produced by God&amp;rsquo;s inscrutable choice .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="c0 c10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

==== &lt;span class="c13 c7 c8"&gt;3&amp;#8239;&amp;#8239;Predestination and the double bind&lt;/span&gt; ====
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Calvinist predestination &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;intensified the loop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: inward assurance is both &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;sign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;of election and something no act of will can secure. Diaries, sermons, and tracts therefore teach believers to read every tremor of the heart as possible evidence&amp;mdash;while warning that self&amp;#8209;deception is omnipresent. John&amp;#8239;Bunyan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;Grace Abounding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;swings between terror and relief, memorializing each doubt so that it can serve as later proof of deliverance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Calvinist must therefore &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;believe sincerely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;perform belief strategically&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;mdash;a proto&amp;#8209;modern &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;doublethink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;in which the self polices itself for the right affect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="c0 c10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

==== &lt;span class="c13 c7 c8"&gt;4&amp;#8239;&amp;#8239;From confessional interior to self&amp;#8209;surveillance&lt;/span&gt; ====
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;Michel&amp;#8239;Foucault supplies the genealogy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="c14 lst-kix_4zm5unro13x-0 start"&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;He who is subjected to a field of visibility &amp;hellip; inscribes in himself the power relation &amp;hellip; he becomes the principle of his own subjection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Protestant sermon replaces the Catholic confessional booth; but the logic is identical: the believer internalizes the gaze and turns it on the self &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;continuously&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Louis&amp;#8239;Althusser&amp;rsquo;s axiom&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;there is no ideology except by the subject and for the subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;describes precisely this transition: faith becomes an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;ideological interpellation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;that calls &amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;You!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;rdquo; and is answered in an inward voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="c0 c10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

==== &lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;5&amp;#8239;&amp;#8239;Catholic &amp;amp; Orthodox alternatives: faith as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1 c28 c8"&gt;communion&lt;/span&gt; ====
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Catholic theology keeps faith entwined with sacrament: it is perfected by charity (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;habitus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;) and enacted corporeally in Eucharist, pilgrimage, penance. Eastern Orthodoxy radicalizes this relational ontology.&amp;#8239;John&amp;#8239;Zizioulas:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0 c26"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;All communion must involve otherness as a primary and constitutive ingredient &amp;hellip; freedom is part of the notion of being.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;faith = shared liturgy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;, not private certitude. The ecclesial body, not the introspective conscience, mediates salvation&amp;mdash;short&amp;#8209;circuiting the solitary anxiety that haunted Protestants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="c0 c10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Its legacy runs from Puritan diaries to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;modern &amp;ldquo;entrepreneur of the self.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Understanding this arc is crucial for any critique of contemporary religiosity (including neo&amp;#8209;pagan revivals): the field in which new myths are planted has already been ploughed by Protestant interiorization, anxiety, and the ideological demand to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;mean what we perform while performing what we must mean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span class="c20 c6 c22"&gt;(For fuller development see Weber 1905; Foucault 1979; Taylor 2007; Asad 1993; Cavanaugh 2008.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0 c10"&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;Evangelicalism as Late&amp;#8209;Capitalist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8 c6"&gt;Reterritorialization&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c22 c20 c6"&gt;(A Marxist&amp;ndash;Deleuzian reading of how U&amp;#8239;S&amp;#8209;style evangelicalism stabilizes the neoliberal order while masking its own contradictions)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

==== &lt;span class="c7 c8"&gt;10&amp;#8239;&amp;#8239;Conclusion: evangelicalism as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1 c8 c28"&gt;reterritorialization of decoded flows&lt;/span&gt; ====
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Evangelicalism stabilizes late&amp;#8209;capitalist crisis by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;simplifying belief, aesthetic, and social order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;to the bare minimum required for continued extraction. Its megachurch soundscape and purity rules are not nostalgic returns to tradition; they are the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;cheap plastic scaffolding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;erected after decades of neoliberal demolition. Yet counter&amp;#8209;flows&amp;mdash;from Black liberationist preaching to Anatolian businessmen re&amp;#8209;imagining Islamic piety&amp;mdash;show that decoded desire can still exceed the axioms. As Deleuze &amp;amp;&amp;#8239;Guattari warn, the very flows that capitalism unleashes may ultimately &amp;ldquo;destroy the socius&amp;rdquo; it tries to save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reddit.com/r/Deleuze/comments/1in80s0/what_do_you_make_of_the_famous_accelerate_the/?utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805603994&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2gbijbg56qA0d0kPszXBhp"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reddit.com/r/Deleuze/comments/1in80s0/what_do_you_make_of_the_famous_accelerate_the/?utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805604174&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0Tk22S_KagaMV1GWu0n36n"&gt;Reddit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;. Whether evangelicalism mutates again or collapses under its own contradictions will shape the spiritual terrain in which new (neo&amp;#8209;pagan?) imaginaries must operate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c5"&gt;Evangelicalism and the Neoliberal Order&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Contemporary U.S. evangelicalism operates largely as a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;simplified faith culture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;shaped for mass consumption. Services resemble entertainment events &amp;ndash; with stadium&amp;#8208;style praise bands, multimedia lighting, and rapid-fire sermons &amp;ndash; rather than centers of rigorous theology. Even sympathetic observers admit the shallowness of much evangelical content. As pastor Tim Challies criticizes, many churches &amp;ldquo;use clich&amp;eacute;d words to worship a clich&amp;eacute;d God&amp;rdquo; so that congregants experience nothing deeper than sentimentality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.challies.com/articles/the-shallowness-of-evangelicalism/%23:~:text%3DI%25E2%2580%2599m%2520sure%2520I%2520could%2520go,minds%2520and%2520to%2520our%2520hearts&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805605500&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2_8A27g0FUblltMhzo7KtO"&gt;challies.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This aestheticized worship discourages critical thought: emotional resonance and personal &amp;ldquo;encounters with God&amp;rdquo; replace extended biblical exposition or dialectical teaching. In effect, worship becomes a vehicle for ideological conformity. By offering distraction and an upbeat narrative of personal success, the format deters believers from questioning the social order. In Marxist terms, religion is a narcotic for the masses &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;the opium of the people&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; consoling them under capitalist exploitation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.marquette.edu/facultyblog/2015/01/karl-marx-on-religion/comment-page-1/%23:~:text%3DMarx%25E2%2580%2599s%2520actual%2520words%2520regarding%2520religion,%25E2%2580%259D&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805606248&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw10TYs3qKefbXdDd0-rzB9T"&gt;law.marquette.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;. Contemporary evangelicalism exemplifies this, favoring simple uplifting messages over intellectual depth, thus channeling anxieties away from systemic critique into private piety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;Patriarchy and the Neoliberal Family&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Evangelicalism continues to enforce strict &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;gender hierarchies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, buttressing the myth of the self-sufficient nuclear family even as its material basis erodes. Modern churches almost universally preach &amp;ldquo;biblical manhood&amp;rdquo; and female submission, reviving the patriarchal family of the 1950s. But with men&amp;rsquo;s wages stagnant and dual-income households now the norm, this model is largely symbolic. Popular critics note that &amp;ldquo;complementarianism is patriarchy&amp;#8239;&amp;ndash; nothing more, nothing less,&amp;rdquo; despite evangelical claims to mutual &amp;ldquo;complementarity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rachelheldevans.com/blog/complementarians-patriarchy%23:~:text%3DComplemenarianism%2520is%2520patriarchy%25E2%2580%2594nothing%2520more%252C%2520nothing,crystal%2520clear%2520when%2520John%2520Piper&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805607350&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3mvgWhDPSnnbF8bsS8AL5c"&gt;rachelheldevans.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In practice, women are often pressured into traditional roles and men into authoritarian &amp;ldquo;head of household&amp;rdquo; roles, even though economic reality forces both to work. This ideological insistence on male dominion (as &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo;s design&amp;rsquo;) and female deference stabilizes the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;neoliberal family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;ideal: the burden of care and responsibility falls on the private family so that the state may retreat. Maintaining these gender norms gives individuals a sense of order and purpose amid economic precarity. In sum, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;family values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;promoted by evangelicals function as an ideological safeguard: they re-inscribe patriarchal authority on the cultural level precisely when genuine patriarchy (the breadwinning father) has been hollowed out by capitalism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;Emotion and the Decline of Doctrine: Evangelism as Late-Stage Domination&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In late-stage capitalism, evangelicalism has shifted from intellectual substance to affective spectacle &amp;ndash; a transformation one can view through Deleuze&amp;rsquo;s notion of &amp;ldquo;pure control.&amp;rdquo; The old &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;coded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;doctrines (e.g. Calvinist theology) are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;decoded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;away, leaving a raw flow of feeling and belief that can be modulate by church producers. Churches now operate like entrepreneurial enterprises: pastors market the faith, worship is carefully stage-managed, and success is measured by crowd size and social-media buzz. David Wells, a theologian, notes how market logic has invaded worship: &amp;ldquo;We have brought into the church the rhythms of buying and selling, of making a product appealing so that a potential buyer can be lured into a sale,&amp;rdquo; and we turn &amp;ldquo;the atmosphere of worship into one of pleasant entertainment&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://learn.ligonier.org/articles/soul-shaping-reality-gospel-interview-david-wells%23:~:text%3DDW%253A%2520We%2520have%2520brought%2520into,takes%252C%2520no%2520matter%2520how%2520inappropriate&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805609386&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2u5omS2uS5uAzNedCNVx78"&gt;learn.ligonier.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The gospel becomes a spiritual product packaged as feel-good therapy. For Deleuze, this is a hallmark of capitalist &amp;ldquo;societies of control&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; people are not controlled by overt discipline but by modulating their desires and affects. Evangelical services, with their upbeat music and positive-affirmation slogans, exemplify this mode. Content-light preaching (e.g. prosperity promises or simplistic moral lists) substitutes for dense theology. Believers are thus subtly governed by emotion: they are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;led to love their situation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;in exchange for community and hope, rather than confronted with material injustice. This embodies a late-stage ideological domination, where control is exercised not by heavy-handed doctrine but by constant stimulation and distraction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;Homophobia, Transphobia, and the Politics of Identity&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sexual and gender issues serve as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;cultural battlefields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;that &amp;ldquo;make the base&amp;rdquo; for evangelical political identity. With capitalist crisis undermining stable class identities, evangelicals increasingly fixate on policing sexuality as a source of order. Historian Randall Balmer explains that the Religious Right learned any issue tied to sexual morality would reliably mobilize its members: &amp;ldquo;any issue that had some sort of connection to sexuality or sexual behavior was going to work for them&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/why-is-the-gop-escalating-attacks-on-trans-rights-experts-say-the-goal-is-to-make-sure-evangelicals-vote%23:~:text%3D%25E2%2580%259CAs%2520they%2520were%2520searching%2520for,them%252C%25E2%2580%259D%2520Balmer%2520told%2520The%252019th&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805611064&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0wx26W1MgVOMODcfyS-LVz"&gt;pbs.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Evangelical leaders cycle through crusades against &amp;ldquo;sodomy,&amp;rdquo; gay marriage, abortion, and now transgender rights, not simply out of doctrinal purity but to produce a cohesive &amp;ldquo;us vs. them&amp;rdquo; narrative. This culture war dynamic resonates with Marxist and Foucauldian ideas of scapegoating: as economic and social institutions destabilize, marginalized groups become convenient targets. One social theorist notes that in capitalist crises homophobia and transphobia are &amp;ldquo;weaponized to police populations around access to diminishing spoils or social surpluses&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://jacobin.com/2023/06/capitalism-homophobia-history-christopher-chitty-sexual-hegemony%23:~:text%3DIn%2520those%2520contexts%252C%2520sodomy%2520accusations,uses%2520some%2520broad%2520histories%2520and&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805611853&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0-KHuaRmBrm1XnSVeVXojg"&gt;jacobin.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;. In practice, enraging the faithful over &amp;ldquo;gender chaos&amp;rdquo; helps maintain an illusion of cosmic order: rigid male/female roles are presented as God&amp;rsquo;s unshakeable design against a world of fluid identities. In the wake of Roe v. Wade&amp;rsquo;s repeal, this trend accelerated: evangelicals, having won on abortion, have redoubled their campaign on LGBT issues to channel discontent. The preached threat of &amp;ldquo;men in women&amp;rsquo;s bathrooms&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;groomers&amp;rdquo; functions to discipline congregants&amp;rsquo; anxieties and reinforce the old gender code, even as the real material basis for that code continues to vanish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;From Reformation to Megachurch: A Distorted Inheritance&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Modern evangelicalism would be unrecognizable to Luther or Calvin. The Reformers built denominations around doctrine, biblical exegesis, and a communal intellectual tradition. By contrast, today&amp;rsquo;s megachurches emphasize &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;inward experience over theological rigor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, though they still demand inner belief. The only lasting legacy of Protestantism is the premium on personal faith (&amp;ldquo;believe and be saved&amp;rdquo;), yet this has been transmuted into a consumerized spirituality. David Wells argues that instead of confronting sin and society, the American church has largely become a &amp;ldquo;marketing strategy&amp;rdquo; for self-help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://learn.ligonier.org/articles/soul-shaping-reality-gospel-interview-david-wells%23:~:text%3Dbad%2521%2520What%2520it%2520requires%2520is,before%2520our%2520great%2520God%2520and&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805613505&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1cJP14YGwJWjjroYQjYlLo"&gt;learn.ligonier.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. He insists that the true gospel &amp;ldquo;is not about self-therapy&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;a soul-shaking, costly, demanding reality&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://learn.ligonier.org/articles/soul-shaping-reality-gospel-interview-david-wells%23:~:text%3Dbad%2521%2520What%2520it%2520requires%2520is,before%2520our%2520great%2520God%2520and&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805613822&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2FN6hQOwx3PxCZk5udHl18"&gt;learn.ligonier.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a witness scarcely found in much of today&amp;rsquo;s ministry. Where Lutherans and Calvinists would debate the Eucharist or predestination, many evangelicals now simply feel goosebumps when the lights dim, then move on to the next upbeat song. In short, the complex Protestant intellectual heritage has been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;decoded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;into something like a feel-good club, re-territorialized on hope and belonging. Structurally, however, evangelicals still demand loyalty to faith (echoing &amp;ldquo;faith alone&amp;rdquo;); there remains an insistence on an inner conversion experience. But even that inwardness is thin: it is inwardness as personal success story, not inwardness as humble submission to a transcendent truth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;Transnational Networks and Anti-Communist Roots&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The U.S. evangelical core is the hub of a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;global religious&amp;#8208;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;network united by shared ideology and anti-communist history. Even ostensibly non-evangelical groups like Japan&amp;rsquo;s Unification Church have paralleled this agenda. In fact, Moon&amp;rsquo;s Unification movement &amp;ldquo;set up media companies, research centers, and educational institutions that focused on anti-communist ideologies&amp;rdquo; in the 1950s&amp;ndash;80s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_Church_and_politics%23:~:text%3DIn%2520the%25201950s%2520and%252080s%252C,52%2520in%2520Japan%252C%2520leading%2520to&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805615306&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw12DH-yYPw9y3tVsgFkcUUR"&gt;en.wikipedia.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;. Such groups forged ties with American conservatives (e.g. through the National Prayer Breakfast, founded by Abraham Vereide in 1953 as a Christian anti-Communist fellowship). Likewise, hardline Catholic organizations (Opus Dei and others) work alongside evangelicals in crusades against socialism, abortion, and secularism. These transnational alliances trace back to the Cold War: the Religious Right grew out of a &amp;ldquo;spiritual-industrial complex&amp;rdquo; aimed at defeating Marxism, using the rhetoric of a holy war to unite business leaders, pastors, and politicians. In practice, this means international conferences and family-value coalitions that blur denominational lines. The National Prayer Breakfast &amp;ndash; an annual meeting of politicians, preachers, and foreign dignitaries &amp;ndash; exemplifies this network in action. Across borders, evangelicals, Moonies, conservative Catholics, and right-wing Christians share resources and messaging, reinforcing each other&amp;rsquo;s power. In each context, appeals to anti-communism and fear of &amp;ldquo;moral decay&amp;rdquo; form the backbone of an ideology that ultimately justifies the capitalist status quo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;Global Parallels: Emerging Patterns in Other Traditions&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;While our focus is U.S. evangelicalism, similar religion-capital alliances are seen elsewhere. For example, Turkey under Erdo&amp;#287;an has promoted a state-centric Sunni Islam that validates neoliberal economics and patriarchal social policies. The government encourages &amp;ldquo;faith-based&amp;rdquo; charity and conservative education that push a family-centered vision mirroring America&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;family values,&amp;rdquo; even as it embraces global capitalism. Scholars observe that many Islamic organizations in Turkey now function as instruments of neoliberal governmentality, disciplining women into traditional roles while integrating markets into daily life. In short, an &amp;ldquo;Islamic neoliberalism&amp;rdquo; is emerging: it shares with evangelicalism an emphasis on personal piety over social justice, and on reproducing existing hierarchies via moral authority. This is distinct from older &amp;ldquo;overcoded&amp;rdquo; forms like Wahhabi fundamentalism or state secularism; rather, it adapts religion to the demands of market society. Similar convergences can be seen in Hindu nationalism and other faith movements worldwide, where religion is recast to legitimate existing power structures while providing spiritual consolation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;Ideology and Affect: Theoretical Perspectives&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Drawing it all together, we can interpret evangelical capitalism with classic critical theories. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;Althusser&amp;rsquo;s interpellation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;is strikingly on point: Christian ideology &amp;ldquo;addresses a human individual called Peter&amp;hellip; in order to tell you that God exists and that you are answerable to Him,&amp;rdquo; ultimately declaring &amp;ldquo;This is your place in the world! This is what you must do!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/religion-bites/louis-althusser-on-ideology-state-apparatus-ideology-interpellation-5a8b3df554d0%23:~:text%3DIt%2520says%253A%2520I%2520address%2520myself,means%252C%2520if%2520you%2520observe%2520the&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805618610&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw00hLfjADR3DZ0HQUnnfU1-"&gt;medium.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In practice, sermons name congregants (even by name) and designate their roles (husband, wife, citizen), and believers respond, &amp;ldquo;Yes, this is me.&amp;rdquo; This ritual hailing ensures each person recognizes the evangelical life-script as their destiny. Althusser notes that such interpellation presupposes a single &amp;ldquo;Absolute Other&amp;rdquo; (God) whose authority grounds the whole system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/religion-bites/louis-althusser-on-ideology-state-apparatus-ideology-interpellation-5a8b3df554d0%23:~:text%3DIt%2520then%2520emerges%2520that%2520the,what%2520is%2520rightly%2520called%2520the&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805619240&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw30e4lInosepemBJP1_N9f8"&gt;medium.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Foucault&amp;rsquo;s terms, the evangelical church is a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;pastoral power&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;that produces self-disciplined subjects. From childhood Sunday school through voluntary adult Bible classes, believers learn to monitor their own conduct (sexual, financial, personal) by internalizing evangelical norms. Confession and accountability groups further instill this self-governance. In effect, the church trains &amp;ldquo;docile bodies&amp;rdquo; aligned to capitalist society: believers police themselves to be productive, faithful citizens and parents. There is no need for external force; spirituality itself instils the desired behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walter Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s insights on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;aestheticized politics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;also resonate. Benjamin argued that fascism turns politics into mass spectacle (&amp;ldquo;the logical outcome of fascism is an aestheticization of political life&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/benjamins-warning%23:~:text%3D%25E2%2580%259CThe%2520logical%2520outcome%2520of%2520fascism,without%2520effect%252C%2520you%2520get%2520aesthetics&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805620621&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3rz5BMXdsDlVWvIX3cyQhV"&gt;commonwealmagazine.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Similarly, evangelicalism often merges religion and politics into an emotional pageant. Mega-rallies, patriotically charged sermons, and prayer rallies treat political-economic orders as moral crusades. By politicizing religion in aesthetic form (flags at church, rhetoric of &amp;ldquo;righteous nation,&amp;rdquo; culture-war marches), the movement channels dissent into spectacle rather than organized challenge. The effect is the same Benjamin described: people demand expression (e.g. a prayer rally) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;without effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;on real power structures. Thus the evangelical Right&amp;rsquo;s media-savvy events serve the status quo by satisfying the longing for change with gut-level theatrics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, Lewis Mumford&amp;rsquo;s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;megamachine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;concept highlights the technological-totalitarian dimension. Mumford called modern tech-capitalism &amp;ldquo;the ultimate religion of our seemingly rational age,&amp;rdquo; in which &amp;ldquo;the meaning of life was reduced to accelerating movement and change&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;bigger and bigger&amp;hellip; faster and faster became ends in themselves&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2024/06/14/the-ultimate-religion-of-our-seemingly-rational-age-revisiting-mumfords-megamachine/%23:~:text%3DIn%2520commenting%2520on%2520%25E2%2580%259Cthe%2520myth,godlike%2520power%25E2%2580%259D%2520and%2520all%2520of&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805622047&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0qwUt1kLO-rPR1aX57ghZr"&gt;librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;. Evangelicalism today inhabits that megatechnical environment. Digital streaming, social media algorithms, and consumer culture form a grand infrastructure that enfolds every church. Technology is worshipped alongside God (smartphones, megachurch sound systems, online influence). Evangelical media networks (TV preachers, podcasts, conference tours) are nodes of this megamachine. Believers are offered a steady stream of images and narratives of faith as remedy &amp;ndash; a &amp;ldquo;mass-produced plentitude&amp;rdquo; as Mumford describes &amp;ndash; which distracts from capitalism&amp;rsquo;s harms. In short, the church is not separate from the megatechnical system but part of its priesthood. Evangelicalism&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on individual salvation and trust in a &amp;ldquo;higher plan&amp;rdquo; functions in the same way Mumford saw blind faith in science and progress: it sustains the myth that the system can be redeemed (by God or technology) even as it grinds people under.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="c14 lst-kix_973607v9i7pw-0 start"&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;Marxism (ideology/opium)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Religion is ideology that maintains class power.

It interpellates believers into predefined roles (patriarch/provider, submissive wife, obedient child, God-fearing worker) and disciplines them with promise of afterlife as the ultimate payout. Its religious aesthetics mirror those of consumer capitalism: flashy, immediate, emotionally satisfying, yet substantively empty. Through these means, U.S. evangelicalism promotes the capitalist status quo and legitimizes exploitation under a veneer of piety &amp;ndash; an alliance of religion, desire, and power that only intensifies as late-stage capitalism advances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;Sources:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Analysis above draws on contemporary and classical sources of political theology and critical theory, including evangelical commentators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.challies.com/articles/the-shallowness-of-evangelicalism/%23:~:text%3DI%25E2%2580%2599m%2520sure%2520I%2520could%2520go,minds%2520and%2520to%2520our%2520hearts&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805626732&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0XIYZlG1DMUex8H0D80OMr"&gt;challies.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://learn.ligonier.org/articles/soul-shaping-reality-gospel-interview-david-wells%23:~:text%3DDW%253A%2520We%2520have%2520brought%2520into,takes%252C%2520no%2520matter%2520how%2520inappropriate&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805626909&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2LTFFlwpoPgi-sEoNm17h7"&gt;learn.ligonier.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;and left critiques&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://jacobin.com/2023/06/capitalism-homophobia-history-christopher-chitty-sexual-hegemony%23:~:text%3DIn%2520those%2520contexts%252C%2520sodomy%2520accusations,uses%2520some%2520broad%2520histories%2520and&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805627138&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw058hGm_dU-lRxqv4AnK3fX"&gt;jacobin.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2024/06/14/the-ultimate-religion-of-our-seemingly-rational-age-revisiting-mumfords-megamachine/%23:~:text%3DIn%2520commenting%2520on%2520%25E2%2580%259Cthe%2520myth,godlike%2520power%25E2%2580%259D%2520and%2520all%2520of&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805627351&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1Bw6liJyUxR6K7ZtMG0C3E"&gt;librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, integrated with theoretical insights from Althusser, Foucault, Benjamin, and Mumford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/religion-bites/louis-althusser-on-ideology-state-apparatus-ideology-interpellation-5a8b3df554d0%23:~:text%3DIt%2520says%253A%2520I%2520address%2520myself,means%252C%2520if%2520you%2520observe%2520the&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805627621&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw33XaRTWUJAsbE5od4Hgl6m"&gt;medium.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/benjamins-warning%23:~:text%3D%25E2%2580%259CThe%2520logical%2520outcome%2520of%2520fascism,without%2520effect%252C%2520you%2520get%2520aesthetics&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805627779&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0sVf81ZTe1cOhsTUFpOn92"&gt;commonwealmagazine.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2024/06/14/the-ultimate-religion-of-our-seemingly-rational-age-revisiting-mumfords-megamachine/%23:~:text%3DIn%2520commenting%2520on%2520%25E2%2580%259Cthe%2520myth,godlike%2520power%25E2%2580%259D%2520and%2520all%2520of&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805627982&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3JPoIi18qPENKbtndGI5JH"&gt;librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;.

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;1 Introduction: The Strange Career of the Latter&amp;#8209;day Saints&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nineteenth&amp;#8209;century Mormonism erupted out of the Protestant &amp;ldquo;burned&amp;#8209;over district&amp;rdquo; yet immediately &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;rejected the disenchanted cosmos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;that mainline revivalism had normalized. &amp;nbsp;Joseph Smith&amp;rsquo;s revelations insisted that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;matter is eternal, that gods progress, and that humanity may join their ranks. This audacious cosmology fuelled experiments in consecrated property, plural marriage, and theocratic settlement&amp;mdash;practices that, at their inception, looked more like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;utopian socialism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;than the bourgeois respectability later associated with Utah. Whereas Marx denounced religion as ideology, early Latter&amp;#8209;day Saints weaponised myth to build a counter&amp;#8209;economy; they tried to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;reterritorialise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;the capitalist frontier on communal lines even as they borrowed its techniques of movement and expansion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;We read Mormonism here through four lenses:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="c14 lst-kix_25a4ywbr123e-0 start"&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;Marx &amp;amp; primitive accumulation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Mormon consecration fought enclosure with a covenantal commons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;Deleuze &amp;amp; Guattari&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;re&amp;#8209;enchantment machine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Smith decoded Protestantism only to replug believers into an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;infinitely expandable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;cosmos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;Walter Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s dialectical image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the Nauvoo temple as a revolutionary montage of Israelite, Masonic, and American symbols.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;Lewis Mumford&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;megamachine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Brigham Young&amp;rsquo;s territorial kingdom anticipates the technocratic state yet briefly subordinates it to agrarian cooperation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="c2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Smith&amp;rsquo;s May 1843 discourse declared that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;&amp;ldquo;spirit is a refined matter&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;and that intelligence &amp;ldquo;cannot be created or made&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/discourse-17-may-1843-b?utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805631838&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3phmtxYM_HMLfHFjw43jIS"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/discourse-17-may-1843-b?utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805632075&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1v8Kg8h3IE3FEWURlNnmzh"&gt;josephsmithpapers.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Matter itself is divine; the world is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;enchanted down to its atoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Snow&amp;rsquo;s famous couplet turns this into eschatology: humans may ascend the same ontological ladder God once climbed. Where classical Christianity saw an unbridgeable Creator&amp;#8209;creature gap, Mormonism installs a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;cosmic proletariat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;: every being can rise by cooperative labor&amp;mdash;temple work, covenant, and family sealing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

==== &lt;span class="c13 c7 c8"&gt;2.2 The Adam&amp;#8209;God Doctrine as Radical Genealogy&lt;/span&gt; ====
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brigham Young&amp;rsquo;s sermons went further: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Adam is our Father and God&amp;hellip; the God of the earth&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mormonthink.com/QUOTES/adamgod.htm?utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805632974&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw095ZGCRYqJC85-yY1_YeB1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mormonthink.com/QUOTES/adamgod.htm?utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805633112&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2tgYDo6j3bKvJ68b9nRCh6"&gt;mormonthink.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Scholars debate the doctrine&amp;rsquo;s orthodoxy, but politically it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;relocated sovereignty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;from a distant omnipotence to the first embodied patriarch. In Deleuzian terms, Young folds divinity back into the plane of immanence, short&amp;#8209;circuiting the transcendent despotic signifier. God becomes an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;ancestor&amp;#8209;king&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;whose authority is genealogical rather than absolutist&amp;mdash;a move that both empowers communal kin&amp;#8209;structures and risks reinforcing patriarchal domination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="c2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;From Kirtland (1830s) to Brigham City (1870s) the church organised &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;United Orders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;mdash;civic&amp;#8209;economic co&amp;#8209;ops where families deeded land to a common fund and received stewardships in return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/united-orders?lang%3Deng%26utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805635318&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3B-IjsmhiX9-wREPM5mOB1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/united-orders?lang%3Deng%26utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805635494&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1ohHl7D6Yl_yEPafUdIHzs"&gt;churchofjesuschrist.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;.

Yet the Orders collapsed under federal pressure, internal inequality, and Utah&amp;rsquo;s integration into transcontinental markets&amp;mdash;illustrating Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s insight that every revolutionary &amp;ldquo;image&amp;rdquo; is shot through with its counter&amp;#8209;image of defeat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="c2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;4 Contradictions: Polygyny, Patriarchy, and the Color Line&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radical cosmology coexisted with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;radical patriarchy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Plural marriage concentrated authority in male priesthood; the Adam&amp;#8209;God myth literalised male divinity. Simultaneously, Brigham Young codified a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;priesthood/racial ban&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1852&amp;ndash;1978) that excluded Black saints from temple rites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people_and_temple_and_priesthood_policies_in_the_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints?utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805637108&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw19SJKDbA_mTxOoLgQtWXQZ"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people_and_temple_and_priesthood_policies_in_the_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints?utm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805637302&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3GSZjSc1kqIZi9oEkE2km5"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;.

Like Mormonism, State&amp;#8239;Shinto used genealogy (sun&amp;#8209;descended Tenn&amp;#333;) and temple ritual to sacralise settlement (Hokkaid&amp;#333;) and communal labour. Both projects fused &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;myth with colonisation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;, but where State Shinto enforced hierarchy, early Mormonism preached lay theosis and voluntary consecration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Mormon temple liturgy&amp;mdash;with its Masonic dramas and covenantal oaths&amp;mdash;already performed a similar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;myth&amp;#8209;engineering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but in a theistic register. Both movements reveal how modern projects &amp;mdash;imperial, socialist, or sectarian&amp;mdash;turn to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;new theurgies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;when Enlightenment rationality proves cold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="c2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c19 c8"&gt;6 From Kingdom of God to Corporation of the President&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Railroads, federal anti&amp;#8209;polygamy campaigns, and the 1890 Manifesto forced Utah&amp;rsquo;s integration. By the mid&amp;#8209;20th century the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter&amp;#8209;day Saints had become one of America&amp;rsquo;s wealthiest corporations, investing in media, insurance, and global real estate. The communal Orders were replaced by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;tithing and for&amp;#8209;profit subsidiaries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;; polygamy was renounced; racial bans persisted until 1978. Mumford&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;megamachine&amp;rdquo; triumphs: the church now operates data centers and maintains an online genealogy empire&amp;mdash;redeeming the dead with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;cloud computing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;rather than agrarian commons. Cosmic optimism survives, but the cooperative economy has been thoroughly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;reterritorialised by finance capital&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="c2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c13 c8 c19"&gt;7 Conclusion: A Dialectical Legacy&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Early Mormonism dramatises a recurring theme in this book: attempts to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;re&amp;#8209;enchant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;re&amp;#8209;common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;the world under capitalist pressure. Smith&amp;rsquo;s material cosmology and the United Orders were genuine gestures toward what Benjamin called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;&amp;ldquo;the weak messianic power&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the oppressed. Yet patriarchal and racial exclusions, plus the irresistible pull of westward markets, foreclosed the most radical possibilities. Today, LDS humanitarianism and missionary networks mirror neoliberal NGO logic, while temple theology still whispers the old promise of godhood. Mormonism thus stands as a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;dialectical image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;mdash;at once a frontier socialism and a template for corporate religion&amp;mdash;offering both caution and inspiration to contemporary movements seeking to reclaim myth and economics from the dead hand of capital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="c2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Inspired by millennial egalitarianism, they set up cooperative businesses, shared livestock and tools, and even started the Kirtland Safety Society bank as a communal credit venture. Later, under Brigham Young in Utah, dozens of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;United Order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;settlements were launched: local wards deeded property to the bishop and held &amp;ldquo;stewardships,&amp;rdquo; returning surplus production to a communal storehouse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Order%23:~:text%3DThe%2520United%2520Order%2520established%2520egalitarian,which&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805651892&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3zdSdHBRrizP5aBVhaBzVp"&gt;en.wikipedia.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

The United Orders and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;Zion projects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;resembled other utopian socialist experiments (e.g. Owenite or Shaker communities), challenging &amp;ldquo;fundamental ideals&amp;rdquo; of American society &amp;ndash; private property, republican politics, capitalist competition, and monogamous family norms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.timesandseasons.org/2009/02/mormonism-and-communal-studies/%23:~:text%3Dthroughout%2520American%2520history%252C%2520these%2520groups,the%2520American%2520reaction%2520to%2520Mormonism&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805653728&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2c4I-2G0aPcAl7J5PV0TTE"&gt;archive.timesandseasons.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.timesandseasons.org/2009/02/mormonism-and-communal-studies/%23:~:text%3DNineteenth,family%2520by%2520embracing%2520plural%2520marriage&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805653935&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0ENcE1_IjNpXXaKQgYIDFl"&gt;archive.timesandseasons.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

In Marx&amp;rsquo;s terms, the early Mormon &amp;ldquo;base&amp;rdquo; (property relations) shifted back into the capitalist superstructure, and religion now began to reinforce rather than challenge the existing order.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c5"&gt;Theocratic Kingdom and Mythic History&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Parallel to economic communalism was an ambitious &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;theocratic vision&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Joseph Smith conceived a future &amp;ldquo;Kingdom of God&amp;rdquo; on earth, blending civil and sacred authority. In 1844 he organized the secret &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;Council of Fifty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, whose purpose was explicitly &amp;ldquo;to symbolize and represent a future &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;theocratic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;theodemocratic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Kingdom of God on the earth&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Fifty%23:~:text%3D,the%2520Second%2520Coming%2520of%2520Jesus&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805657337&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3kVEiK5NZlNDg3luR3R31y"&gt;en.wikipedia.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Smith even ran for U.S. President on a platform of restoring liberty under God. The Council&amp;rsquo;s records speak of a coming millennial polity in which Christ would reign, and Smith foresaw Mormons governing a New Jerusalem. (LDS teaching held that during the Millennium Jesus will be &amp;ldquo;king of this new world government,&amp;rdquo; whose structure was planned to be quasi-republican&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Fifty%23:~:text%3DSmith%2520%2520in%25201844%2520to,the%2520%252054%2520of%2520Jesus&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805657896&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1RhQJVW0a8VFcDhq6m0Cvo"&gt;en.wikipedia.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;.) In 19th&amp;#8209;century Mormon talk, America&amp;rsquo;s Constitution was &amp;ldquo;of no worth&amp;rdquo; after the Millennium and the Saints would build Zion according to celestial law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This messianic-political impulse was fundamentally &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;mythic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;in Eliade&amp;rsquo;s sense: it framed time as a cycle of sacred eras. Early Latter&amp;#8209;day Saints saw themselves living out the dramatis personae of scriptures (Book of Mormon, Bible, Revelation). The temple endowment ceremony, introduced in Nauvoo, reenacted the Edenic creation, the fall, and the gathering of Israel &amp;ndash; literally bringing the preterrestrial &amp;ldquo;plan of salvation&amp;rdquo; into ritual time. Eliade would note that such rituals create an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;eternal return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;to primordial time; indeed LDS temples were designed as terrestrial reflections of heaven (the Salt Lake Temple as an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;axis mundi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the city)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.timesandseasons.org/2004/08/eliade-mormonism-and-theories-of-religion-v/%23:~:text%3Dsome%2520of%2520his%2520major%2520insights,reference%2520point%2520for%2520the%2520city&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805659031&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1eF06F4fe4Geg0JhbIye30"&gt;archive.timesandseasons.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Adam&amp;rsquo;s story, Elijah&amp;rsquo;s powers, and the eventual return of Enoch and Zion were all taught as imminent realities. In short, early Mormonism was steeped in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;mythic cosmology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a sacred history that unfolded across ages (pre&amp;#8209;existence, mortality, Millennium) rather than the linear demystified history of Enlightenment Protestantism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c5"&gt;Routinizing Revelation: From Charisma to Bureaucracy&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Marxist and Weberian theory illuminate how this cosmic, radical movement then transformed into a modern institution. Weber described how &amp;ldquo;charismatic&amp;rdquo; movements must institutionalize or perish. Mormon history epitomizes this: after Smith&amp;rsquo;s martyrdom the church faced the Weberian task of translating &amp;ldquo;ground&amp;#8209;breaking and world&amp;#8209;making revelations into a set of handbooks and teacher&amp;rsquo;s manuals&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bycommonconsent.com/2016/04/21/on-the-routinization-bureaucratization-and-correlation-of-charisma-max-weber-and-the-mormons/%23:~:text%3DBut%2520Weber%2520can%2520help%2520us,that%2520are%2520also%2520very%2520real&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805660229&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3QGhMBusTmHvGtiGVCH2BR"&gt;bycommonconsent.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. By the late 19th century Brigham Young and successors turned the church into a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;bureaucratic organization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;. Revelation was disciplined into coded scriptures (Doctrine &amp;amp; Covenants) and rules; the living prophet&amp;rsquo;s role was reserved to a First Presidency with a quorum of twelve apostles; local government and education came under church auspices. The charismatic frenzy of Missouri or Kirtland was tamed by new legitimacy claims: prophetic heritage, scriptural canon, and sacred ordinances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 20th century saw further routinization. Under leaders like David O. McKay and especially during the &amp;ldquo;Era of Standardization&amp;rdquo; (circa 1960s&amp;ndash;70s), the Church consolidated authority into a global bureaucracy. A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;correlation program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;systematized all lesson manuals, budgets, and publications under priesthood oversight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bycommonconsent.com/2017/07/06/death-by-correlation-committee/%23:~:text%3Dculminating%2520in%2520the%25201960s%252C%2520a,teachers%2520in%2520the%2520church%2520are&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805661622&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1-oVPneEqeCusARN6TKWeR"&gt;bycommonconsent.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

Decentralized &amp;ldquo;rogue&amp;rdquo; sermons and local folklore were largely stamped out, replaced by bland, centrally approved curriculum. In Weberian terms, the Mormon church became a textbook case of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;routinization of charisma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: spiritual spontaneity gave way to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;legal-rational authority&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;and bureaucratic order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bycommonconsent.com/2016/04/21/on-the-routinization-bureaucratization-and-correlation-of-charisma-max-weber-and-the-mormons/%23:~:text%3DBut%2520Weber%2520can%2520help%2520us,that%2520are%2520also%2520very%2520real&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805662649&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2FcXtjLAyfdBmUT-eR1KHF"&gt;bycommonconsent.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the 1970s the transformation was complete: LDS worship and practice were almost entirely standardized worldwide. Lavish temples and tabernacles proliferated globally, but their rituals and furnishings became homogeneous. The exuberant, apocalyptic message of early leaders &amp;ndash; about common lands, imminent kingdoms, and Adam-God &amp;ndash; was toned down or quietly abandoned. The Church&amp;rsquo;s own historical narratives were sanitized (e.g. polygamy minimized, Adam-God officially denounced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Brigham_Young_and_Adam-God_theory%23:~:text%3DBrigham%2520Young%2520taught%2520that%2520Adam%252C,man%252C%2520was%2520God%2520the%2520Father&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805663381&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1qz_HSAIEpvrbMVOv5uuGL"&gt;fairlatterdaysaints.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;). Instead, the focus shifted to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;individual family and corporate success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;. In worship services, a modest &amp;ldquo;Restoration&amp;rdquo; message emphasizing the familiar themes of family, faith, and work ethic replaced the old radicalism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== &lt;span class="c5"&gt;Self-Colonization and Neoliberal Accommodation&lt;/span&gt; ===
&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This institutional drift can be seen as a kind of self-colonization. Once a sect at odds with America, the LDS Church gradually colonized itself by internalizing prevailing bourgeois norms. Kathleen Flake calls the early-20th-century response to the Reed Smoot hearings &amp;ldquo;The Great Accommodation&amp;rdquo;: facing scrutiny, Mormons adopted &amp;ldquo;the terms in which [the nation] would accept Mormonism&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/themes/accommodation.html%23:~:text%3DMormonism%2527s%2520identity%2520radically%2520changed%2520as,see%2520this%2520in%2520the%2520testimony&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805664402&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3JKR-_IB5jasQ5yu4ZGDZx"&gt;pbs.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

During WWI and WWII, Mormons &amp;ldquo;over-subscribed&amp;rdquo; their draft quotas to prove they were &amp;ldquo;superpatriotic,&amp;rdquo; recasting themselves as model Americans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/themes/accommodation.html%23:~:text%3DThe%2520onset%2520of%2520World%2520War,requiring%252C%2520at%2520the%2520same%2520time&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805665135&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3b0uz2wS2vcBdJI0h4sMX3"&gt;pbs.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;. The Church publicly embraced patriotism, business success, and conservative morality (antivice campaigns), aligning with the mid-century Republican-Protestant consensus. The powerful LDS lobby even argued that Mormon welfare doctrines mirrored New Deal social gospel (rather than critique capitalism).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under late 20th-century neoliberalism the accommodation became deeper. Mormon theology ceased to challenge capitalism; in fact, it sanctified free-market virtues. Brighamite wealth and self-reliance became doctrinal cornerstones, and overt class critique vanished. The Church accumulated corporate assets (insurance, real estate, media) and taught members entrepreneurship and home ownership. Social life was organized on family-centered, consumer lines (family home evenings, home building contests, college tuition subsidies) rather than communal sharing. Religious identity became &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;aestheticized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;and privatized: ritual practice still rich, but its revolutionary edge removed. In Benjaminian terms, what was once a politically charged, communal mythology has turned into a kind of apolitical &amp;ldquo;civil religion&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; scripture and temple life lend an aura of sacred order, but the aim is conformity and unity rather than liberation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The result is a world&amp;#8209;shrinking LDS trajectory. Where Joseph Smith once envisioned multiple worlds and theocracy, the modern Church offers a world&amp;#8209;now model: local congregations in every nation, a universally rationalized organizational chart, and an emphasis on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;personal salvation and social conservatism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Orthodox Mormonism today reproduces mainstream norms (middle-class domesticity, entrepreneurial drive, bureaucratic governance) far more than it seeks to expand cosmic horizons. The utopian &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;Zion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;has been replaced by ward council meetings; millennial anticipation is channeled into temple attendance quotas. In the language of religious sociology, early Mormonism&amp;rsquo;s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c6"&gt;maximally enchanted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;, anti-capitalist orientation has been largely subsumed by a neoliberal-capitalist logic of self-improvement and institutional stability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nonetheless, echoes of the old dispensation survive in the Church&amp;rsquo;s rhetoric of hope and unity. Terms like &amp;ldquo;Zion&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;eternal progression&amp;rdquo; remain in hymnals, and welfare service recalls communal beginnings. Yet these now coexist with (and often serve) an ethos of conformity. The Mormon journey from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;world-expanding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;prophet-dream to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;world-normalizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;bureaucracy mirrors a broader pattern: radical religious movements often start by imagining a radically different cosmos, only to end by settling into the contours of the prevailing social order. Early Mormonism&amp;rsquo;s radical cosmic re-enchantment and communal economy gave way, in the era of correlation and globalization, to a corporate structure and aestheticized faith aligned with late modern capitalism. This arc&amp;mdash;from prophets who sought to overthrow old orders to a Church that upholds them&amp;mdash;illustrates both the transformative potential of religion and its capacity for self-domestication in modern society.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c0"&gt;&lt;span class="c8"&gt;Sources:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Scholarly analyses and historical documents on early LDS theology and practice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mrm.org/ex-nihilo%23:~:text%3DAccording%2520to%2520LDS%2520teaching%252C%2520finite,is%2520limited%2520by%2520natural%2520law&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805668770&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3ejLveZmBe9wQKGK4SJmjq"&gt;mrm.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.timesandseasons.org/2009/02/mormonism-and-communal-studies/%23:~:text%3DNineteenth,family%2520by%2520embracing%2520plural%2520marriage&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805669002&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0KcBG27qH8d6geunv39isW"&gt;archive.timesandseasons.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Order%23:~:text%3DThe%2520United%2520Order%2520established%2520egalitarian,which&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805669223&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0YtjhXqWM4hNtj5Xz1aH8v"&gt;en.wikipedia.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Fifty%23:~:text%3D,the%2520Second%2520Coming%2520of%2520Jesus&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805669416&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0vUuPfW8CJp4tQl5aOmkc4"&gt;en.wikipedia.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;; critiques and histories of Mormon communalism and politics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.religioussocialism.org/excavating_socialist_thought_in_mormonism_re_reading_hugh_nibley%23:~:text%3DStill%252C%2520times%2520can%2520change,%25E2%2580%259D&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805669759&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1Ck7dzqwiey4tezSI7BE0P"&gt;religioussocialism.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/themes/accommodation.html%23:~:text%3DMormonism%2527s%2520identity%2520radically%2520changed%2520as,see%2520this%2520in%2520the%2520testimony&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805669978&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw11OhXR6i8LWfrhtlRDk8ve"&gt;pbs.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;; LDS scriptures and writings on material cosmology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mrm.org/ex-nihilo%23:~:text%3DAccording%2520to%2520LDS%2520teaching%252C%2520finite,is%2520limited%2520by%2520natural%2520law&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805670224&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2_BCVFYSagiISsCxO2y3Mq"&gt;mrm.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V50N03_14.pdf%23:~:text%3D46%2520Dialogue%252C%2520Fall%25202017%2520This,is%2520true%2520of%2520Mormon%2520monism&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805670421&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2nHpN2OKx74gaOLZOyHtTq"&gt;dialoguejournal.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;; contemporary accounts of institutional rationalization and correlation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c9"&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bycommonconsent.com/2017/07/06/death-by-correlation-committee/%23:~:text%3Dculminating%2520in%2520the%25201960s%252C%2520a,teachers%2520in%2520the%2520church%2520are&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1746582805670671&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2FtrOfEfbD1rB9okTwgSkD"&gt;bycommonconsent.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c21 c10"&gt;&lt;span class="c3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c10 c21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Over the 20th century many Buddhist intellectuals in China, Japan, Korea and India explicitly sought to align Buddhist and Marxist worldviews. For example, James Shields highlights that early-20th-century Asian Buddhists tried to reconcile Buddhist “awakening” with Marxist “liberation,” examining terms like alienation and materialism in Buddhist context.&lt;ref&gt;[https://digitalcommons.bucknell.edu/fac\_books/270/#:\~:text=Although%20it%20is%20only%20in,Over%20the%20past%20century%2C%20numerous](https://digitalcommons.bucknell.edu/fac_books/270/#:~:text=Although%20it%20is%20only%20in,Over%20the%20past%20century%2C%20numerous)&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, Marxist thinkers such as Rahul Sankrityayan (1893–1963) openly aimed for a “creative synthesis” of Buddhist and Marxist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ijmra.us/project%20doc/2019/IJRSS\_FEBRUARY2019/IJMRA-15088.pdf#:\~:text=philosophy%20which%20could%20translate%20his,synthesis%20of%20these%20two%20philosophies](https://www.ijmra.us/project%20doc/2019/IJRSS_FEBRUARY2019/IJMRA-15088.pdf#:~:text=philosophy%20which%20could%20translate%20his,synthesis%20of%20these%20two%20philosophies)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sankrityayan’s 1970 collection *Buddhism: The Marxist Approach* even includes a chapter titled “Buddhist Dialectics”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nla.gov.au/nla.cat-vn611801#:\~:text=,Sharma](https://nla.gov.au/nla.cat-vn611801#:~:text=,Sharma)&lt;/ref&gt;

B.R. Ambedkar’s Navayāna Buddhism likewise proclaimed a congruence of Buddhist ethics and socialism, famously urging that liberty and fraternity must accompany equality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.culturematters.org.uk/marxism-buddhism-and-socialism/#:\~:text=Society%20has%20been%20aiming%20to,35%20Buddha%20or%20Karl](https://www.culturematters.org.uk/marxism-buddhism-and-socialism/#:~:text=Society%20has%20been%20aiming%20to,35%20Buddha%20or%20Karl)&lt;/ref&gt;

**Lin Qiuwu and Chinese/Taiwanese Buddhism:** A striking case is Lin Qiuwu (林求武, 1897–1963), who recast Buddhism as a rational philosophy suited to social reform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:\~:text=the%20present%20society,order%20to%20put%20it%20to](https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:~:text=the%20present%20society,order%20to%20put%20it%20to)&lt;/ref&gt; In articles like “Class Struggle and Buddhism,” he fused Tiantai (Tendai) and Huayan (Kegon) metaphysics with Marxist class analysis. Lin drew on the Tiantai idea of a single “Absolute Mind” or Middle-Way Buddha-Nature uniting all phenomena,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:\~:text=Chinese%20Buddhism%20is%20rich%20in,this%20basis%20the%20Tiantai%20school](https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:~:text=Chinese%20Buddhism%20is%20rich%20in,this%20basis%20the%20Tiantai%20school)&lt;/ref&gt; and on Huayan’s motto *shi shi wu ai* (no-obstruction among all dharmas) to stress that every element is interconnected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:\~:text=used%20various%20arguments%20to%20go,to%20go%20beyond%20philosophical%20speculation](https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:~:text=used%20various%20arguments%20to%20go,to%20go%20beyond%20philosophical%20speculation)&lt;/ref&gt; Framing this “unitive vision” through his term “one buddha” (yi fo), Lin argued that individual and cosmic bodies form a single great Buddha-body.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:\~:text=The%20myriad%20phenomena%20in%20the,1934%3A12%3B%20reproduced%20in%20Yang%201991%3A51](https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:~:text=The%20myriad%20phenomena%20in%20the,1934%3A12%3B%20reproduced%20in%20Yang%201991%3A51)&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective class divisions arise only from the false view of a separate self: once people realize the “non-duality of mind, buddha, and sentient beings,” greed and class conflict disappear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:\~:text=How%20do%20human%20beings%20give,Because%20they%20have](https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:~:text=How%20do%20human%20beings%20give,Because%20they%20have)&lt;/ref&gt; As Lin put it, the Buddhist attitude to class struggle is to “stand within the no-self that is also the Great Self” and cherish the propertyless masses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:\~:text=When%20Buddhism%20calls%20people%20to,cherish%20the%20propertyless%20masses%20and](https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:~:text=When%20Buddhism%20calls%20people%20to,cherish%20the%20propertyless%20masses%20and)&lt;/ref&gt; In short, Lin saw Marxist revolution as a secular “Pure Land” project: awakening to Buddha-nature would naturally wither away classes without coercion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:\~:text=When%20Buddhism%20calls%20people%20to,cherish%20the%20propertyless%20masses%20and](https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:~:text=When%20Buddhism%20calls%20people%20to,cherish%20the%20propertyless%20masses%20and)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:\~:text=How%20do%20human%20beings%20give,Because%20they%20have](https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:~:text=How%20do%20human%20beings%20give,Because%20they%20have)&lt;/ref&gt;

**Japanese Tendai/Nichiren Movements:** In Japan, the *Shinkō Bukkyō* (New Buddhist) youth movements of the 1930s tried similar syntheses. Notably Seno’o Girō (妹尾義郎, 1890–1961), a Nichiren (Tendai-lineage) priest, combined Lotus-Sutra ideas with Marxism. Seno’o co-founded the “League for Revitalizing Buddhism” and later renounced sectarian Buddhism to address capitalism. He explicitly called for abolishing both the Buddhist sects and the capitalist system, advocating a new society of “common property and common prosperity”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5ca3/6237c90dfbafea24454a519d2b0bc9e4c099.pdf#:\~:text=loyal%20to%20their%20sects%2C%20Seno%27o,of%20Religious%20Studies%2011%2F1%201984](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5ca3/6237c90dfbafea24454a519d2b0bc9e4c099.pdf#:~:text=loyal%20to%20their%20sects%2C%20Seno%27o,of%20Religious%20Studies%2011%2F1%201984)&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1930s essays Seno’o critiqued “moral Marxism” for ignoring religion, but also rejected purely spiritual responses, insisting that material well-being go hand-in-hand with realizing emptiness and selflessness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5ca3/6237c90dfbafea24454a519d2b0bc9e4c099.pdf#:\~:text=endorse%20totally%20the%20Marxists%2C%20either%2C,th%20of%20selflessness%2C%20emptiness%20and](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5ca3/6237c90dfbafea24454a519d2b0bc9e4c099.pdf#:~:text=endorse%20totally%20the%20Marxists%2C%20either%2C,th%20of%20selflessness%2C%20emptiness%20and)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5ca3/6237c90dfbafea24454a519d2b0bc9e4c099.pdf#:\~:text=loyal%20to%20their%20sects%2C%20Seno%27o,of%20Religious%20Studies%2011%2F1%201984](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5ca3/6237c90dfbafea24454a519d2b0bc9e4c099.pdf#:~:text=loyal%20to%20their%20sects%2C%20Seno%27o,of%20Religious%20Studies%2011%2F1%201984)&lt;/ref&gt; (His execution in 1961 made him a Buddhist martyr of socialist ideals.)

**Korean Minjung Buddhism:** During the 1970s–80s pro-democracy movement, Minjung Buddhists (often influenced by Ch’ŏnt’ae/Tendai) forged a Marxist-inflected Buddhist discourse. As one account notes, they “derived their theoretical framework from Buddhist philosophy, adapted via Marxist theory,” searching for Buddhist doctrines that echoed Marxist egalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/korean-buddhism/#:\~:text=Minjung%20Buddhists%20derived%20their%20theoretical,discourse%20and%20highlighted%20how%20Minjung](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/korean-buddhism/#:~:text=Minjung%20Buddhists%20derived%20their%20theoretical,discourse%20and%20highlighted%20how%20Minjung)&lt;/ref&gt; They pointed out parallels: both early Buddhism and Marxism emphasize atheism, material conditions, empiricism and communal equality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/korean-buddhism/#:\~:text=Minjung%20Buddhists%20derived%20their%20theoretical,discourse%20and%20highlighted%20how%20Minjung](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/korean-buddhism/#:~:text=Minjung%20Buddhists%20derived%20their%20theoretical,discourse%20and%20highlighted%20how%20Minjung)&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental Mahayana concepts were reinterpreted in class terms. For instance, dependent arising was seen as showing history woven from countless lives, justifying social engagement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/korean-buddhism/#:\~:text=The%20principle%20of%20dependent%20arising,the%20capacity%20to%20promote%20change](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/korean-buddhism/#:~:text=The%20principle%20of%20dependent%20arising,the%20capacity%20to%20promote%20change)&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of karma became human action (and dialectical “motion”) shaping history: Minjung thinkers even equated Marx’s principle of continual change with the karmic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/korean-buddhism/#:\~:text=Minjung%20Buddhists%20also%20understood%20karma,part%20of%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20overall](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/korean-buddhism/#:~:text=Minjung%20Buddhists%20also%20understood%20karma,part%20of%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20overall)&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately they redefined the Pure Land ideal: instead of a distant afterlife, it was a communist society to be built “when we strive to overcome the contradictions of society.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/korean-buddhism/#:\~:text=Minjung%20Buddhists%20aimed%20to%20establish,Buddhists%20envisioned%20a%20social%20revolution](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/korean-buddhism/#:~:text=Minjung%20Buddhists%20aimed%20to%20establish,Buddhists%20envisioned%20a%20social%20revolution)&lt;/ref&gt;

**Indian Context (Mahayana):** Outside East Asia, some 20th-century Indian Buddhists also blended Marxist ideas. Rahul Sankrityayan, originally a Buddhist scholar, became a communist in the 1930s and explicitly sought a “synthesis of Buddhist &amp; Marxist philosophy.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ijmra.us/project%20doc/2019/IJRSS\_FEBRUARY2019/IJMRA-15088.pdf#:\~:text=philosophy%20which%20could%20translate%20his,synthesis%20of%20these%20two%20philosophies](https://www.ijmra.us/project%20doc/2019/IJRSS_FEBRUARY2019/IJMRA-15088.pdf#:~:text=philosophy%20which%20could%20translate%20his,synthesis%20of%20these%20two%20philosophies)&lt;/ref&gt; His anthology *Buddhist Dialectics* (1970) is a rare example of published “Buddhist socialism.” (The Dalit leader B.R. Ambedkar similarly saw Buddhism’s emphasis on equality as compatible with socialist goals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.culturematters.org.uk/marxism-buddhism-and-socialism/#:\~:text=Society%20has%20been%20aiming%20to,35%20Buddha%20or%20Karl](https://www.culturematters.org.uk/marxism-buddhism-and-socialism/#:~:text=Society%20has%20been%20aiming%20to,35%20Buddha%20or%20Karl)&lt;/ref&gt;)

**Modern Scholarship:** In recent decades a modest academic literature analyzes such syntheses. Charles Jones (2000) documents Lin Qiuwu’s thought;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:\~:text=On%20a%20more%20abstract%20philosophical,the%20many%20to%20the%20one](https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:~:text=On%20a%20more%20abstract%20philosophical,the%20many%20to%20the%20one)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:\~:text=When%20Buddhism%20calls%20people%20to,cherish%20the%20propertyless%20masses%20and](https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:~:text=When%20Buddhism%20calls%20people%20to,cherish%20the%20propertyless%20masses%20and)&lt;/ref&gt; Karsten Struhl (2017) explicitly compares Buddhist and Marxist “noble truths,” arguing that overcoming suffering requires both extinguishing the ego and building a classless society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/40343254/Buddhism\_and\_Marxism\_points\_of\_intersection#:\~:text=analyses%20of%20the%20causes%20of,this%20requires%20extinguishing%20the%20illusion](https://www.academia.edu/40343254/Buddhism_and_Marxism_points_of_intersection#:~:text=analyses%20of%20the%20causes%20of,this%20requires%20extinguishing%20the%20illusion)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/40343254/Buddhism\_and\_Marxism\_points\_of\_intersection#:\~:text=of%20self%20and%20its%20attendant,attaining%20Nirvana%20will%2C%20for%20the](https://www.academia.edu/40343254/Buddhism_and_Marxism_points_of_intersection#:~:text=of%20self%20and%20its%20attendant,attaining%20Nirvana%20will%2C%20for%20the)&lt;/ref&gt; Struhl notes that “capitalism both feeds on and reinforces” the Buddhist “illusion of self” through exploitation,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/40343254/Buddhism\_and\_Marxism\_points\_of\_intersection#:\~:text=analyses%20of%20the%20causes%20of,this%20requires%20extinguishing%20the%20illusion](https://www.academia.edu/40343254/Buddhism_and_Marxism_points_of_intersection#:~:text=analyses%20of%20the%20causes%20of,this%20requires%20extinguishing%20the%20illusion)&lt;/ref&gt; implying that Buddhist renunciation and Marxist revolution can be mutually enlightening. James Shields (2022) surveys Chinese Buddhist socialism efforts and highlights similar parallels between Buddhist awakening and Marxist emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://digitalcommons.bucknell.edu/fac\_books/270/#:\~:text=Although%20it%20is%20only%20in,Over%20the%20past%20century%2C%20numerous](https://digitalcommons.bucknell.edu/fac_books/270/#:~:text=Although%20it%20is%20only%20in,Over%20the%20past%20century%2C%20numerous)&lt;/ref&gt; These works often conclude that Buddhism and Marxism can “mutually enrich” each other, with Marxism providing a social praxis to complement Buddhist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/40343254/Buddhism\_and\_Marxism\_points\_of\_intersection#:\~:text=analyses%20of%20the%20causes%20of,this%20requires%20extinguishing%20the%20illusion](https://www.academia.edu/40343254/Buddhism_and_Marxism_points_of_intersection#:~:text=analyses%20of%20the%20causes%20of,this%20requires%20extinguishing%20the%20illusion)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/40343254/Buddhism\_and\_Marxism\_points\_of\_intersection#:\~:text=of%20self%20and%20its%20attendant,attaining%20Nirvana%20will%2C%20for%20the](https://www.academia.edu/40343254/Buddhism_and_Marxism_points_of_intersection#:~:text=of%20self%20and%20its%20attendant,attaining%20Nirvana%20will%2C%20for%20the)&lt;/ref&gt;

**Image: Huayan (Kegon) Buddhism’s Indra’s Net**, symbolizing universal interpenetration. Each jewel reflects all others—just as Lin Qiuwu noted that “each individual element within the great unity is intimately interconnected.” Contemporary writers observe that this holographic vision can encompass even capitalist society (“billboards and boardrooms”) within a single dialectical web.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/80578479/Incorporating\_mindfulness\_questioning\_capitalism#:\~:text=Huayan%20Buddhism%27s%20mesmerizing%20metaphysics%20of,Christian%20Studies%2024%20%282004](https://www.academia.edu/80578479/Incorporating_mindfulness_questioning_capitalism#:~:text=Huayan%20Buddhism%27s%20mesmerizing%20metaphysics%20of,Christian%20Studies%2024%20%282004)&lt;/ref&gt;

**Dialectical interdependence:** Huayan’s metaphors (Indra’s Net) and Tendai’s “One Mind” doctrines naturally resonate with Marx’s dialectical view that all things are connected and in flux. Early Buddhism’s *pratītya-samutpāda* (dependent arising) functions as a “tapestry woven from the threads of individual lives,” analogous to Marx’s totalizing historical dialectic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/korean-buddhism/#:\~:text=The%20principle%20of%20dependent%20arising,the%20capacity%20to%20promote%20change](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/korean-buddhism/#:~:text=The%20principle%20of%20dependent%20arising,the%20capacity%20to%20promote%20change)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/80578479/Incorporating\_mindfulness\_questioning\_capitalism#:\~:text=Huayan%20Buddhism%27s%20mesmerizing%20metaphysics%20of,Christian%20Studies%2024%20%282004](https://www.academia.edu/80578479/Incorporating_mindfulness_questioning_capitalism#:~:text=Huayan%20Buddhism%27s%20mesmerizing%20metaphysics%20of,Christian%20Studies%2024%20%282004)&lt;/ref&gt;

**Emptiness and class:** Buddhist *anattā* (no‐self) or emptiness was read as critiquing individualism and private ownership. Modern analysts similarly see capitalism as feeding “the greed and possessiveness which, for Buddhism, is rooted in the illusion of self.” Thus “extinguishing the illusion of self” is paralleled by abolishing class divisions: both are conditions for ending dukkha.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:\~:text=How%20do%20human%20beings%20give,Because%20they%20have](https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:~:text=How%20do%20human%20beings%20give,Because%20they%20have)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/40343254/Buddhism\_and\_Marxism\_points\_of\_intersection#:\~:text=%28the%20third%20noble%20truth%29,attaining%20Nirvana%20will%2C%20for%20the](https://www.academia.edu/40343254/Buddhism_and_Marxism_points_of_intersection#:~:text=%28the%20third%20noble%20truth%29,attaining%20Nirvana%20will%2C%20for%20the)&lt;/ref&gt;

**Non-duality and Buddha-nature:** The Mahayana idea that Buddhahood is latent in all beings (Tiantai’s “Middle-Way Buddha-Nature”) was used to argue that workers and capitalists alike share a common reality. Lin’s “one buddha” concept posited a single life or being behind all phenomena. This non-dual vision suggests a fundamental equality of all things—an idea compatible with Marxist calls for an egalitarian society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:\~:text=Chinese%20Buddhism%20is%20rich%20in,this%20basis%20the%20Tiantai%20school](https://www.globalbuddhism.org/article/download/1081/916/2115#:~:text=Chinese%20Buddhism%20is%20rich%20in,this%20basis%20the%20Tiantai%20school)&lt;/ref&gt;

In sum, from Lin Qiuwu’s 1930s essays to contemporary studies, Mahayana metaphysics (interdependence, non-duality, no-self, Buddha-nature) is treated as complementary to Marxist critique, while Marxism provides a practical framework for Buddhism’s ethical goals.

The traditions of god-worshipping in Ancient Egypt are quite well known in modern culture. The association with mummification, animal heads, and pyramids is iconic to us. 

But what is less well known is how Ancient Egypt has the first documented case of monotheism with Akhenaten. 

People often cite Zarathustra or Judaism as the first example of monotheism. And there is a good reason for this. Zoroastrianism and Judaism both continue to exist today, albeit in rather small and marginalized forms relative to the dominant monotheistic religions of the world. 

The traditions of God-worshipping in Ancient Egypt are quite well-known. The association with practices such as mummification and imagery such as animal-headed gods is iconic to us, as well as, of course, pyramids. But what is less known is how Egypt has the first documented case of monotheism in all of human history with Akhenaten. 

Now, people often cite Zoroastrianism or Judaism as being the first case of monotheism, and there is something to that idea—it's not just nothing. Because those two religions both have survived to the modern day, whereas Atenism has not survived to the modern day. And also, if you look at the mythical narratives of those two religions, Judaism having a clearly defined timeline, and Zoroastrianism not as much, both do place their foundings as being earlier than Akhenaten, with Zarathustra likely having lived a few centuries before Akhenaten, and Abraham having lived even further in the past.

However, though, neither of these traditions actually [has] recorded—actually, however, these are not attested to at the actual times that they are said to have occurred in. Whether Moses or Zarathustra were historical figures is up for debate. But regardless, Zoroastrianism—regardless, I will talk about in future chapters how it doesn't seem likely that either tradition was monotheistic at this time.

[Cut previous paragraph per instruction.]

Egyptian mythology and the ancient Egyptian traditions of god-worshipping are notable among the four monotheism case studies that I will go over for how they managed to effectively push back against monotheism and defeat it. Now, in the end, they didn't manage to maintain their traditions. We face the unfortunate reality that Egypt has now converted to Islam and worships only one god, but Egypt managed to resist monotheism and keep its polytheistic tradition for... over 1,500 years after the first attempt to make it monotheistic.

This is very impressive, and it suggests that Egyptian civilization is one that we can look to for examples for the preservation of polytheism.

Egypt has a rich archaeological record of its traditions. It is the place in the world that first invented writing, so we have what one might think would be a good record of exactly what happened in Egypt and how Egyptian religion [or theology] formed.

Although, ironically, the rather sparse adoption of writing and lack of continuity potentially makes it harder to understand Egyptian theology—at least in the early stages—versus a country such as Japan, where the relatively quick adoption of writing made it much easier to pinpoint exactly what was going on in various situations.

=== Predynastic and Early Dynastic Origins of Egyptian Religious Practice ===

In Egypt’s Predynastic period, archaeological evidence reveals nascent religious practices centered on local cults, burial rites, and animal veneration. One remarkable example is the painted tomb at Hierakonpolis (Nekhen), which depicts ritual boats and a figure flanked by lions, likely a proto-divinity or ruler, indicating early mythic or cultic scenes &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hierakonpolis - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierakonpolis#:~:text=It%20is%20presumed%20that%20the,158%2C%20gazelles%2C%20and%20cattle&lt;/ref&gt;. Hierakonpolis itself was a major Predynastic cult center dedicated to the falcon god Horus; it boasted one of Egypt’s earliest temples and was regarded as the city where Horus’s body was entombed according to later tradition &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hierakonpolis - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierakonpolis#:~:text=Nekhen%20was%20the%20center%20of,8&lt;/ref&gt;. This site yielded the famous '''Narmer Palette''' (c. 3100 BCE), one of the first depictions of Egyptian kingship entwined with divine symbols (such as the cow-headed goddess Bat at the top), underscoring how political authority and sacred iconography were intertwined from the start &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hierakonpolis - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierakonpolis#:~:text=Painted%20Tomb%2C%20is%20located%20in,artifacts%20from%20the%20predynastic%20period&lt;/ref&gt;. In the late Predynastic Naqada III period, Upper Egypt was unified under Abydos, and elite tombs at sites like Abydos and Saqqara became focal points of ritual activity, presaging the state’s investment in funerary cults &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hierakonpolis - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierakonpolis#:~:text=related%20to%20the%20rituals%20of,with%20kingship%20in%20Ancient%20Egypt&lt;/ref&gt;.

By the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3100–2686 BCE), regional cults coalesced around state ideologies. Archaeology shows that even in the Delta, centers like *Tell el-Farkha* functioned as early administrative and cult hubs &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Tell el-Farkha  --&gt;https://pcma.uw.edu.pl/en/2019/01/14/tell-el-farkha/#:~:text=Farkha,first%20appeared%20in%20the%20Delta&lt;/ref&gt;. Many symbols of later Egyptian religion have roots in this era: for instance, the cobra and vulture deities (Wadjet of Buto and Nekhbet of Elkab) already served as patron goddesses of Lower and Upper Egypt, respectively, reflecting in royal regalia the “Two Ladies” who personified unified rulership. Animal worship was likewise present from prehistoric times – '''sacred animals''' such as the ibis (later associated with Thoth) were revered as early as 5300–3000 BCE &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Sacred animals of ancient Egypt | Reading Museum--&gt;https://www.readingmuseum.org.uk/blog/sacred-animals-ancient-egypt#:~:text=Ibis&lt;/ref&gt;. The '''Apis bull''' cult of Memphis, which became hugely important in later times, was reportedly known since the 1st Dynasty &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Apis (deity) - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apis_(deity)#:~:text=Worship%20of%20an%20Apis%20bull%2C,4&lt;/ref&gt;. Early Egyptian tombs often included animal burials or motifs: at Hierakonpolis, a menagerie of wild animals was kept and ritually interred (c. 3500 BCE), suggesting a cultic respect for powerful creatures and perhaps their sacrifice in ritual contexts &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hierakonpolis - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierakonpolis#:~:text=The%20oldest%20known%20zoological%20collection,30&lt;/ref&gt;. These formative centuries established the essential pattern of Egyptian religion: local sacred sites with temples or shrines to tutelary gods, royal patronage of cults to legitimize political power, and elaborate burial practices to secure an afterlife.

Early royal '''tombs and funerary enclosures''' illustrate how religious ideology spurred architectural innovation. Kings of Dynasty 0 and Dynasties 1–2 were buried at Abydos (Umm el-Qa’ab) in tombs that became pilgrimage sites in later eras, while large mastaba tombs for officials appear at Saqqara and even in the Delta &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Tell el-Farkha  --&gt;https://pcma.uw.edu.pl/en/2019/01/14/tell-el-farkha/#:~:text=Farkha,first%20appeared%20in%20the%20Delta&lt;/ref&gt;. Notably, the Egyptians began to construct above-ground ritual enclosures (such as those of King Khasekhemwy at Abydos) where funerary ceremonies and royal jubilees (Heb-Sed festivals) may have been held, underlining the early fusion of kingship with religious ritual. By the end of the Early Dynastic period, a fairly standardized iconography of divine kingship was in place – the king as the *Hor(us) incarnate*, wearing the Red and White Crowns, smiting enemies with gods looking on – a theme already visible on objects like the Narmer Palette and maceheads. In summary, Predynastic and Early Dynastic sites give us critical material evidence of nascent Egyptian religion: painted tombs, proto-temples, cultic animal burials, and the first signs of Egypt’s pantheon (Horus, Hathor/Bat, Min, Wadjit, Nekhbet, etc.) all point to a rich cultic life that laid the foundation for Pharaonic religious traditions &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hierakonpolis - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierakonpolis#:~:text=It%20is%20presumed%20that%20the,158%2C%20gazelles%2C%20and%20cattle&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hierakonpolis - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierakonpolis#:~:text=Nekhen%20was%20the%20center%20of,8&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Old and Middle Kingdom Evolution of Temples, Priesthoods, and Mortuary Architecture===

 &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--File:Djoser's Step Pyramid.jpg - Wikimedia Commons--&gt;https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Djoser%27s_Step_Pyramid.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; *The Step Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara (Third Dynasty, c. 2667–2648 BCE), the earliest colossal stone building in Egypt. This pyramid and its adjoining temple complex formed the center of a mortuary cult, reflecting the Old Kingdom emphasis on the king’s divine afterlife &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Step Pyramid of Djoser |Description, Theories, &amp; Facts | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Step-Pyramid-of-Djoser#:~:text=Step%20Pyramid%20of%20Djoser%2C%20the,their%20power%20and%20wealth%2C%20as&lt;/ref&gt;.*  
During the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BCE), Egyptian religious architecture and institutions matured significantly. Royal mortuary complexes reached monumental scale: King Djoser’s '''Step Pyramid''' – “the oldest important stone building in Egypt” – rose at Saqqara as part of an extensive funerary complex, complete with temples, courtyards, and altars for offering rituals &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Step Pyramid of Djoser |Description, Theories, &amp; Facts | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Step-Pyramid-of-Djoser#:~:text=Step%20Pyramid%20of%20Djoser%2C%20the,their%20power%20and%20wealth%2C%20as&lt;/ref&gt;. Subsequent 4th Dynasty pharaohs constructed the great pyramids at Giza, each accompanied by a '''valley temple''', a causeway, and a '''mortuary temple''' at the pyramid’s base. These mortuary temples were the loci for the king’s *heb-sed* and daily offering cult after death, staffed by priests to present food, incense, and prayers to the deceased pharaoh’s ka. Not only did such complexes glorify the king’s power and wealth, they were also economic centers endowed with lands and personnel to sustain the cult in perpetuity &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Step Pyramid of Djoser |Description, Theories, &amp; Facts | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Step-Pyramid-of-Djoser#:~:text=Step%20Pyramid%20of%20Djoser%2C%20the,their%20power%20and%20wealth%2C%20as&lt;/ref&gt;. Within their sacred precincts, the living performed rituals to nourish the royal dead, an aspect of Egyptian religion that tightly bound kingship with divine order. It is noteworthy that even while dedicated to the king, these mortuary temples often invoked and hosted gods – for example, the sun god Ra or funerary deities – illustrating that “royal cult involves the gods, but equally… all cult of the gods involves the king” &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Egyptian temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_temple#:~:text=match%20at%20L713%2018%20,commemorate%20deceased%20kings%20and%20to&lt;/ref&gt;. The priesthoods serving these royal cults (often drawn from the royal family or high officials) gained prestige; over generations, some evolved into powerful families who managed temple estates, foreshadowing the influential priestly class of later periods &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Egyptian temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_temple#:~:text=,31&lt;/ref&gt;.

Parallel to mortuary architecture, the '''cult temples''' of gods also developed in form and organization. Unfortunately, few Old Kingdom non-mortuary temples survive, but later sources suggest they followed an '''open-air plan''' inspired by the solar cult. It is thought that Old Kingdom sanctuaries (for deities like Ra at '''Heliopolis''' or Ptah at Memphis) were open courts without roofed sanctums, reflecting worship under the sun – a design “owed most to the cult of the sun god Re at Heliopolis,” likely featuring an unobstructed space centered on a sacred stone or emblem of the god &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Cult temple | Egyptian tomb | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/cult-temple#:~:text=%E2%80%A6is%20generally%20thought%20that%20the,among%20cult%20temples%3B%20worship%20was&lt;/ref&gt;. Indeed, the Fifth Dynasty took solar worship to new heights (literally) by erecting dedicated '''Sun Temples''' (see next section). Old Kingdom cult temples, whether for gods or the royal ka, were maintained by an organized priesthood with ranks (wab priests, hem-netjer priests, etc.) and overseen by high priests (such as the High Priest of Ra at Heliopolis or of Ptah at Memphis). The state provided endowments to these temples, integrating religion into governance; pharaohs were seen as the chief priest of every cult, delegating daily duties to priests but asserting ultimate ritual authority &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Egyptian temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_temple#:~:text=rituals%20were%20seen%20as%20necessary,offerings%2C%20and%20seek%20oracular%20guidance&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Egyptian temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_temple#:~:text=supply%20its%20needs,significant%20challenges%20to%20his%20authority&lt;/ref&gt;. By the end of the Old Kingdom, religious texts start appearing in royal tombs (the '''Pyramid Texts''' of King Unas and others), indicating an increasingly sophisticated theology of afterlife and formal ritual language, likely developed by priestly scribes serving the mortuary cult.

The Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE) built upon these foundations while introducing new religious developments and architectural forms. Following a period of decentralization, the 11th- and 12th-Dynasty pharaohs reasserted central authority *and* reinvigorated state religion. '''Temples to gods''' proliferated and were lavishly supported by kings: for instance, at Thebes, the cult of '''Amun''' (a formerly minor local god) was elevated to national prominence, with pharaohs like Senusret I building or expanding the temple of Amun at Karnak (Luxor) early in the 12th Dynasty. Across Egypt, Middle Kingdom rulers restored old cult centers and founded new temples, reinforcing ideological continuity after the First Intermediate Period’s disruptions. In temple design, we begin to see elements that would become standard: pylons, peristyle courts, and an enclosed sanctuary for the deity’s statue. Although few Middle Kingdom temples survive intact (often being rebuilt in later eras), archaeological traces at sites like Medinet Maadi or Tod suggest typical layouts with offering halls and barque shrines. The priesthood likewise became more systematized; priests could be full-time specialists rather than part-time nobility, and certain high priest titles (e.g. High Priest of Amun) grew in political importance as temples amassed land and wealth.

Mortuary architecture in the Middle Kingdom evolved in response to both practical and theological changes. Kings still built '''pyramids''' (e.g. at Lisht, Dahshur, Hawara), but on a smaller scale and often using mudbrick cores, many of which are now heavily eroded. More innovatively, Nebhepetre '''Mentuhotep II''' (c. 2050 BCE) constructed a unique terraced '''mortuary temple''' at Deir el-Bahri that included his tomb within its complex. This temple incorporated '''architectural and religious innovations''': a multi-level colonnaded structure against the cliffs, with ambulatories and a centralized shrine, and it was *the first royal monument to explicitly identify the pharaoh with Osiris* (the god of the afterlife) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Mentuhotep II - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentuhotep_II#:~:text=Mentuhotep%20II%20was%20buried%20at,11&lt;/ref&gt;. In this design, Mentuhotep II’s own divine status after death is emphasized – statues of the king depicted as Osiris were found there – merging the cult of the king with that of a god. His temple set a precedent for New Kingdom rulers (notably it directly inspired Hatshepsut’s adjacent temple centuries later) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Mentuhotep II - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentuhotep_II#:~:text=Mentuhotep%20II%20was%20buried%20at,11&lt;/ref&gt;. Equally significant, Middle Kingdom private tombs (of nobles and officials) often feature stelae and inscriptions invoking Osiris and regional gods, showing that beliefs in the afterlife and personal piety were filtering beyond royalty. In sum, the Old and Middle Kingdoms saw the transformation of Egyptian religious practice into grand material forms: '''temples''' (both for gods and for deified kings) became large, permanent institutions of stone; a professional '''priesthood''' managed ritual life; and '''mortuary cults''' for the pharaoh ensured that kingship was enshrined as a sacred, eternal institution.

=== Solar Temples of the Old Kingdom: Development and Cessation===

In the Fifth Dynasty (c. 25th–24th century BCE), pharaonic devotion to the '''sun god Ra''' culminated in the construction of dedicated Sun Temples – a striking development in Egyptian cult practice. The dynasty’s founder, King '''Userkaf''', inaugurated this tradition by building a temple to Ra separate from his pyramid, and most of his 5th-Dynasty successors followed suit &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Egyptian sun temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_sun_temple#:~:text=Heliopolis%20.,1%20%5D%20The&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Egyptian sun temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_sun_temple#:~:text=,order%20to%20reconstruct%20the%20shape&lt;/ref&gt;. According to later tales, these kings had particular motivation: the Middle Kingdom '''Westcar Papyrus''' mythologizes the first Fifth-Dynasty rulers as actual sons of Ra, born to a priestess, suggesting the new dynasty emphasized solar legitimization to bolster their claim to rule &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Sun Temples at Abu Gurob – The Curious Egyptologist--&gt;https://thecuriousegyptologist.com/2022/07/25/the-sun-temples-at-abu-gurob/#:~:text=Dynasty%20pharaohs%20had%20good%20reason,but%20one%20took%20regnal%20names&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Sun Temples at Abu Gurob – The Curious Egyptologist--&gt;https://thecuriousegyptologist.com/2022/07/25/the-sun-temples-at-abu-gurob/#:~:text=that%20linked%20their%20power%20to,dynasty%20royal&lt;/ref&gt;. Indeed, almost every Fifth-Dynasty king adopted the epithet *Sa-Ra* (“Son of Ra”) in their royal titulary and took a throne name honoring the sun (e.g. Neferirkare, Sahure, Niuserre) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Sun Temples at Abu Gurob – The Curious Egyptologist--&gt;https://thecuriousegyptologist.com/2022/07/25/the-sun-temples-at-abu-gurob/#:~:text=were%20sons%20of%20the%20god,dynasty%20royal&lt;/ref&gt;. The Sun Temples, all erected in the Memphite region (at Abu Ghurab and Abusir, near Heliopolis), were thus ideological statements: they affirmed the king’s special relationship with Ra and likely served as centers for the state '''solar cult'''.

Architecturally and ritually, these Sun Temples had distinctive features. They were open-air complexes, aligning with the nature of solar worship, and lacked the dark inner sanctum typical of other Egyptian temples &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Cult temple | Egyptian tomb | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/cult-temple#:~:text=%E2%80%A6is%20generally%20thought%20that%20the,among%20cult%20temples%3B%20worship%20was&lt;/ref&gt;. Each temple was dominated by a colossal '''stone obelisk''' or benben-like monument, symbolizing the sun’s rays, erected on a massive pedestal. In front of this stood a large '''altar''' under the open sky. For example, Niuserre’s Sun Temple at Abu Ghurab – the best-preserved example – consists of a rectangular walled courtyard at whose western end the base of a huge obelisk remains, and at the eastern end, facing the sunrise, lies the altar &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Abu Gorab - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Gorab#:~:text=Inside%20the%20temple%20is%20a,May%20Ra%20be&lt;/ref&gt;.

Surrounding the courtyard were storerooms and cult chambers, and some sun temples (like Userkaf’s) even included large basins thought to collect sacrificial blood or perhaps used for symbolic purification rites &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Abu Gorab - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Gorab#:~:text=ImageStone%20Basins%20from%20the%20Solar,Temple%20of%20Nyuserre&lt;/ref&gt;. Ritual scenes decorating the sun temples show the king performing ceremonies like the '''sed-festival''' in the presence of Ra, underlining that the king’s jubilee and the sun’s rejuvenation were closely linked &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Abu Gorab - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Gorab#:~:text=In%20the%20covered%20corridor%2C%20on,the%20south%2C%20known%20as%20the&lt;/ref&gt;. In essence, the Sun Temples functioned as monumental stages for the pharaoh to interact with Ra: Pharaoh was the chief priest of the sun cult, personally presenting extravagant offerings to ensure Ma’at (cosmic order) and the continuance of the sun’s beneficence for Egypt.

Despite plans for as many as six or seven Sun Temples, this trend was short-lived &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Egyptian sun temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_sun_temple#:~:text=Heliopolis%20.,1%20%5D%20The&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Egyptian sun temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_sun_temple#:~:text=,order%20to%20reconstruct%20the%20shape&lt;/ref&gt;. Only two such temples have been uncovered (Userkaf’s and Niuserre’s), and they appear to have been '''abandoned after the Fifth Dynasty''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Egyptian sun temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_sun_temple#:~:text=,order%20to%20reconstruct%20the%20shape&lt;/ref&gt;. The cessation of Sun Temple construction is commonly attributed to religious and political shifts at the end of the Old Kingdom. By the reign of Djedkare Isesi (late 5th Dynasty), the cult of '''Osiris''' (god of the afterlife) was rising in prominence, appealing to broader society and appearing in royal funerary texts. Correspondingly, Djedkare and the last 5th-Dynasty king, Unas, chose not to build sun temples at all &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Sun Temples at Abu Gurob – The Curious Egyptologist--&gt;https://thecuriousegyptologist.com/2022/07/25/the-sun-temples-at-abu-gurob/#:~:text=But%20as%20the%205,17&lt;/ref&gt;. Unas even broke with tradition by omitting the name “Ra” from his kingly titles &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Sun Temples at Abu Gurob – The Curious Egyptologist--&gt;https://thecuriousegyptologist.com/2022/07/25/the-sun-temples-at-abu-gurob/#:~:text=But%20as%20the%205,17&lt;/ref&gt;, a striking indicator that the obsessive solar emphasis of his predecessors had waned. Additionally, Unas’s pyramid at Saqqara featured the first '''Pyramid Texts''' (many invoking Osiris and other gods), suggesting a theological shift where the afterlife cult of Osiris was eclipsing the state’s exclusive focus on Ra. It is also possible that economic and administrative factors played a role: the 5th Dynasty had poured resources into both pyramid complexes and sun temples each generation, straining state capacity. As central authority weakened toward the 6th Dynasty, maintaining the elaborate solar sanctuaries may have proven untenable. Notably, the royal cemetery itself moved from Abusir (near the sun temples) back to Saqqara under Djedkare, symbolically returning to tradition &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Sun Temples at Abu Gurob – The Curious Egyptologist--&gt;https://thecuriousegyptologist.com/2022/07/25/the-sun-temples-at-abu-gurob/#:~:text=But%20as%20the%205,17&lt;/ref&gt;. In summary, the Sun Temples represented a unique flowering of solar theology – materially grand but relatively transient. Their abrupt end likely reflects a changing balance in Egyptian religion: the timeless cult of myriad gods (and the need to fund the king’s own mortuary cult) reasserted itself over the exclusive royal Ra-cult. Not until Akhenaten’s time (over a millennium later) would Egypt see another attempt at a dedicated state solar cult on a comparably grand scale &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Egyptian sun temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_sun_temple#:~:text=pharaohs%20%20of%20the%20,2&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Amarna Period (c. 1353–1336 BCE) witnessed a dramatic upheaval in Egyptian religion led by Pharaoh '''Akhenaten''' (born Amenhotep IV). Akhenaten established a quasi-monotheistic worship of the '''Aten''', the solar disk, at the expense of all other gods. Early in his reign (Year 4 or 5), he changed his name from Amenhotep (“Amun is satisfied”) to *Akhenaten* (“Effective for Aten”) and initiated sweeping religious reforms &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Akhenaten, Nefertiti &amp; Aten: From Many Gods to One - ARCE--&gt;https://arce.org/resource/akhenaten-nefertiti-aten-many-gods-one/#:~:text=kind%20of%20early%20monotheism%C2%A0that%20stressed,knew%20the%20god%3A%20Akhenaten%20himself&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Akhenaten, Nefertiti &amp; Aten: From Many Gods to One - ARCE--&gt;https://arce.org/resource/akhenaten-nefertiti-aten-many-gods-one/#:~:text=from%20Amenhotep%20to%20Akhenaten%20%E2%80%93,affront%20to%20Egypt%E2%80%99s%20religious%20institutions&lt;/ref&gt;.

This iconography reinforced the idea that Aten’s life-giving power reached the people exclusively through the royal family.

'''Cultic structure under Atenism''' shifted radically from traditional models. Temples to Aten (such as those at the new capital Akhetaten, modern Amarna) were open to the sky, consistent with Aten being the physical sun. They lacked dark inner sanctuaries and cult statues – the Aten’s presence was the sunlight itself. Long offering tables in open courts replaced the intimate shrines of earlier gods. Worship was centered on the royal family venerating Aten: only Akhenaten (often accompanied by Queen '''Nefertiti''' and their daughters) performed offerings, while the populace likely participated by adoring the king and sun from afar. Akhenaten elevated himself as the '''sole intermediary''' with Aten: “there was only one god and only one person who now knew the god – Akhenaten himself” &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Akhenaten, Nefertiti &amp; Aten: From Many Gods to One - ARCE--&gt;https://arce.org/resource/akhenaten-nefertiti-aten-many-gods-one/#:~:text=kind%20of%20early%20monotheism%C2%A0that%20stressed,knew%20the%20god%3A%20Akhenaten%20himself&lt;/ref&gt;. This effectively made the pharaoh and his family the '''exclusive priests''' of Aten. Nefertiti in particular assumed an unprecedented role in ritual and art, shown nearly equal to the king in executing cultic acts. Royal women were given a '''special place''' in Atenism – Nefertiti (and by extension the princesses) formed, along with Akhenaten and Aten, a kind of '''divine triad''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Akhenaten, Nefertiti &amp; Aten: From Many Gods to One - ARCE--&gt;https://arce.org/resource/akhenaten-nefertiti-aten-many-gods-one/#:~:text=Another%20of%20the%20Karnak%20buildings,divine%20themselves&lt;/ref&gt;. In one inscription, Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and the Aten are likened to the creator god and the first divine pair (Atum spawning Shu and Tefnut) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Akhenaten, Nefertiti &amp; Aten: From Many Gods to One - ARCE--&gt;https://arce.org/resource/akhenaten-nefertiti-aten-many-gods-one/#:~:text=Another%20of%20the%20Karnak%20buildings,divine%20themselves&lt;/ref&gt;, implying Nefertiti was viewed as a goddess-like figure, essential for the cosmos (as Aten’s female counterpart). Thus, Atenist theology collapsed the distinction between divinity and royalty: Aten was the sole creator, Akhenaten was Aten’s earthly manifestation/prophet, and Nefertiti was a divine consort aiding in creation and sustaining life. Traditional gods – even Osiris in funerary belief – were officially discarded, though evidence from tombs suggests that many Egyptians privately clung to the old deities during this time &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Akhenaten, Nefertiti &amp; Aten: From Many Gods to One - ARCE--&gt;https://arce.org/resource/akhenaten-nefertiti-aten-many-gods-one/#:~:text=Photo%3A%20M&lt;/ref&gt;.

One of the most striking aspects of Akhenaten’s religious revolution was the accompanying '''artistic revolution'''. Art in the Amarna period broke sharply from centuries of stylized representation, adopting a peculiar new aesthetic that appeared more fluid and exaggerated. Colossal statues of Akhenaten from his early Karnak temples portray him with '''exaggerated, androgynous features''': an elongated alien-looking head, narrow slitted eyes and full lips, a slender torso with a protruding belly, broad hips, and spindly limbs &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Akhenaten, Nefertiti &amp; Aten: From Many Gods to One - ARCE--&gt;https://arce.org/resource/akhenaten-nefertiti-aten-many-gods-one/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20Karnak%20buildings,and%20prosperity%2C%20like%20the%20Aten&lt;/ref&gt;. Far from a flattering portrayal, this seemingly bizarre image was '''deliberately symbolic'''. Some scholars interpret it as Akhenaten embodying both male and female qualities – an allusion to the creator Aten who contains all life and fertility &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--21: Akhenaten and the Amarna Style - Ancient Art Podcast--&gt;https://www.ancientartpodcast.org/blog/21/#:~:text=Podcast%20www,singular%20being%20of%20idealized%20androgyny&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Art of the Amarna Period - World History Encyclopedia--&gt;https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1110/the-art-of-the-amarna-period/#:~:text=Encyclopedia%20www,in%20a%20similarly%20androgynous%20way&lt;/ref&gt;.

Artistic scenes also became intimate and naturalistic: the royal family is shown in informal poses, kissing their daughters or lounging under the sun’s rays, a radical departure from the formality of prior art &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Akhenaten: The Only Androgynous Pharaoh | DailyArt Magazine--&gt;https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/man-woman-or-both-meet-akhenaten-the-only-androgenous-pharaoh/#:~:text=Magazine%20www,dynasty%2C%20Aton%20temple%2C%20Amarna%2C&lt;/ref&gt;. This was propagandistic as well – emphasizing the '''Aten’s blessings on the royal household''' and the close, almost exclusive relationship between the god and the king’s family. 

Atenist art and inscriptions also carefully omitted traditional symbols: for example, the Aten’s rays end in little hands presenting *ankhs* directly to the noses of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, reinforcing that '''only through them''' does Aten grant life to Egypt &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Akhenaten, Nefertiti &amp; Aten: From Many Gods to One - ARCE--&gt;https://arce.org/resource/akhenaten-nefertiti-aten-many-gods-one/#:~:text=that%20of%20the%20Aten%20%E2%80%93,out%20to%20the%20royal%20family&lt;/ref&gt;. The names of other gods, especially Amun, were chiseled out nationwide (a task often done hastily &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Akhenaten, Nefertiti &amp; Aten: From Many Gods to One - ARCE--&gt;https://arce.org/resource/akhenaten-nefertiti-aten-many-gods-one/#:~:text=match%20at%20L119%20dispatched%20to,affront%20to%20Egypt%E2%80%99s%20religious%20institutions&lt;/ref&gt;), and even plural term “gods” was avoided. This religious purism was unprecedented. Akhenaten built an entirely new city, '''Akhetaten (Amarna)''', in Middle Egypt to be the center of Aten’s worship, removing the court from Thebes (with its powerful Amun clergy) and Memphis. At Amarna, massive open temples like the '''Great Aten Temple''' and the '''Small Aten Temple''' held festivals and daily rituals to Aten, with plentiful offerings laid out in sunlight. Meanwhile, the traditional funerary practices were altered: Akhenaten’s tomb and those of his courtiers invoke only the Aten’s grace and the king’s favor – Osiris and other afterlife gods are conspicuously absent. 

In analyzing Akhenaten’s '''atypical appearance''' and its symbolism, we see a convergence of the political and the religious. His distinctive portrayal – sometimes speculated to be due to a genetic disorder, though likely intentional – visually separated him from all previous kings and affirmed that *everything had changed*. Akhenaten’s form was alien but also '''universal''', blending genders and roles, which suited a king who claimed to be the sole conduit to an all-encompassing deity &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--21: Akhenaten and the Amarna Style - Ancient Art Podcast--&gt;https://www.ancientartpodcast.org/blog/21/#:~:text=Podcast%20www,singular%20being%20of%20idealized%20androgyny&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Art of the Amarna Period - World History Encyclopedia--&gt;https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1110/the-art-of-the-amarna-period/#:~:text=Encyclopedia%20www,in%20a%20similarly%20androgynous%20way&lt;/ref&gt;. In a sense, the artwork declared Akhenaten as '''both king and priest, mother and father''', encapsulating the Aten’s creative duality. Politically, this helped undermine the authority of entrenched priesthoods (especially Amun’s), as the king’s new persona and religion supplanted their traditional privileges. The presence of Nefertiti as an almost equal partner in imagery – sometimes shown wearing the kingly crown smiting enemies – might have been meant to double the divine presence on earth (two humans embodying Aten’s will instead of one) and perhaps to prepare for succession plans. 

Ultimately, Atenism was a state-imposed revolution in cult that did not long survive Akhenaten’s reign. Nevertheless, it remains extraordinary for its bold '''ideological departure''': a focus on a singular intangible god, the sun’s disk, and the elevation of the royal family to near-divine status as the '''only worshippers who mattered'''. The material legacy at Amarna – unique art, new temple forms, and extensive records like the Amarna letters – gives us a detailed if selective window into how Akhenaten’s cult was practiced and perceived.

=== Restoration of Traditional Religion after Akhenaten: Resistance and Revival===

Akhenaten’s religious experiment was largely reversed in the years following his death. There is evidence that even during the Amarna period, many Egyptians resisted the complete abandonment of traditional gods (for example, later excavations at Amarna found hidden '''figurines of deities''' and coffins decorated with '''images of Osiris''' and other gods, suggesting private devotion continued despite the official creed &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Akhenaten, Nefertiti &amp; Aten: From Many Gods to One - ARCE--&gt;https://arce.org/resource/akhenaten-nefertiti-aten-many-gods-one/#:~:text=match%20at%20L174%20yielded%20coffins,king%20in%20abandoning%20the%20gods&lt;/ref&gt;). After Akhenaten’s 17-year reign, his successors moved quickly to restore the old order. The young King '''Tutankhaten''' – likely Akhenaten’s son – was installed on the throne, and under the guidance of powerful officials (vizier Ay and General Horemheb) he reinstated the worship of Amun and the pantheon. Tutankhaten changed his name to '''Tutankhamun''', signalling the return of Amun’s favor &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Tutankhamun - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun#:~:text=married%20his%20presumed%20half,also%20moved%20the%20royal%20court&lt;/ref&gt;. In his '''Restoration Stela''', erected early in his reign, Tutankhamun announced the reopening of all the temples, the reestablishment of the traditional cults, and the repatriation of the gods’ images to their shrines &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Tutankhamun - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun#:~:text=married%20his%20presumed%20half,He%20reestablished&lt;/ref&gt;. He describes how “the temples of the gods and goddesses were in ruins” and that he '''restored the sanctuaries''', '''reinstated the festivals''', and '''endowed the priesthoods''' that had been neglected under Atenism &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Tutankhamun - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun#:~:text=married%20his%20presumed%20half,He%20reestablished&lt;/ref&gt;. The cult of Amun in particular was given preeminence again – Tutankhamun’s stele speaks of '''renewing the offerings of Amun''' and others, and of the gods hearing prayers once more. The royal court abandoned Amarna and returned to Memphis and Thebes, traditional power centers &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Tutankhamun - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun#:~:text=restorations%20of%20cults%20were%20recorded,The%20young%20king%20likely%20began&lt;/ref&gt;. In effect, Tutankhamun (who was only a child) and his advisors pursued a policy of deliberate '''archaism''': reviving titles, art styles, and rituals from before Akhenaten, as if to erase the Amarna aberration. 

This restoration faced little recorded opposition – indeed, it may have been welcomed by a populace weary of the disruption. The priests of Amun, Thoth, Ptah, Osiris and other clergy who had been sidelined were reappointed to their stations. To mend the cosmic rift, Tutankhamun’s restoration decrees emphasized that '''Maat''' (divine order) was being reestablished. For example, the young king proclaimed that the '''triad of state gods''' Amun, Ptah, and Ra-Horakhty were to be worshipped again as *one*, harmoniously guiding Egypt &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://arce.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kawai-Transcript-.pdf#:~:text=and%20Aten%20simultaneously%20at%20the,Amarna%20after%20his%20accession%2C%20because&lt;/ref&gt;. This perhaps was an attempt to integrate Atenism’s lesson of a unified theology without excluding the traditional deities – in other words, promote a kind of inclusive henotheism with Amun-Ra and Ptah at the apex. Economically, temple lands and privileges that had been confiscated were restored: “the wealth of Egypt was once again redistributed to the temples and nobles” and the '''temples thrived''', regaining their status as major landholders &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://arce.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kawai-Transcript-.pdf#:~:text=and%20Aten%20simultaneously%20at%20the,Amarna%20after%20his%20accession%2C%20because&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Behind the scenes, the real architect of the restoration was likely '''Horemheb''', the army general who served as regent. Evidence suggests Horemheb and perhaps Ay orchestrated Tutankhamun’s edicts (Horemheb later even '''usurped Tutankhamun’s Restoration Stela''', carving his own name over it once he became pharaoh) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://arce.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kawai-Transcript-.pdf#:~:text=Ironically%2C%20the%20inscription%20was%20usurped,he%20had%20actually%20restored%20the&lt;/ref&gt;. As later king, Horemheb continued and intensified the backlash against Atenism. He initiated a thorough '''damnatio memoriae''' of Akhenaten and his immediate family: official king lists omitted the Amarna rulers entirely, and their monuments were torn down or dismantled for scrap. Horemheb “aimed to remove the memory of the Amarna kings in order to legitimize himself as a new king” &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://arce.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kawai-Transcript-.pdf#:~:text=Tutankhamun,family%20of%20the%2018th%20dynasty&lt;/ref&gt; – since he had no royal blood, presenting Akhenaten’s reign as a heretical interlude and himself as the restorer of divine order was politically expedient. He demolished Aten temples (for instance, the Aten temple at Karnak was destroyed and its blocks reused in the foundations of the 2nd and 9th pylons) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://arce.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kawai-Transcript-.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L197%20temple%20was,between%20the%20main%20temple%20and&lt;/ref&gt;. The name “Aten” itself was excised or downgraded, and '''Amun’s name and images were re-carved''' where they had been removed. Horemheb also likely reallocated the excessive wealth that had accumulated in the Aten’s domain back to the traditional temples. In an inscription on a statue, Horemheb claims to have “restored the temple of Amun at Karnak and magnified Thebes from its devastated state without mentioning Tutankhamun” – effectively taking credit for the entire restoration process &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://arce.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kawai-Transcript-.pdf#:~:text=Ironically%2C%20the%20inscription%20was%20usurped,he%20had%20actually%20restored%20the&lt;/ref&gt;.

Because Akhenaten’s reforms had been so far-reaching, the restoration took place on multiple levels: theological, economic, and artistic. '''Theological:''' the pluralism of gods was reinstated, and no attempt was made again (in pharaonic times) to abolish Egypt’s multitude of cults. '''Economic:''' temple estates and priestly privileges were reaffirmed; Horemheb went further by issuing decrees to curb abuses and corruption that had grown during the instability (his Great Edict). '''Artistic:''' the traditional conventions returned – for example, under Tutankhamun and Horemheb, artisans reverted to depicting the king with idealized youthful features and the gods in their familiar forms. We also see deliberate efforts to incorporate elements from the glory days of the 18th Dynasty pre-Amarna (for instance, Tutankhamun’s imagery often harkened back to Amenhotep III). 

Significantly, the post-Amarna restoration was not simply a return to the past, but also a '''preventative reaction'''. The royal and priestly establishment took steps to ensure such heresy would not recur. Later kings of the 19th Dynasty, like Seti I and Ramesses II, continually emphasized their pious service to *all* the gods and completed the erasure of Amarna names. Akhenaten was vilified as “the enemy” or “that criminal” in later records. The speed and thoroughness of the restoration indicate that Akhenaten’s cult had never deeply penetrated the populace at large, and traditional Egyptian religion – with its deeply rooted local devotions and rituals tied to daily life – quickly '''reasserted itself'''. Thus, through a combination of popular resilience, priestly pressure, and state policy, Egypt’s millennia-old religious framework was reestablished within a few years of Akhenaten’s demise &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Tutankhamun - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun#:~:text=married%20his%20presumed%20half,He%20reestablished&lt;/ref&gt;. The '''cultic infrastructure''' (temples, priesthoods, festivals) was nursed back to health, and the collective memory of the Atenist episode was actively suppressed, allowing the continuity of Egyptian religion to proceed seemingly unbroken into the Ramesside era.

=== Gradual Decline of Ancient Egyptian Religion in Later Periods===

For the next thousand years after Amarna, Egyptian religion remained robust even under foreign rule, until the spread of new world religions in the Roman period. During the '''Late Period''' and '''Ptolemaic (Greco-Roman) era''' (c. 664 BCE – 1st centuries CE), native Egyptian cults continued to thrive and evolve. Many pharaohs of the Late Period, including foreign rulers like the Ptolemies, presented themselves as traditional Egyptian kings and invested in temple building – e.g. the Ptolemies constructed or refurbished magnificent temples (the Temple of Horus at Edfu, Temple of Isis at Philae, Temple of Hathor at Dendera) in authentic pharaonic style. At the same time, there was syncretism: Egyptian deities like Isis, Osiris, Horus, and Amun were identified with Greek and Roman gods, widening their appeal. The '''cult of Isis''' in particular spread beyond Egypt, becoming popular across the Mediterranean (Isis’s traits were adapted to Greek-Roman sensibilities, and her worshipers established shrines from Rome to London) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Decline of ancient Egyptian religion - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_ancient_Egyptian_religion#:~:text=The%20form%20that%20Isis%20took,Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;. Such diffusion shows the vitality of Egyptian religion even under foreign domination.

However, the '''gradual decline''' of the ancient cults set in as the Roman Empire adopted Christianity. Under Roman emperors, especially from the 4th century CE onward, pagan temples faced growing persecution and loss of state support &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Egyptian temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_temple#:~:text=Temple,famous%20tourist%20attractions%20that&lt;/ref&gt;. Edicts against pagan sacrifice and the withdrawal of temple incomes led to the closure of many shrines. By the '''4th–6th centuries AD''', the last hieroglyphic temples were shuttered – famously, the Temple of Isis at '''Philae''' in southern Egypt was one of the final holdouts, performing traditional rites until at least the late 5th century before being closed by imperial decree. With the '''coming of Christianity''', the once-state-sponsored temple cults “died out” as regular practice &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Egyptian temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_temple#:~:text=Temple,famous%20tourist%20attractions%20that&lt;/ref&gt;. Some temples were converted to churches; others were abandoned to the desert. The ancient priesthoods disappeared as the knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was lost and the economic base (landed estates) of the temples was confiscated. By the end of the 6th century, '''native Egyptian religion''' survived only in folk practices and hidden pockets, its monumental institutions largely fallen silent. 

In summary, Egyptian religion, which had evolved over 3,000 years through phases of vibrant development and occasional disruption, finally succumbed to a fundamental paradigm shift. The '''ideological and cultic continuity''' was broken not by an Akhenaten-like figure from within, but by external religious change in the form of Christianity (and later Islam). Yet, the material legacy – the grand temples, tombs, and countless artistic representations of gods and rites – endured and was rediscovered by later generations. These remains continue to testify to the rich cultic and ritual history of ancient Egypt: a civilization that, in its own words, sought to maintain *maat* (cosmic order) by honoring the gods of the land through an ever-evolving tapestry of '''cult, ideology, and architecture''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Egyptian temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_temple#:~:text=Temple,famous%20tourist%20attractions%20that&lt;/ref&gt;.

The phenomenon of god-worshipping is an ancient one. A concept much older than what is often called "religion".    

=== What Is a god? ===
There are many different ideas of what a god is. 

I am specifically using the word god without capitalization, because when capitalized it often implies a monotheistic deity, which is not my intent.  

The Japanese philosopher Motoori Norinaga puts the position to words better than I ever could, in his analysis of the Japanese word Kami (神), a word I translate as "god". {{quote|Generally speaking, "kami" denotes, in the first place, the deities of heaven and earth that appear in the ancient texts, as well as the spirits enshrined in the shrines. Furthermore, among all kinds of beings—including not only human beings but also such objects as birds, beasts, trees, grass, seas, mountains, and so forth—any being whatsoever which possesses some eminent quality out of the ordinary, and is awe-inspiring, is called kami.

(Eminence here does not refer simply to superiority in nobility, goodness, or merit. Evil or strange things, if they are extraordinarily awe-inspiring, are also called kami.)

Among things which are called kami, thunder is evidently included, since it is usually referred to as narukami or kaminari ("pealing kami"). Also included are such things as dragons, kotama, foxes, and so forth—beings which are eminently wonderful and awe-inspiring.

Kotama is what people today call tengu, and in Chinese writings it is referred to as a mountain goblin. In the Nihongi and the Man'yōshū, we see the tiger and the wolf, too, called kami. There are also cases in which peaches were given the divine name Okamuzumi no Mikoto, and a necklace was called Mikuratana no Kami. Furthermore, we often find cases in which rocks, stumps of trees, and leaves of plants spoke audibly—these too are kami.

Frequently, seas and mountains are called kami. It is not that the spirit of the sea or mountain is referred to as kami, but that the sea or the mountain itself is regarded as kami. This is because they are exceedingly awe-inspiring.

Thus, kami are manifold: some kami are noble, while others are lowly; some are strong, whereas others are weak; again, some kami are good, while others are evil. Corresponding to this variety, the will and acts of kami are also diverse. Therefore, we cannot speak of kami in definite terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gall|first1=Robert S.|title=Kami and Daimon: A Cross-Cultural Reflection on What Is Divine|journal=Philosophy East and West|date=January 1999|volume=49|issue=1|pages=63–74|doi=10.2307/1400117|jstor=1400117}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Translating kami as "god' is not entirely without controversy. I render ''kami'' as “god” because the English word already functions as a capacious suitcase that generations of translators have stuffed with everything from Aten and Zeus down to household lares, carved fetishes, and even the physical idols that house them; in other words, the term is habitually applied to precisely the same spectrum of awe‑inspiring, ritually addressed agents that Motoori describes. The fact that English speakers also reserve an uppercase “God” for a singular, omnipotent being does not disqualify the lowercase term from this broader usage—it simply reveals a monotheistic bias toward unity that I wish to keep visible rather than work around. By folding ''kami'' into “god” I highlight the essential commonality that motivates this book: across cultures, what matters is the act of directed veneration, not the entity’s metaphysical rank or doctrinal classification. Whether the being is a storm‑spirit, a saint’s relic, a talking mountain, or a “messenger” or “manifestation” of an otherwise unitary deity, English historically calls it a god when worship enters the picture—and that functional, relational sense is exactly what my argument needs.

In this book, I define a god as "that which is worshipped." This is consistent with the etymologies of words like ''theos'' (linked to festivals and divine appearances), ''god'' (from Germanic roots meaning "that which is called upon"), and especially ''yazata'' (an Avestan term meaning "worthy of worship").

I do not judge which gods are worthy of worship. That is not my role. I believe the gods I worship are worthy; others may disagree. Monotheists may claim only one yazata exists. Polytheists may recognize many. But the essential feature is directedness: worship is a transitive verb.

In English, worship is often used vaguely. For instance when people mention "'''Sunday worship'''", there's very little, if any, actual discussion of what is being worshipped there. Because in this context, the target of worship is already assumed to be Yahweh/Jesus. But in god-worshipping, the object must be named. The attention must be directed. 

The term "god" is sometimes rejected within certain traditions because of their own internal rules and theology. The word worship has some similar issues. And this is before the issues of people objecting to descriptions because they do not believe in a tradition.  

Few people are going to object to my description of Yahweh (יהוה‎) as a god. Nobody who understands Arabic will object to my description of Allah (الله) as a god. Although certainly some will, just because they read implications into using the Arabic word, used by Muslims, Christians, and Jews alike. 

No Christians will object to my description of Jesus as a god. But it might raise eyebrows if I called the Holy Spirit a god. In Shinto '''Amaterasu Ōmikami''' (天照大御神) is a god. If I described the Virgin Mary as a god, people will object. In Catholicism there are four words that I would translate as worship: Latria, Hyperdulia, Protodulia, and Dulia in descending order of precedence. Reserved for the Trinity, the Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph, and other Saints respectively.&lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c594/7efc6bd15004bac4e5ecb454d1784724f654.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While an interesting distinction, I see no reason to make this distinction in a general theory of god-worshipping, and I will categorize them all as god-worshipping. Likewise in a Japanese context if I called Shakyamuni, better known as "The Buddha" in the Western world a god, that will also raise eyebrows. And the same with Fudō Myōō (不動明王). This is because of internal Buddhist terminology distinctions that aren't relevant to this account.

Mary is a god. Fudō Myōō (不動明王) is a god. Dainichi Nyorai (大日如来) is a god. George Washington is a god. And Donald Trump is unfortunately a god. Gods vary in status, but the act of worship is what defines them.

=== The Stages of god-Worshipping ===

I am a ritual-first theorist. I do not believe myth comes first. I believe god-worshipping begins in four (sometimes five) stages:

# '''Animatism''': A background sense that the world is filled with forces, intentions, and meanings. This is not yet god-worship. It is the fertile soil from which it grows.
# '''Recognition''': A particular person has an experience—a striking encounter with a place, a being, an event. They detect agency. They feel awe. This is sometimes described in cognitive science as a "hyperactive agency detection device" (HADD). But it is not a bug. It is a feature.
# '''Ritual Relationship''': The person begins to act differently toward this thing. They visit the tree. They talk to the mountain. They give offerings to a rock. These rituals are meaningful because they express and shape the relationship.
# '''Mythic Codification''': Stories develop. Some are based on real events. Some are exaggerated memories. Some are invented. But they all help frame the relationship in shared, communicable terms.
# '''Exaptation and Survival''': If the original conditions change, the cult may collapse. But sometimes it adapts. A meme, story, or symbol gets repurposed in a new setting. This is exaptation—the evolutionary reuse of a structure for a new function.

A successful god-worshipping lineage can return from Stage 5 to Stage 3. This is what I see in enduring traditions like Ise, Izumo, and the cult of Mary. While there are clear elements of this in some of the even larger faiths like Christianity and Islam, I am hesitant to describe them this way, because these large monotheistic traditions work through overcoding.
=== Archetypes, Symbols, and the Limits of Jung ===

God-worshipping uses symbols. It may involve archetypes. But gods are not just symbols or archetypes. They are not solipsistic projections of the psyche.

Jung's theory of archetypes has had a profound influence on how many modern spiritual thinkers understand gods, especially within neopaganism and New Age movements. However, this influence has often been filtered through a distorted lens, most notably popularized by figures like Jordan Peterson. In this misreading, archetypes become rigid psychological constants—idealized templates that structure the psyche and should be revered as if they were gods themselves.

But even Jung himself was ambivalent. He saw archetypes as deeply ingrained psychic structures, yes—but not always as liberating. In fact, Jung sometimes treated them as imprisoning forces—inescapable filters that shape perception and limit autonomy. From this perspective, archetypes are not pantheons; they are prisons. They are not the gods themselves, but patterns in which gods are often perceived.

To reduce gods to archetypes is to mistake the medium for the message, the echo for the voice. Archetypes are symbolic language used by the psyche to interpret divine presence, but the divine itself is not exhausted by this interpretation. If one worships an archetype alone, one risks worshipping one's own mental furniture.

This leads to a kind of spiritual solipsism. If all gods are only aspects of the self, then the world becomes flat—nothing but mirrors. God-worshipping, in contrast, is about stepping beyond the self. It is a practice of wonder, humility, and relation.

=== A Better Ontology ===

Instead of reducing gods to psychological archetypes, we can approach them through alternative ontological frameworks.

One option is object-oriented ontology (OOO), which views all entities—humans, trees, gods, electrons—as equally real and equally withdrawn. In this view, a god is a real being that does not fully reveal itself to us, that resists total access or representation. This mirrors the experience many people have in ritual: the sense that the divine is there, but never fully captured.

Another option is the metaphysics of the Avataṃsaka Sūtra, a foundational Mahāyāna Buddhist text. In it, the universe is described as an interpenetrating network of infinite, radiant entities. Every phenomenon reflects and enfolds every other. Gods, in this framework, are not external rulers or mere mental constructs—they are nodes in the vast, luminous net of being. They are not "out there" or "in here"—they are relational, embedded, emergent.

Both frameworks emphasize that gods are real, but not reducible. They are not symbols in a book, or projections in a mind. They are presences that make claims on us.

And yet—you, reader, are also a god. Not a god because you are perfect or powerful, but because you are worthy of love, attention, and even worship. To read this book in earnest is already to participate in something sacred. If you send me an email, I will pray to you.

=== Evolutionary Benefits and Origins ===

God-worshipping is not a relic of the past—it evolved because it works. It encourages epistemic humility, sustained curiosity, and social bonding. It allows people to enter flow states, enhance attention, and synchronize with others through ritual. It fosters communitas—a shared sense of meaning that transcends individual roles.

== Toward a Celestial Anthropology ==
Many evolutionary theorists and materialists approach god-worship with a chthonic worldview: humans as reactive, preprogrammed, and mindless actors within nature. I prefer a '''celestial worldview''': humans as intelligent, meaning-making, aspirational creatures whose behaviors emerge from curiosity and wonder.

In Erich Fromm’s terms, the '''having mode''' wants to possess knowledge. The '''being mode''' wants to relate to the world in openness. god-worshipping comes from the being mode. It does not ask, "What can I get from this god?" but "What can I learn? What can I love?"

This is why god-worshipping evolved. It fosters epistemic humility. It promotes attention. It builds communitas. It is useful in almost every domain of human behavior.

Cultural appropriation, in its worst form, is capitalist decoding: stripping a sacred practice of its meaning. But faithful god-worshipping—even across cultures—is an act of recoding. It is rebellion. It is life.

Let there be 8 million gods, for there are 8 million ways to love the world.

----

*

==== 4. Victor Turner ====

* ''View:'' Ritual produces liminality and communitas—moments of collective transformation.
* ''Your Take:'' Strong influence. Your vision of revolution as sacred ritual draws from Turner. Worship is a space of reconstruction and communitas, not control or repression.

==== 5. Mircea Eliade ====

* ''View:'' The sacred ruptures profane time and space. Myths and rituals return us to sacred origins.
* ''Your Take:'' You value his phenomenology of the sacred, but go beyond it. Eliade describes well, but doesn't reconstruct. You want gods that '''act''', not myths that '''replay'''.

==== 6. Daniel Dennett ====

* ''View:'' Religion is a product of cognitive evolution—useful once, now mostly vestigial. Should be studied scientifically.
* ''Your Take:'' A soft anti-theist. His curiosity is useful, but his vision is sterile. He explains ritual functionally but ignores its ''spiritual power'' and ''desire''.

==== 7. Richard Dawkins ====

* ''View:'' Religion is a harmful meme complex. god belief is irrational and dangerous.
* ''Your Take:'' A tragic figure. He discovered memes and then recoiled. His rejection of religious meaning is rooted in fear that ''atheism itself might be a mind-virus''.

==== 8. John Vervaeke ====

* ''View:'' Religion is an ecology of practices that train relevance realization. Meaning is enacted through participation, not belief.
* ''Your Take:'' Personally influential. He opened doors, but doesn’t go far enough. You part ways where he avoids gods and worship, preferring abstract “meaning.”

== Introduction to Alpha ==

In this section of the book, I am going to be talking mostly about gods. I specifically am not going to use the term "religion" at any point during this section. I apologize, especially if you are reading an edition of this book that is not in English, as this may translate poorly. I am going to be avoiding the word religion throughout this entire section. This is a very intentional choice on my part, because I see religion as a problematic concept that is used very inconsistently and generally originates from political contexts.

Religion, as a concept, comes from the application of Christian categories—particularly those forged during the Catholic-Protestant conflict—onto the rest of the world. It is not a useful analytical tool here. While I will use the word "religion" frequently in later parts of this book, I will only do so in quotation marks and as a rhetorical necessity, not as a coherent category.

Abandoning the term "religion" makes this section more difficult to write. If I used it, I could easily refer to many topics—prophets, rituals, divinities—with the expectation that the reader would fill in the blanks with their own understandings. But that is precisely the problem: those understandings differ. The fluency of using the word masks the hard philosophical questions beneath. When someone hears that "Zarathustra founded the religion of Zoroastrianism," they might imagine a preacher gathering followers, a prophet writing scripture, a madman, or even a deal with the devil. It's a statement overloaded with projection.

Instead, I will say that Zarathustra founded Zoroastrianism. That is enough. The rest will be explored in due time.

As a polytheist, I will be expressing what may seem to some readers to be a surprisingly positive view of monotheistic traditions. And yes, I am calling them traditions, not religions. I will not use the term religion in this section for Christianity, Judaism, or any other tradition. This is not a dismissal of them—it is an effort to escape a flawed framework.

Words like "dharma" (Hindi), "deen" (Arabic), "religio" (Latin), and especially "shūkyō" (Japanese) are often translated as religion, but they do not share a common meaning. "Shūkyō" in particular is a modern term. It was not traditionally used in Japanese but was coined in the 19th century to satisfy treaty obligations with Western powers. Before this, Japan had no general word for "religion"—and arguably no need for one.

Many pagans—by which I mean modern pagans, not ancient ones—are angry at Christianity, and many are also angry at Judaism, although often in a more oblique or repressed way. There is a popular narrative among some pagans that Christianity violently destroyed the polytheistic traditions of the West, and that Judaism either seeded or enabled that destruction. Progressive pagans sometimes respond by reinterpreting Judaism as not truly monotheistic or as benignly non-proselytizing, but I think this is often politically motivated. It is socially unacceptable in progressive circles to attack Judaism, due to its associations with Nazi persecution, and so criticism is deflected or subdued. Yet modern paganism is a modern identity; it has more in common with modern Christianity than with ancient polytheism.

The so-called paganism of Homer is vastly different from the late paganism of Julian the Apostate. The Christianity of Constantine is likewise extremely different from that of Martin Luther—or of a present-day Christian. In fact, the Christianity of Constantine has more in common with the paganism of Julian than either does with their imagined forebears. That’s the tragedy. Christianity did not simply take over the Roman Empire—it absorbed and restructured a failing paganism. The real culprits in the fall of Roman polytheism were not Christians, but pagans themselves.

If your model of pagan revival is Julian or Plotinus or Iamblichus, you're already halfway down the road to Christianity. And that’s fine—if you understand what you’re doing. But it’s important to admit.

In this book, I am going to tell six stories. Each story is about how one civilization came into confrontation with monotheism—some survived, some didn't. While these cultures were in contact with one another, I will treat their transitions primarily as internal developments.

# Egypt and Atenism
# Israel and Judaism
# Persia and Zoroastrianism
# Rome and Christianity
# China and Buddhism
# Japan and Shinto

Egypt resisted the total loss of its gods, delaying it for millennia. China and Japan are, in my view, rare success stories—civilizations that managed to integrate external religious forces while preserving their native polytheism. Other regions—like the Americas, the Philippines, and even parts of Europe—lost their gods more violently, through conquest and forced conversion.

These six case studies are not the only ones that matter. But they are the ones I know best. And they will help illustrate what god-worshipping is, how it emerges, and how it survives.

== Version 3 ==


In this section, I avoid the term "religion" altogether. I do this because it is not a neutral word—it emerged in the European context, forged in the conflicts between Catholicism and Protestantism, and then exported globally under colonial and diplomatic pressures. For example, the Japanese word for religion, "shūkyo" (宗教), is a modern compound created during treaty negotiations with the United States and had no fixed meaning beforehand. Similarly, Arabic ''dīn'', Sanskrit ''dharma'', Latin ''religio'', and other words often translated as "religion" were historically deployed in far more specific or culturally contingent ways.

By refusing the word "religion" here, I am not trying to make things difficult. On the contrary, I want to make things clear. If I were to use the word, we could easily fall into familiar patterns of assumption, interpretation, and dismissal. Readers could slot ideas into preexisting categories without really listening. What I want instead is reflection, wonder, and openness.

For example, saying that "Zarathustra founded the religion of Zoroastrianism" suggests an entire framework of beliefs, institutions, and criteria. But simply saying "Zarathustra founded Zoroastrianism" focuses attention on the event and the person without invoking that entire semantic system. The former statement invites projection; the latter invites inquiry.

This is especially important because many modern pagans or polytheists define themselves in contrast to Christianity or Judaism. Some are overtly hostile to Christianity for its role in dismantling Greco-Roman or European indigenous systems. Some are ambivalent or idealize Judaism. But the truth is more complex. The paganism of Julian the Apostate was already vastly different from the polytheism of Homer. And the Christianity of Constantine was far closer to Julian's religion than it was to Martin Luther's, just as modern Christians and pagans often have more in common with each other than with their supposed ideological ancestors.

I do not see Christianity as something that "defeated" paganism. I see paganism as having already weakened itself. The problem, then, is not simply Christianity, but a broader shift in how gods were seen, honored, and remembered.

The six stories that I tell in this book—Egypt (Atenism), Israel (Judaism), Persia (Zoroastrianism), Rome (Christianity), China (Buddhism), and Japan (Shinto)—represent different pathways that god-worship took. Some lost their gods. Others preserved them. Others transformed them.

This will explore how Japan sustained religious pluralism and resisted monotheistic overcoding, with emphasis on the institutional role of the Jingikan, integration with Buddhism, and ideological frameworks like Confucian ritual governance.

# Shinto’s Evolution and Religious Pluralism in Japan: Historical Development and Institutions

## Polytheistic Foundations in the Yayoi and Kofun Periods

Early Japanese religious practice was inherently '''polytheistic and local''' in character, laying a foundation for enduring pluralism. During the '''Yayoi period (c. 400 BCE–300 CE)''', agrarian communities conducted nature-centric rituals at sacred sites such as large rocks, waterfalls, and groves, inviting formless '''kami''' (spirits/deities) to descend into physical objects (＊yorishiro＊) like trees, stones, or even mountains &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=Many%20such%20sites%20were%20located,that%20their%20shiny%20surfaces%20or&lt;/ref&gt;.

Rituals were thus largely propitiatory: village chiefs led ceremonies to '''placate and beseech multiple kami''' for good harvests and community well-being. These chiefs often doubled as shamans or priests, blurring secular and sacred roles &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=humanity,religious%20symbols%20of%20power%20like&lt;/ref&gt;.  Crucially, there was no notion of one exclusive god; rather, '''many kami and ancestral spirits''' coexisted, each rooted in a specific locale or clan.

By the '''Kofun period (c. 300–700 CE)''', the reverence for ancestors and clan deities became more pronounced. Rulers and elite lineages constructed massive burial mounds (*kofun*) for deceased leaders, surrounded by clay figurines (*haniwa*) depicting warriors, servants, and houses – indicating a belief in an afterlife where ancestral spirits required sustenance and protection &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=down,the%20Great%20King%20took%20many&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=wives%2C%20there%20could%20be%20many,far%20from%20the%20center%20of&lt;/ref&gt;. The imperial Yamato clan’s mythology, later recorded in the *Kojiki* (712) and *Nihon Shoki* (720), traced the emperor’s lineage to the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, elevating an '''ancestor-kami''' to a supreme position without denying the existence of myriad other kami &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto#:~:text=Although%20the%20narratives%20differ%20in,113&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto#:~:text=Shoki%20.,113&lt;/ref&gt;. As historian Kuroda Toshio notes, '''kami were originally local deities''' tied to clans or communities (often identified with ancestral spirits), which only later became linked to a wider imperial state concept &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=political%20significance,from%20the%20jingiryo%2C%20the%20government&lt;/ref&gt;. In short, Japan’s earliest religious strata featured '''multiple centers of devotion''' – nature spirits, clan tutelaries, and ancestral souls – fostering a '''resilient polytheistic outlook''' that would accommodate new religions rather than be replaced by them.

Importantly, even as the Yamato state expanded, it largely '''incorporated local cults''' rather than suppressing them. By the late Kofun era, the Yamato court began efforts to '''coordinate regional kami worship''' across its growing territory: for example, Emperor '''Keitai''' (r. 507–531) initiated a policy of dispatching court ritualists (the *Hioki-be* specialists) to provincial shrines to harmonize their rites with those of the capital &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=fell%20apart%20after%20his%20death,the%20Yamato%20purported%20to%20rule&lt;/ref&gt;. This early central patronage helped integrate diverse local rites into a loose network under imperial auspices. Yet, crucially, it did not extinguish the '''decentralized autonomy''' of local rituals – village and clan ceremonies continued as before, now just acknowledged and sometimes patronized by the court. The result by the end of the Kofun period was a nascent ritual hierarchy (with the Yamato sun cult at the apex) coexisting with persistent '''plural local traditions'''. This pattern – central coordination without outright religious unification – set the stage for Japan’s distinctive pluralism: even as more organized institutions emerged, they built upon a mosaic of '''many gods (八百万の神, *yaoyorozu no kami*, “eight million kami”)''' rather than enforcing a single orthodoxy.

## The Jingikan and Centralized Ritual Order in the Classical Era

In the early '''Classical period (7th–9th centuries)''', the Japanese state undertook a remarkable bureaucratic project to '''centralize and systematize religious rites''' – without abolishing the fundamental polytheism of kami worship. Under the '''Ritsuryō legal system''' imported from Tang China (first codified 701 CE), a government office called the '''Jingikan''' (神祇官, “Department/Council of Divinities”) was established. The Jingikan was one of two top state councils (the other being the Dajōkan or Council of State) and was theoretically supreme in rank &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=710%E2%80%93%C3%A2%E2%80%A2%E2%80%B0794,Although&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=the%20Jingikan%20was%20theoretically%20superior%2C,tenjin%2C%20amatsukami%29%20meant&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Jingikan thus provided a framework for a '''state-wide ritual order''' centered on the emperor’s court.

At the same time, the '''decentralized shrine network''' remained intact under this system. The Jingikan did not usurp local priestly lineages or enforce doctrinal uniformity; rather, it supervised and coordinated. For example, the *Engishiki* (927 CE), a compendium of regulations and ritual protocols, enumerated thousands of local shrines eligible for imperial offerings, implicitly recognizing the '''proliferation of sacred sites and kami cults''' across the provinces. Each shrine maintained its own traditions and '''hereditary priests (神官, *shinkan*)''', while the Jingikan set standards and courtiers ritually affirmed the hierarchy by sending offerings &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=fell%20apart%20after%20his%20death,the%20Yamato%20purported%20to%20rule&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=beginning%20in%20the%20sixth%20century,of%20this%20territory%20is%20recounted&lt;/ref&gt;.

This meant it functioned less as an independent “church” and more as a state ministry ensuring that '''no kami were neglected in official rites'''.

The establishment of the Jingikan marked a new level of '''institutional integration''' for Shinto (even though the term *“Shinto”* itself was not yet in common use for an independent religion). It allowed the Yamato house to '''legitimize its rule via divine sanction''' – the emperor was now the pivot of both government and worship, performing grand ceremonies (like the thanksgiving '''Niiname''' harvest rite) as a kind of priest-king. The classical chronicles record emperors consulting oracles and dedicating state resources to shrines, which reflects this fused model of sacral kingship &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=stretching%20to%20those%20boundaries,court%2C%20and%20led%20armies%20in&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=Political%20Struggle%20Casts%20the%C2%A0Kami%20as%C2%A0%E2%80%9CIndigenous%E2%80%9D,of%20which%20kind%20of%20Kami%E2%80%94the&lt;/ref&gt;.

In this sense, an '''ideological centralization''' occurred: the Sun Goddess myth and the Jingikan system together projected an image of a '''unified ritual order''' under imperial auspices.

Yet this centralization did '''not eliminate religious pluralism'''; rather, it managed it. The autonomy of local shrines was largely preserved – the state’s role was to patronize and regulate, not to homogenize spiritual practice. By the mid-Heian period (10th–11th centuries), the limitations of central control became evident: the Jingikan’s '''ability to supervise distant shrines waned markedly''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto during the Middle and Late Heian Period, Tenth through Twelfth Centuries | Shinto | Oxford Academic--&gt;https://academic.oup.com/book/6981/chapter/151273582#:~:text=The%20Jingikan%E2%80%99s%20ability%20to%20coordinate,changed%20to%20accommodate%20new%20deities&lt;/ref&gt;.

Emperors and aristocrats began developing '''private or court-specific cults''' (such as personal patronage of certain shrines), expanding the ritual calendar with new ceremonies (e.g. rites to pacify '''vengeful spirits''' of the war dead, or *goryō-e*) that were outside the old Jingiryō prescriptions &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto during the Middle and Late Heian Period, Tenth through Twelfth Centuries | Shinto | Oxford Academic--&gt;https://academic.oup.com/book/6981/chapter/151273582#:~:text=The%20Jingikan%E2%80%99s%20ability%20to%20coordinate,changed%20to%20accommodate%20new%20deities&lt;/ref&gt;.

This demonstrates a key theme: even with a central department of religion, Japan maintained a '''plural and flexible religious landscape'''. Unlike a theocracy imposing one dogma, the classical state cultivated a broad umbrella of rites – '''imperial Shinto – under which myriad local cults coexisted'''. As Hardacre notes, '''Shinto’s institutional identity''' coalesced around the Jingikan and court rites, but it never became an exclusive state church in the Western sense &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto#:~:text=Hardacre%20saw%20the%20Jingikan%20as,8&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=There%20is%20one%20further%20thing,extracting%20samples%20dealing%20only%20with&lt;/ref&gt;. Indeed, the very '''absence of a singular orthodoxy''' at this stage helped Shinto institutions endure alongside incoming faiths, rather than being subsumed by them.

## Buddhist–Shintō Syncretism (神仏習合): Honji Suijaku and Pluralism without Orthodoxy

One of the most distinctive features of Japanese religious history is the '''syncretism of Buddhism and Shintō''', known as *Shinbutsu-shūgō* (神仏習合, “kami–Buddha fusion). After Buddhism entered Japan in the 6th century, it did not displace the worship of kami; instead, over centuries, the two systems became deeply intertwined. By the '''Heian period (8th–12th centuries)''', Japanese thought had developed the doctrine of '''本地垂迹 (*honji suijaku*)''', literally “original ground and manifest trace.” This doctrine held that the '''Buddhas and bodhisattvas''' of Buddhism are the ultimate reality (the *honji*, “original ground”), while the '''kami''' are merely their local manifestations (*suijaku*, “traces”) appearing in Japan &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=themselves%20are%20trapped%20in%20this,the%20pure%20spirits%20of%20the&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=kami%20are%20benevolent%20deities%20who,Buddhist%20syncretization%20covered%20the%20late&lt;/ref&gt;. In practice, this meant every major kami could be understood as an avatar of a Buddha or bodhisattva – for example, the sun goddess Amaterasu was linked to Dainichi (the cosmic Buddha), and the storm god Susanoo linked to a Buddhist deity. Far from producing religious conflict, this idea facilitated '''Buddhist-Shintō unity''': rather than choosing one faith over the other, people saw them as *two levels of a single truth*. 

From roughly the late 8th through 11th centuries, '''kami veneration was increasingly absorbed into the Buddhist worldview''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=one%20another%20%28shinbutsu%20shfig6%29,the%20pure%20spirits%20of%20the&lt;/ref&gt;. Japanese Buddhist monks and scholars articulated several explanations to integrate the myriad native gods: 

- '''Kami as Buddhist seekers:''' Some taught that the kami themselves, realizing they were trapped in the cycle of rebirth (*samsara*), sought salvation through the Buddha’s law &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=innovations%20and%20new%20religious%20forms,a&lt;/ref&gt;.  
- '''Kami as protectors of Buddhism:''' Another view held that the kami were benevolent guardians who '''defend the Buddhist Dharma''', accepting their role in service of the Buddha &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=themselves%20are%20trapped%20in%20this,a&lt;/ref&gt;.  
- '''Kami as emanations of Buddhas (honji suijaku):''' The most enduring doctrine asserted that each kami is a '''local manifestation''' of a particular Buddha or bodhisattva, sent to guide the Japanese – the *honji suijaku* theory &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=themselves%20are%20trapped%20in%20this,the%20pure%20spirits%20of%20the&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=kami%20are%20benevolent%20deities%20who,Buddhist%20syncretization%20covered%20the%20late&lt;/ref&gt;.  
- '''Kami as spirits of Buddhas (＊hongaku＊):''' In some esoteric interpretations, the kami were even seen as the pure, enlightened '''spirit essences of the Buddhas''', identical in their ultimate nature &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=themselves%20are%20trapped%20in%20this,a&lt;/ref&gt;.

Alongside these doctrines, '''new religious institutions''' embodied the fusion. Buddhist temples were built *adjacent to Shintō shrines*, creating combined complexes known as '''神宮寺 (*jingūji*, “shrine-temples”)'''. The first jingūji appeared by the late 7th century; by the Heian era many important shrines (Ise being a rare exception) had a temple attached, staffed by Buddhist monks who conducted rites in tandem with—or often in control of—the shrine &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=built%20a%20jing%C5%ABji%2C%20or%20shrine,from%20the%20seventh%20century%20and&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=miserable%C2%A0state,clerics%20rather%20easily%20dominated%20cult&lt;/ref&gt;. A famous example is the '''Usa Hachiman Shrine''', where by the 8th century the kami Hachiman was revered as a '''Bodhisattva''' and a temple stood on the shrine grounds. In many cases, the '''Buddhist clergy assumed the leadership''' at shrines, overseeing kami rituals through a Buddhist lens &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=built%20a%20jing%C5%ABji%2C%20or%20shrine,from%20the%20seventh%20century%20and&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L5055%20Records%20after,gaining%20control%20of%20shrines%20and&lt;/ref&gt;. Images of kami were even cast in Buddhist style or depicted in '''mandala''' form (e.g. the Sannō Shrine mandala of Hie shrine shows Shintō deities in Buddhist iconography). This syncretic environment was so pervasive that it became '''impossible to neatly separate “Shintō” from “Buddhism”''' in medieval Japan &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=combination%20shrine%20and%20temple,Examples%20of%20this&lt;/ref&gt;. Ritual and iconography blended: for instance, the kami Hachiman was classically portrayed as a Buddhist monk (*Sogyo Hachiman*), and shrine festivals incorporated Buddhist sutra-chanting, while temples enshrined kami as guardians &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=kami%20are%20benevolent%20deities%20who,Buddhist%20syncretization%20covered%20the%20late&lt;/ref&gt;. As a result, religious sites and practices were '''dual-faith by default''' – one and the same institution would have Shintō ceremonies and Buddhist liturgies, serving both kami and Buddhas.

Significantly, this syncretism meant Japan '''never experienced the rigid enforcement of an exclusive orthodoxy'''. There was no drive to declare one creed true and others false. On the contrary, the logic was '''inclusivist''': '''all deities could be accommodated''' in a single cosmology. We see this in the way medieval thinkers handled contradictions. If a kami seemed violent or unholy, it was explained as a '''manifestation of a wrathful Buddhist deity''' or as a '''deluded spirit in need of Buddhist enlightenment''', rather than as a rival god to be overthrown &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=innovations%20and%20new%20religious%20forms,a&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=of%20the%20kami,the%20broader%20scheme%20of%20Buddhism&lt;/ref&gt;. The upshot was that '''religious pluralism became doctrinally entrenched''' – Buddhism provided an expansive philosophical umbrella that '''validated the existence of countless local deities'''. Kuroda Toshio emphasizes that in this period, *“there was more of a sense that Shintō occupied a subordinate position and role within the broader scheme of Buddhism”* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=of%20the%20kami,the%20broader%20scheme%20of%20Buddhism&lt;/ref&gt;. In other words, kami worship did not exist as an independent, self-contained “religion” but as part of a '''combinatory religious system''' dominated by Buddhist theory. Shintō (understood as the way of the kami) had no separate scriptures or exclusive institutions of its own, and thus '''no separate dogma to enforce'''. 

This lack of a singular orthodoxy is exemplified by the absence of even a term strictly meaning “Shintō” for much of this time – the word *Shintō* (神道, “Way of the Gods”) was used in various senses but often simply meant Buddhist-observances-for-kami or the general divine aspect of Japan &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=of%20the%20kami,First%2C%20an%20old%20woman&lt;/ref&gt;. The fusion was so complete that it wasn’t obvious to people that there were two “religions” at all; they saw a continuum of practices addressing different spiritual needs. '''Shrine priests and Buddhist monks cooperated''': for instance, at the major shrine of Kasuga in Nara, the powerful Kōfukuji temple (of the Fujiwara clan) managed the shrine, and Kasuga’s kami were viewed as incarnations of Kōfukuji’s Buddhist deities &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=Earth%2C%E2%80%9D%20JJRS%2033%2C%20no,See%20Royall&lt;/ref&gt;. '''No one was forced to choose''' between attending a shrine or a temple – most individuals freely did both. This is a key contrast with cultures that adopted a universalist religion which demanded *exclusive* allegiance. In Japan, '''multiple religious loyalties were the norm''', not an aberration.

By the late medieval period (14th–16th centuries), some intellectuals (notably in the '''Yoshida Shintō''' school) began to push back, proposing that '''kami were the true originals and Buddhas their manifestations''' (an *inverted* honji suijaku), in an effort to elevate Shintō’s status &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Honji suijaku - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honji_suijaku#:~:text=During%20the%20late%20Kamakura%20period,the%20Inverted%20honji%20suijaku&lt;/ref&gt;. However, these ideas remained theoretical and did not disrupt the prevailing syncretism at the popular level. It was only in the '''Meiji Restoration of 1868''' that a sudden, state-imposed separation of Buddhism and Shintō (*shinbutsu bunri*) took place – an unprecedented attempt to '''disentangle the blended faiths''' after over a millennium of union &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=The%20Meiji%20separation%20of%20Shinto,for%20the%20first%20time%20the&lt;/ref&gt;. Notably, Kuroda argues that this Meiji-era policy (and the associated brief persecution of Buddhism, *haibutsu kishaku*) was essentially the moment Shintō *“achieved for the first time the status of an independent religion”* – albeit artificially, by government fiat &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=The%20Meiji%20separation%20of%20Shinto,have%20yielded%20to%20this%20use&lt;/ref&gt;. In other words, prior to modern reforms, Japan had resisted creating a standalone, exclusivist state religion. Instead, its religious institutions evolved in '''pluralistic tandem''', with Buddhism and kami-worship *intertwined* rather than competing. This long syncretic experience meant that '''universalist or monotheistic “overcoding” never gained a foothold''': any external religion (like Buddhism, and later Christianity) had to coexist with the entrenched kami cult, which itself proved remarkably adaptable. The result was a deeply plural religious culture in which '''“mixing” was the rule''' – a stark contrast to regions where one religion supplanted all others.

## Confucian Influence and Ritual Governance in Heian and Edo Periods

Beyond Buddhism, '''Confucianism''' was the third major component of the Japanese religious matrix, especially influencing ideas of governance and social order. Confucian thought – with its emphasis on ritual propriety (礼, *rei*), filial piety, and moral hierarchy – entered Japan alongside other aspects of Chinese civilization. By the '''Heian period (794–1185)''', Confucian ideals had been incorporated into court politics and education. For instance, Japan’s early legal codes and imperial edicts show a Confucian imprint: Prince Shōtoku’s 7th-century “Seventeen-Article Constitution” famously enjoined officials to *“sincerely revere the Three Treasures [Buddhism]”* in one article, but elsewhere it stressed '''harmonious rule and ethical behavior''' in line with Confucian virtues &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=other%20scholars%20have%20disputed%20the,Legal%20codes%20issued&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=this%20document%C2%A0reads%3A%20Sincerely%20revere%20the,Under%20Suiko%20and&lt;/ref&gt;. The '''ritsuryō state''' itself was built on Chinese models that presumed a Confucian cosmological order. As Kuroda notes, the Jingiryō (kami law) section of the Ritsuryō code existed parallel to (and just before) the '''Sōniryō (Monastic Law)''' section governing Buddhist clergy – implying that the state saw '''kami rites and Buddhist institutions as distinct but complementary''' spheres &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=kami%20were%20popular%20local%20deities,a%20special%20influence%20on%20society&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=jingiryd%20in%20the%20ritsuryd%2C%20the,the%20Empress%20Shdtoku%2C%20in%20collusion&lt;/ref&gt;. This separation in law between kami ceremonies and “doctrinal” religions like Buddhism reflects a Confucian-influenced logic: the kami rites were part of '''state ritual (祭祀)''' and social obligation, whereas Buddhism was a matter of personal belief and higher teachings &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=kami%20were%20popular%20local%20deities,a%20special%20influence%20on%20society&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=sdniryd%20separately%20from%20the%20jingiryo%2C,collusion%20with%20the%20priest%20Ddkyd&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, already in the classical era, one can see an anticipation of the later idea that Shintō was about '''ritual and custom''' more than doctrine – a notion compatible with Confucian views of religion as civic rites upholding the social order.

During the '''Heian period''', Confucianism worked mostly in the background as a *political philosophy and ethical guide*. Court scholars studied Chinese classics; emperors held ceremonies (such as the '''Enshrinement of Confucius''' at the State Academy) to honor learning. However, Confucianism did not become a mass religion – it had '''no priesthood or temples of its own''' (apart from a few Confucian shrines later). Instead, its influence was to '''sacralize governance''': the emperor was cast as a '''Mandate-of-Heaven style ruler''' who performed correct rites, and officials were idealized as upright Confucian gentlemen. This '''ritual ideology''' reinforced Shintō and Buddhist practices rather than replacing them. For example, the concept of '''天下 (*tenka*, “All Under Heaven”)''' and a harmonious cosmic order informed how court ceremonies (like seasonal festivals or ancestral rites) were conducted, ensuring they paralleled the Chinese ideal of '''Li (ritual propriety)'''. By the late Heian, some Shintō theologians (such as at Ise Shrine) were even interpreting Japan’s kami mythology in light of Confucian cosmology and ethics &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto and Confucianism | 國學院大學デジタルミュージアム--&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=8944#:~:text=nobles%20and%20kami%20%20priests,the%20teachings%20of%20Zhu%20Xi&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto and Confucianism | 國學院大學デジタルミュージアム--&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=8944#:~:text=%28jindaikan%29,on%20the%20Yijing%20by%20Song&lt;/ref&gt;. *Nihon Shoki* commentaries by scholars like Ichijō Kaneyoshi (15th c.) and *Ise Shintō* texts by Watarai priests drew on '''Neo-Confucian concepts''' (e.g. yin-yang theory and moral principles) to explain the workings of the kami &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto and Confucianism | 國學院大學デジタルミュージアム--&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=8944#:~:text=nobles%20and%20kami%20%20priests,the%20teachings%20of%20Zhu%20Xi&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto and Confucianism | 國學院大學デジタルミュージアム--&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=8944#:~:text=drew%20upon%20Song%20schools%20of,Confucian%20teachings%20very&lt;/ref&gt;.

It was in the '''Edo period (1600–1868)''', under the Tokugawa shogunate, that Confucianism rose to its peak influence as a '''state ideology'''. Tokugawa rulers, seeking stability after centuries of war, promoted '''Neo-Confucianism (especially the Zhu Xi school)''' as the official philosophy guiding government and society &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Japanese Religions | FSI--&gt;http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions#:~:text=not%20until%20the%20Edo%20or,saw%20the%20value%20of%20Confucian&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Japanese Religions | FSI--&gt;http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions#:~:text=Confucianism%20was%20known%20to%20the,Several%20teachers&lt;/ref&gt;. '''Confucian ethics''' – loyalty to one’s lord, filial piety in the family, respect for social harmony – were actively disseminated.

Importantly, the Tokugawa embraced Confucianism *alongside* existing religious practices. Rather than proclaiming an exclusive “Confucian religion,” they invoked it to bolster '''Buddhism and Shintō as instruments of governance''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Japanese Religions | FSI--&gt;http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions#:~:text=ideology%20of%20state%20and%20a,know%20as%20bushido%2C%20the%20way&lt;/ref&gt;. The government required every household to register with a Buddhist temple (the '''danka system''') mainly to root out Christians, effectively using Buddhism as a social registry, while supporting shrine rites as part of communal life. Tokugawa intellectuals often spoke of the '''unity of the Three Teachings (＊sankyō itchi＊)''' – Shintō, Buddhism, and Confucianism as fundamentally harmonious and complementary &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto and Confucianism | 國學院大學デジタルミュージアム--&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=8944#:~:text=relationship%20between%20Shint%C5%8D%20and%20Confucianism,Juka%20Shint%C5%8D&lt;/ref&gt;. A popular slogan was '''神儒仏三教一致 (*Shinju butsu sankyō itchi*)''', meaning “Shintō, Confucianism, and Buddhism [are] one.” In fact, early Edo Confucian scholars like '''Hayashi Razan''' and '''Yamazaki Ansai''' developed what was called '''“Confucian Shintō” (儒家神道, *Juka Shintō*)''', asserting that Shintō’s ethical teachings were basically the same as Confucian morality, and that the ancient kami worship embodied Confucian principles of loyalty and filial piety &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto and Confucianism | 國學院大學デジタルミュージアム--&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=8944#:~:text=relationship%20between%20Shint%C5%8D%20and%20Confucianism,Juka%20Shint%C5%8D&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto and Confucianism | 國學院大學デジタルミュージアム--&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=8944#:~:text=onwards,Juka%20Shint%C5%8D&lt;/ref&gt;. They even reinterpreted Shintō texts through a Neo-Confucian lens, showing the flexibility of Shintō ideology to absorb foreign philosophies.

During the Edo era, therefore, '''Confucianism shaped Japanese religious life in a broad sense''' – by providing a '''moral and rational discourse''' that framed how people understood their obligations to family, lord, and community. It reinforced '''ritual order''' (e.g. emphasis on ancestral rites, which resonated with both Shintō and Buddhist practices) and gave the samurai governing class a '''quasi-secular creed'''. Yet notably, this did not lead to a monolithic religious structure. If anything, Confucian rationalism sometimes criticized superstitions, but it '''never displaced shrine or temple traditions'''. Instead, the shogunate’s approach was pluralistic: '''Buddhism was maintained as the spiritual pillar''' (with every family affiliated to a temple), '''Shintō shrines continued their festivals''' under domain patronage, and '''Confucianism provided ethical training and civil ideology''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Japanese Religions | FSI--&gt;http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions#:~:text=ideology%20of%20state%20and%20a,Zen%E2%80%99s%20emphasis%20on%20discipline%20and&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Japanese Religions | FSI--&gt;http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions#:~:text=of%20the%20warrior%2C%20that%20brought,the%20nineteenth%20and%20twentieth%20centuries&lt;/ref&gt;. The system succeeded in keeping Christianity – a potentially exclusivist, universal religion – at bay, but it did so by '''buttressing indigenous pluralism''' rather than by converting the populace to one new faith. As one historian notes, *“the Tokugawa saw the value of Confucian teachings '''along with Buddhism and Shintō''' in their effort to establish a lasting peace”* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Japanese Religions | FSI--&gt;http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions#:~:text=ideology%20of%20state%20and%20a,know%20as%20bushido%2C%20the%20way&lt;/ref&gt;. This triumvirate approach meant '''no single doctrine ruled uncontested'''. 

Indeed, Japan’s resistance to exclusive religion is highlighted by the fate of '''Christianity''' in the Edo period. After an initial period of mission activity (1549–1630s) had won converts, the Tokugawa shoguns banned Christianity precisely because it demanded exclusive loyalty to one God, which authorities perceived as subversive. One reason often given is that '''Christian monotheism’s insistence on sole worship ran counter to Japanese habits''' of multiple religious belonging &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Japanese Religions | FSI--&gt;http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions#:~:text=in%20this%20period%20as%20well%2C,and%20the%20condescending%20attitude&lt;/ref&gt;. As an analysis from Stanford notes, *“Christianity’s demand for exclusive allegiance… stood in sharp contrast to the more inclusive approach of the Japanese”* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Japanese Religions | FSI--&gt;http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions#:~:text=in%20this%20period%20as%20well%2C,and%20the%20condescending%20attitude&lt;/ref&gt;. This encapsulates how deeply pluralism was embedded: both the rulers and the people were accustomed to the idea that one could venerate '''many gods and buddhas, and follow several paths simultaneously''', without contradiction. Tokugawa policy, therefore, enforced a kind of '''religious pluralism as law''': everyone should be Buddhist (at least nominally, to prove they weren’t Christian), and they were free to also engage in Shintō and folk practices – just not exclusive monotheism. Meanwhile, '''Confucian ideals permeated education and governance''', but as a '''secular moral philosophy''', not a congregational religion. Even movements that edged toward monotheistic style devotion, such as the monotheistic leanings in some '''Neo-Confucian Shintō sects''' (e.g. teachings that venerating Amaterasu or “one deity” could be the essence), never claimed sole truth for all Japanese; they operated within the ecumenical environment of the time.

By the end of the Edo period, Japanese intellectual life was a rich blend: '''scholars of National Learning (Kokugaku)''' were re-examining Shintō classics and sometimes arguing for the primacy of native kami, Confucian scholars were laying the ethical groundwork for modern reforms, and '''Buddhist institutions remained deeply enmeshed in community life''' (funerals, memorials, parish system). Robert Bellah observed that Tokugawa Japan had a sort of '''“civil religion”''' – a set of shared values and rituals (loyalty, harmony, reverence for the emperor and nation) that drew on Shintō and Confucian symbolism, which helped unite society without a singular church or creed. Thus, Japan on the eve of the modern era was highly *religious* in practice but did not define “religion” as a singular exclusive identity. '''Multiple layers of belief coexisted''': one could visit a shrine, chant sutras, and read Confucian ethics all in one day. This inherent pluralism would be challenged – but not erased – by the revolutionary changes of the Meiji Restoration.

## The Meiji Restoration and the Invention of “Religion” (Shūkyō) in Japan

The Meiji Restoration of 1868 brought about a dramatic reordering of Japan’s religious landscape, yet even this was done in a way that *preserved religious pluralism* under new categories. When Japan opened to the West in the mid-19th century, it encountered the Western concept of “religion” (*shūkyō* 宗教) as a defined, private sphere of belief – a concept that '''had not existed in Japan in the same way''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=A%20study%20of%20how%20Japan,American%20Commodore%20Perry%20in%201853&lt;/ref&gt;. As Jason Josephson Storm documents in *The Invention of Religion in Japan*, Japanese officials were forced to '''grapple with the Western idea of “religion”''' after U.S. Commodore Perry’s arrival (1853) and the ensuing treaties that demanded “freedom of religion” in Japan &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=A%20study%20of%20how%20Japan,American%20Commodore%20Perry%20in%201853&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=Throughout%20its%20long%20history%2C%20Japan,In%20this%20book%2C%20Jason&lt;/ref&gt;. Prior to this, Japan had no single word that mapped to the Western notion of religion as distinct from state or culture; the closest were terms for specific sects or teachings (like Bukkyō for Buddhism). The Meiji state’s response was essentially to '''invent new distinctions''' to satisfy Western expectations while still maintaining Japan’s own civilizational ethos &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=Ananda%20Josephson%20reveals%20how%20Japanese,and%20cultural%20changes%20that%20followed&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=More%20than%20a%20tale%20of,reclassified%20the%20inherited%20materials%20of&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the 1868–1870s, the Meiji government promulgated policies of '''“Separating Kami and Buddhas” (神仏分離, *shinbutsu bunri*)'''. This involved legally disentangling Shintō shrines from Buddhist temples – priests had to choose whether they would be shrine priests or Buddhist clerics, Buddhist imagery was stripped from shrines, and for a short period a '''violent anti-Buddhist movement''' (廃仏毀釈, *haibutsu kishaku*) led to the destruction of some Buddhist property &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=The%20Meiji%20separation%20of%20Shinto,for%20the%20first%20time%20the&lt;/ref&gt;. The aim was to elevate what was now termed '''“Shintō” as the native cult''' of imperial Japan. However, the Meiji leaders faced a dilemma: Western nations insisted on '''religious freedom''', which Japan had to grant in order to revise unequal treaties. How to have a State Shintō and still allow freedom of religion? The solution was nuanced and revealed Japan’s continued resistance to Western-style exclusive religion.

Meiji thinkers, after much debate, '''redefined Shintō not as a “religion” but as a combination of national ceremony, morality, and loyalty'''. In 1871, the government institutionalized '''“Shrine Shintō”''' (later called State Shintō) as a set of '''rites of state''' overseen by the '''Jingikan (which was briefly revived)''' and later by the Home Ministry. They declared that visiting shrines and venerating the emperor and ancestral kami was an expression of patriotism and heritage, *not* an optional faith choice &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=that%20the%20process%20of%20articulating,effect%2C%20but%20also%20reshaped%2C%20in&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=certain%20forms%20of%20Buddhism%2C%20Japanese,Josephson%20argues%20that&lt;/ref&gt;. Meanwhile, they coined the term '''shūkyō''' (宗教) to classify '''Buddhism, Christianity, and sectarian Shintō''' as “religions” in the Western sense – meaning systems of personal belief that individuals could choose freely in private, as guaranteed by the new constitution &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=that%20the%20process%20of%20articulating,effect%2C%20but%20also%20reshaped%2C%20in&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=certain%20forms%20of%20Buddhism%2C%20Japanese,Josephson%20argues%20that&lt;/ref&gt;.

In effect, '''Japan maintained its pluralism by creating a '''dual structure''': 

- '''State/Shintō (non-religious civic practice):''' All citizens were expected to participate in Shintō shrine rites (such as bowing at a shrine, observing imperial ceremonies, worshiping at Yasukuni Shrine for war dead) as a form of civic duty and expression of Japanese identity. This was called *“Shrine Shintō”* and officially deemed '''not a religion''' but the indigenous, public tradition of Japan &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=certain%20forms%20of%20Buddhism%2C%20Japanese,effect%2C%20but%20also%20reshaped%2C%20in&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=certain%20forms%20of%20Buddhism%2C%20Japanese,Josephson%20argues%20that&lt;/ref&gt;. The idea was that one could be a Buddhist or Christian '''and''' still pay respects at a Shintō shrine, just as one salutes a flag or sings a national anthem. The Meiji state thereby avoided framing Shintō in a way that would trigger “freedom of religion” clauses – since it was *above* or *outside* that realm, '''a matter of state ceremonies and moral cultivation'''. (This move was foreshadowed by the earlier logic of the Ritsuryō code and Confucian thought, which treated kami rites as civic ritual separate from doctrinal religion &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=kami%20were%20popular%20local%20deities,a%20special%20influence%20on%20society&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=sdniryd%20separately%20from%20the%20jingiryo%2C,collusion%20with%20the%20priest%20Ddkyd&lt;/ref&gt;.)  
- '''Private Religion (shūkyō):''' Buddhism was allowed to continue, but it was now explicitly a “religion” – meaning a voluntary association of believers, one among multiple faiths. The Meiji government initially tried to marginalize Buddhism (hence the brief *haibutsu kishaku*), but by the 1870s it backed off and even relied on Buddhist temples for social functions. Christianity, newly permitted after 1873, was likewise categorized as a private religion, as were new sects like '''Tenrikyō''' or '''Konkokyō''' (which emerged from Shintō lineages but had to register as sectarian religious organizations). The Meiji Constitution of 1889 guaranteed limited '''freedom of religious belief''', but with the caveat that it not disturb public order – meaning State Shintō and imperial reverence remained paramount.

This Meiji innovation is what Josephson calls a *“politically charged, boundary-drawing exercise”* that profoundly reconfigured Japan’s religious landscape &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=certain%20forms%20of%20Buddhism%2C%20Japanese,book%20contributes%20an%20important%20perspective&lt;/ref&gt;. On one hand, it '''reshaped Shintō''': what once had been an amalgam of shrine practices entwined with Buddhism was now purified and presented as an ancient, '''unified national cult''' directly tied to the Emperor (who was declared a *arahitogami*, living god). The '''Jingikan''' was briefly restored in 1868, then replaced in 1872 by a '''Ministry of Divinities''' (教部省) and soon after by the Home Ministry’s Shrine Bureau – signaling the state’s tight control over shrine rites &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto#:~:text=Shinto%20,Kyobusho%2C%20or%20Ministry%20of%20Edification&lt;/ref&gt;. Priests became civil servants, and teaching of “Shintō doctrine” was initially attempted through the '''Great Teaching Campaign''' (1870s), though it faltered. On the other hand, the pluralism did not disappear: '''Buddhism remained deeply rooted''' (most Japanese continued to rely on Buddhist priests for funerals and ancestral rituals), and it adapted to the new era by reforming its institutions. '''Christianity gained a foothold''' but remained a small minority, partly because the majority of Japanese saw no need to replace their mixed heritage with an exclusivist creed. Moreover, the state tacitly encouraged '''new religions''' that blended elements of Shintō, Buddhism, and folk belief (many of these emerged in late 19th century) as long as they registered as sects and did not challenge imperial ideology. Thus, even as Japan modernized, it *“did not eliminate Japan’s pluralistic religious landscape”* – it reorganized it &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--[PDF] The Invention of Japanese Religions - Williams College--&gt;https://religion.williams.edu/files/2011/12/josephson.invention.pdf#:~:text=,inherited%20materials%20of%20Buddhism%2C&lt;/ref&gt;.

By the early 20th century, '''State Shintō''' functioned as a '''civil religion''': shrine attendance, emperor worship, and national festivals were promoted as expressions of patriotism (akin to how Roman state cult or modern national ceremonies function). Meanwhile, individuals could privately be '''Shin Buddhists, Catholics, Shintō sectarians, etc.''' This arrangement preserved the '''practical pluralism''' of Japanese society under a new intellectual framework. It is telling that even under State Shintō, Japan never posited a single creator deity or mandatory theology – Amaterasu was venerated as the imperial ancestor and highest kami, but not portrayed as a jealous monotheistic god; other kami continued to be worshipped, and the imperial rescripts encouraged morality and reverence rather than doctrinal conformity. Scholars like Helen Hardacre and Jason Josephson have shown that this period saw the '''conscious crafting of Shintō into something resembling a state “non-religious religion”''', a concept alien to Western categories &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=certain%20forms%20of%20Buddhism%2C%20Japanese,book%20contributes%20an%20important%20perspective&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=certain%20forms%20of%20Buddhism%2C%20Japanese,Josephson%20argues%20that&lt;/ref&gt;. The very contradiction of State Shintō – a state-prescribed set of beliefs deemed not religious – underscores Japan’s unique path. It *resisted* adopting an exclusive universal religion (even as it borrowed the trappings of modern nation-state religion) and instead '''re-asserted its traditional pluralism''' in new form. 

Indeed, Kuroda would argue that it was only through this Meiji-era process that Shintō emerged “clearly” as what we now call an independent tradition – and even then, it was a '''highly engineered construct''' built out of ancient myths, royal rites, and selectively pruned folk practices &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=The%20Meiji%20separation%20of%20Shinto,have%20yielded%20to%20this%20use&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=There%20is%20one%20further%20thing,extracting%20samples%20dealing%20only%20with&lt;/ref&gt;. The legacy of this in the 20th century was complex: after World War II, State Shintō was abolished under the Allied occupation’s mandate for separation of religion and state, and Shintō shrines became private religious institutions. But the '''underlying cultural pluralism''' remained: most Japanese to this day engage in a mix of practices (visiting shrines at New Year, Buddhist funerals, Christian-style weddings, etc.), often without feeling any conflict. The Meiji period, far from converting Japan to a Western-style religious model, actually demonstrated how Japanese society could *compartmentalize* and adapt external concepts to preserve its '''multi-layered spiritual heritage'''. As Josephson observes, the very act of defining *religion* in Japan *“extensively reclassified the inherited materials of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shintō to lasting effect”* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=practices%20of%20indigenous%20shamans%20and,book%20contributes%20an%20important%20perspective&lt;/ref&gt;, but it did not uproot them. Japan entered the modern era with '''religious pluralism codified rather than erased''' – Shintō, Buddhism, and later new religions all became part of a complex tapestry, overseen (but not unified) by the modern state.

## Comparative Perspectives: Resisting Religious Unification vs. Western and Persian Models

Japan’s historical resistance to religious unification can be further highlighted by comparing it to other great civilizations that *did* undergo religious consolidation under monotheism or a singular orthodoxy. Two instructive comparisons are ancient '''Rome''' and '''Persia''':

- '''Roman Empire (and its College of Pontiffs):''' Much like Japan’s early rulers, the Romans maintained a state-supported polytheistic cult for centuries. Rome had its own form of a “Department of Divinity” in the form of the '''College of Pontiffs''' (Collegium Pontificum). This body, led by the Pontifex Maximus, oversaw state rituals, maintained the sacred calendar, and regulated the priesthoods of various gods &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Priestly colleges of ancient Rome « IMPERIUM ROMANUM--&gt;https://imperiumromanum.pl/en/roman-religion/priestly-colleges-of-ancient-rome/#:~:text=College%20of%20Pontiffs&lt;/ref&gt;. The '''pontiffs’ role''' was analogous in some ways to the Jingikan: they ensured the proper performance of ceremonies and the observance of auspices for the well-being of the state &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Priestly colleges of ancient Rome « IMPERIUM ROMANUM--&gt;https://imperiumromanum.pl/en/roman-religion/priestly-colleges-of-ancient-rome/#:~:text=It%20was%20the%20highest%20priesthood,on%20to%20the%20Roman%20emperors&lt;/ref&gt;. Under this collegial system, the Roman state cult was quite inclusive – numerous gods from Jupiter and Mars to imported deities like Cybele or Isis were worshipped, and '''local gods of conquered peoples were often assimilated''' (the Roman principle of *interpretatio* allowed identifying foreign gods with Roman ones). For centuries, Rome *thrived* on religious pluralism not unlike Japan’s, with an underlying civic ideology (the '''Mos Maiorum''', customs of the ancestors) analogous to Japan’s use of Confucian/Shintō ethics. '''However, Rome eventually took a different turn:''' in the 4th century CE, it embraced '''Christianity as a universal religion'''. After Emperor Constantine and especially Theodosius I (in 380 CE) made '''Nicene Christianity the state church''', the old pluralism of the College of Pontiffs was dismantled &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Pontifex maximus - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifex_maximus#:~:text=the%20whole%20empire,42&lt;/ref&gt;. The imperial government began to suppress the traditional cults; the temples to Jupiter and others were closed or repurposed. In a relatively short span, the Roman Empire shifted from many gods to effectively one (the Christian God), enforced by law. The '''pontifex maximus''' title was eventually adopted by the Pope, and the institutional continuity passed to the Church. Rome’s political evolution thus included a '''religious unification''' under a monotheistic creed – something '''Japan never experienced'''. When faced with universalist religions (first Buddhism, later Christianity), Japan integrated or contained them rather than allowing one to replace the rest. Unlike Rome, which by Late Antiquity came to see the old gods as false and the new God as the exclusive truth, Japan '''persisted in seeing truth in all its traditions'''. Even today, one could say Japan has no direct equivalent of the Roman Catholic Church – no single religious authority ever ruled the spiritual realm of all Japanese in the way the Church did in medieval Europe.

- '''Persian Empire (and Zoroastrian priesthood):''' The Persian Empires, especially the '''Sassanian Empire (224–651 CE)''', offer another counterpoint. Ancient Persia originally had diverse cults and deities, but by Sassanian times, '''Zoroastrianism''' had become the '''state religion''', closely tied to the monarchy. The Sassanian rulers elevated Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian supreme god, and supported a powerful '''priestly class (magi or mobeds)''' who enforced religious orthodoxy. Sources indicate that the Sassanids practiced a '''strict form of Zoroastrian orthodoxy''' – heresy and apostasy were not tolerated. In fact, those who '''renounced the state religion could be punished by death''' under Sassanian rule &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--SASSANIDS AND THEIR ART AND WEIRD RELIGIONS | Facts and Details--&gt;https://factsanddetails.com/central-asia/Central_Asian_Topics/sub8_8b/entry-5869.html#:~:text=SASSANID%20RELIGION&lt;/ref&gt;. Competing faiths like Manichaeism were brutally persecuted; Christianity and Judaism, which did exist in the empire, were often viewed with suspicion or repressed, especially during periods of conflict with Christian Rome. The '''Zoroastrian priesthood''' thus wielded tremendous institutional power, acting as gatekeepers of a more or less unified religious doctrine serving the state. This is markedly different from Japan: at no point did Japan have a priestly class that could impose such exclusivity across the population. Even at the height of State Shintō, *heresy* was not really a concept – the state was concerned with political loyalty, not with stamping out heterodox belief in private. In Persia’s case, '''monotheistic (or dualistic) overcoding''' eventually did occur – Zoroastrianism itself, while not purely monotheistic (some call it dualist with one supreme God), carried an absolutist tone and the later Sassanian ideology admitted little religious pluralism within Iran. The outcome was that when Islam arrived in the 7th century, the old Zoroastrian establishment, rigid and closely tied to the state, could not adapt and '''rapidly collapsed'''; Persia was Islamized in the ensuing centuries. Japan’s religious scene, by contrast, was so plural and decentered that when faced with external pressure (like Christian missions or later secularization), it bent but did not break – '''no single dominant priesthood could fall and take the society’s faith with it'''. Additionally, while the Persian emperor was sacralized as a divinely sanctioned “King of Kings” upholding one true faith, the Japanese emperors (even in their Meiji apotheosis) never demanded that their subjects '''abjure all other gods'''. 

In essence, these comparisons underscore Japan’s '''unique historical trajectory'''. In Rome, a collegial, pluralistic system gave way to a universal religion; in Persia, a monotheistic state religion was enforced by a centralized priesthood. Japan, however, consistently '''avoided both of these outcomes'''. Instead of a single religious law for all (like Rome’s later decrees or Persia’s high orthodoxy), Japan maintained a layered approach: a central ideology of rule (first mythic-ritual, later ethical-national) coexisted with a diversity of religious practices among the populace. One might even say Japan’s model was closer to the '''early Roman Empire''' (when many cults were tolerated under an imperial cult) than to the late empire – with the crucial difference that Japan never imposed an exclusive imperial cult that displaced others. Even at the peak of State Shintō, Japanese subjects were not asked to deny Buddha or Christ; they were asked to affirm the emperor and participate in Shintō rites, which '''most Christians found incompatible, but many Buddhists and Shintō sectarians did not''', given the syncretic habit &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Japanese Religions | FSI--&gt;http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions#:~:text=in%20this%20period%20as%20well%2C,and%20the%20condescending%20attitude&lt;/ref&gt;. The result was that '''monotheism never dominated Japan''': Shintō remained polytheistic (with myriad kami), Buddhism in Japan was itself non-monotheistic and happy to coexist, and Confucianism provided a non-theistic moral order. 

'''Institutional evolution''' played a key role in this resistance. The '''Jingikan''' can be likened to Rome’s College of Pontiffs in function – centralizing ritual authority – but it never had the coercive dogmatic power to declare one god or one creed supreme. And when a form of supreme creed *was* declared (State Shintō), it was framed so as not to invalidate other beliefs. '''Japanese religious institutions proved malleable and inclusive''', capable of balancing multiple streams (kami, Buddhas, ancestors, nature spirits) in a single ritual system. By contrast, the Roman Church or the Zoroastrian Magi took much harder stances on exclusivity when in power. 

From a broad perspective, Japan’s case shows an alternate path in the development of civilization: one where '''“religious pluralism” was not a transitional phase to monotheism but a persistent state''' of affairs. Scholars have long debated why Japan never produced an indigenous prophet or reformer who insisted on one true god or one true way. Some suggest that the '''very concept of kami''' – multiplicious, sharding into countless avatars – ingrained a cultural acceptance of divine diversity. Others point to the '''political balance''': no conquering emperor or shōgun ever tied legitimacy to enforcing a single faith (even Hideyoshi and Ieyasu, who banned Christianity, did so for political security, not to install a rival exclusive creed). '''Helen Hardacre’s''' research stresses the continuity of the Jingikan and shrine traditions as a stable backdrop that made a separate “church” unnecessary &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto#:~:text=Hardacre%20saw%20the%20Jingikan%20as,8&lt;/ref&gt;. '''Kuroda Toshio’s''' influential thesis goes further, arguing that *“Shintō”* as we think of it was not an independent tradition at all until modernity – rather, the religious life of Japan was governed by what he calls the '''kenmitsu (exoteric-esoteric) Buddhist system''', within which kami worship was embedded &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=of%20the%20kami,the%20broader%20scheme%20of%20Buddhism&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=The%20Meiji%20separation%20of%20Shinto,have%20yielded%20to%20this%20use&lt;/ref&gt;. In this view, Japan’s '''“resistance” to unification''' was almost unconscious: there was never a vacuum in which a unifier like a Moses, Jesus, or Muhammad could operate, because the syncretic web of institutions always precluded that kind of radical break. 

Of course, these issues remain debated. Some scholars (and prewar Shintō ideologues) saw Shintō as '''Japan’s primal “one true religion”''' that simply never needed to compete – an idea dismissed by most historians, since Shintō itself has diverse forms and absorbed much from Buddhism. Others, like '''Robert Bellah''', have suggested that Japan did undergo an “Axial Age” transformation of a sort with the introduction of Buddhism and Confucianism, but that this led not to religious revolution but to a '''remarkable layering''' of traditions, yielding what Bellah termed a “tradition of no tradition,” meaning a culture where '''multiple traditions coexist without a single dominant theology'''. In any case, by comparing Japan with Rome and Persia, we see that Japan stands out for '''maintaining religious pluralism as a core feature of its civilization'''. It neither succumbed to a universalist missionary religion (as Rome did with Christianity) nor enforced a strict state monotheism (as Sassanid Persia did with Zoroastrianism). Instead, Japan’s religious history is characterized by '''continuity amid diversity''' – a complex evolution in which *synthesis and incorporation* consistently triumphed over *exclusion and replacement*. 

In summary, from the early tribal kami rites of Yayoi and Kofun, through the sophisticated syncretism of the Heian and medieval eras, and even into the nation-building of Meiji, Japan '''managed to avoid the “one-faith” paradigm'''. It cultivated institutions (like the Jingikan and shrine network) that centralized worship while honoring local autonomy &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto, A History (Hardacre, Helen) - PDFCOFFEE.COM--&gt;https://pdfcoffee.com/shinto-a-history-hardacre-helen-pdf-free.html#:~:text=fell%20apart%20after%20his%20death,the%20Yamato%20purported%20to%20rule&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shinto during the Middle and Late Heian Period, Tenth through Twelfth Centuries | Shinto | Oxford Academic--&gt;https://academic.oup.com/book/6981/chapter/151273582#:~:text=The%20Jingikan%E2%80%99s%20ability%20to%20coordinate,changed%20to%20accommodate%20new%20deities&lt;/ref&gt;; it embraced new religions by '''assimilative syncretism''' rather than by competition &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=themselves%20are%20trapped%20in%20this,Such%20religious%20forms%20are&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!----&gt;https://religion-in-japan.univie.ac.at/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf#:~:text=combination%20shrine%20and%20temple,Examples%20of%20this&lt;/ref&gt;; and when confronted with modern pressures, it redefined “religion” itself to keep '''State Shintō and plural belief''' side by side &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=certain%20forms%20of%20Buddhism%2C%20Japanese,Josephson%20argues%20that&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--The Invention of Religion in Japan - Jason Ananda Josephson - Google Books--&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C#:~:text=that%20the%20process%20of%20articulating,effect%2C%20but%20also%20reshaped%2C%20in&lt;/ref&gt;. This historico-institutional strategy ensured that '''no single religious ideology could overcode the rest'''. Japan’s people could honor innumerable kami, follow the teachings of Buddha, heed Confucian ethics, and even experiment with Western religion – all without relinquishing their older practices. Thus, Japan offers a vivid example of how a great civilization can maintain '''religious pluralism''' as a continuous thread, resisting the centripetal pull of monotheistic or universalist movements that elsewhere often led to the eclipse of older religions.

I’ll include both mainstream scholarly perspectives and alternative theories, while excluding the prophet-style theological readings of Zarathustra except when critically discussed.

I’ll explore its cultic and theological dimensions, political entanglements, institutional overcoding, and parallel comparisons to Roman and East Asian religious centralization. I’ll let you know when it’s ready for review.

# Evolution of Zoroastrianism from Indo-Iranian Roots to the Sassanid Era

## Early Indo-Iranian Religious Traditions 
Ancient Iranian religion emerged from the same Indo-Iranian matrix as the Vedic traditions of India &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=Indo,ancient%20Iran%20and%20ancient%20India&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=Comparative%20studies%20of%20ancient%20Iran,In%20Iran%20there%20are%20some&lt;/ref&gt;. Early Iranians shared a pantheon and ritual practices with their Vedic cousins: they venerated fire (Avestan *ātar*, Sanskrit *agni*) as a sacred element, performed sacrifice and libations (*yasna* in Avesta, *yajña* in Veda), and drank the sacred hallucinogenic drink *haoma* (Vedic *soma*) in ritual ceremonies &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=The%20highly%20ritualistic%20nature%20of,Gonda%2C%201962%2C%20pp&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=particularly%20important%20beings%20worthy%20of,These&lt;/ref&gt;. These commonalities reflect a period of long joint development, during which Indo-Iranian peoples worshipped a principle of cosmic order (Avestan *aša*, Vedic *ṛta*) maintained through proper ritual and truthfulness &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--IRAN ix.

Yet even in this shared heritage, we see an early divergence in how divine beings were categorized. The Indo-Iranian tradition distinguished two classes of gods: the *ahuras* (Avestan; Vedic *asuras*) versus the *daevas* (Vedic *devas*, meaning “shining ones”) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=The%20Indo,their%20parallel%20in%20the%20Greek&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--IRAN ix.

In the oldest strata of Iranian belief, *ahuras* were associated with abstract virtues and cosmic order – for example *Mithra* embodied contracts and truth – while *daevas* were gods who “acted as they pleased irrespective of the results,” not closely aligned with truth/Asha &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--IRAN ix.

This distinction was not yet a strict moral dualism, but it set the stage for later developments. Notably, in Vedic India the *devas* became the principal gods and some *asuras* fell from favor, whereas in Iran the inverse occurred: the term *daeva* eventually came to mean a demon, and *Ahura* (as in Ahura Mazda) came to denote the supreme divinity &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=The%20Indo,their%20parallel%20in%20the%20Greek&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=men%E2%80%9D%20%28Benveniste%29,23&lt;/ref&gt;. Early Greek observers like Herodotus described the Persians as worshipping natural forces – sun, moon, earth, water, fire, wind – with no idols &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=Comparative%20studies%20of%20ancient%20Iran,In%20Iran%20there%20are%20some&lt;/ref&gt;, reflecting an archaic Indo-Iranian ethos even as specific beliefs were in flux.

Archaeology hints at complex influences on early Iranian religion. The 2nd-millennium B.C.E. Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) in Central Asia may have hosted an Indo-Aryan (proto-Vedic) culture that later Iranian tribes encountered &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--IRAN ix.

Some scholars propose that '''Zoroastrianism’s birth was marked by a clash''' between two closely related traditions – the newer Iranian faith and an older Indo-Aryan cult – which had diverged just enough to conflict &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--IRAN ix.

In this view, Zoroastrianism represents the first Indo-Iranian religion defined by doctrinal worldview rather than tribal ethnicity &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--IRAN ix.

While the specifics remain debated, it’s clear that by the time the Iranians were established on the Iranian plateau (c. 1500–1000 BCE), their religious landscape combined Indo-Iranian gods, rituals, and cosmology with evolving new ideas that would culminate in Zoroastrianism.

## Zarathustra’s Reform and Early Zoroastrian Beliefs 
It was in this context that Zarathustra (Zoroaster in Greek) emerged as a pivotal reformer of Iranian religion. Though his exact date and homeland are uncertain – estimates range from roughly 1700 BCE to 600 BCE &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--ZOROASTER ii.

In the oldest Zoroastrian scriptures, the *Gathas* (hymns attributed to Zarathustra himself), he appears not as a miracle-working prophet in the later sense, but as a passionate preacher-poet. He is described as *“the author of the Gathas, the great reformer of ancient Iranian religion, and the most skilled poet of pre-Islamic Iran”* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--ZOROASTER ii.

Zarathustra’s message was, in many ways, a '''reaction against the ritualism and polytheism''' of his time &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=The%20highly%20ritualistic%20nature%20of,see&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=The%20Indo,their%20parallel%20in%20the%20Greek&lt;/ref&gt;. He championed Ahura Mazda (“Lord Wisdom”) as the supreme God and source of all goodness, effectively '''raising one deity above all others''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Zoroastrianism | Definition, Beliefs, Founder, Holy Book, &amp; Facts | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zoroastrianism#:~:text=How%20was%20Zoroastrianism%20founded%3F&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--ZOROASTER ii.

In Zarathustra’s theology, Ahura Mazda was the creator of the cosmos and the embodiment of *aša* (truth, order), opposed only by the forces of falsehood and chaos. This was a dramatic departure from the old pantheon: rather than many gods of ambiguous morality, Zarathustra presented a cosmos governed by a singular wise lord flanked by abstract divine powers, in opposition to a host of ‘wrong’ gods who choose deceit. The reformer openly '''condemned the *daevas'''* – the traditional deities who “had been genuine gods, but had been rejected” &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DAIVA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daiva-old-iranian-noun#:~:text=In%20Avestan,%C2%ADda%C4%93uua&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DAIVA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daiva-old-iranian-noun#:~:text=characterized%20by%20a%C4%93nah,is%20full%20of%20gaps%20and&lt;/ref&gt; – branding them as unworthy of worship because they did not follow Truth.

This suggests that Zarathustra’s preaching challenged established priests and cults, likely provoking hostility from those communities (later Zoroastrian legend indeed tells of his persecution by idol-worshiping priests). 

Importantly, Zarathustra’s reform emphasized '''ethical choice'''. In one Gathic verse, he describes a primordial revelation of twin spirits – one chose the Good and Truth, the other chose the Bad and the Lie &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DUALISM - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dualism/#:~:text=natures%2C%20rather%20than%20by%20choice,118&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DUALISM - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dualism/#:~:text=that%20of%20W,he%20was%20correct%20that%20it&lt;/ref&gt;. Humans, he taught, must likewise choose rightly. This idea introduced a powerful moral dualism: the world is a battlefield between truth and falsehood, and each person’s soul is enlisted in that struggle through their choices.

In any case, '''dualism lay at the heart of Zoroaster’s message''': he provided a logical answer to the problem of evil by positing a cosmic Evil to account for the world’s suffering, counterbalancing the all-good Creator &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DUALISM - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dualism/#:~:text=that%20of%20W,he%20was%20correct%20that%20it&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DUALISM - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dualism/#:~:text=was%20a%20protest%20against%20monotheism,triumph%20of%20good%20is%20implicit&lt;/ref&gt;. Ahura Mazda represents only Good; any evil in the world stems from Angra Mainyu (Ahriman), the hostile spirit. 

Zarathustra’s theology was not an outright declaration of strict monotheism – he did not deny the existence of other divine beings. Rather, he subordinated them: only Ahura Mazda was worthy of worship as highest god &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Zoroastrianism | Definition, Beliefs, Founder, Holy Book, &amp; Facts | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zoroastrianism#:~:text=How%20was%20Zoroastrianism%20founded%3F&lt;/ref&gt;, and only the *good* divine beings who align with Mazda were to be revered. In the *Gathas*, Zarathustra frequently invokes entities like *Asha* (Truth), *Vohu Manah* (Good Mind), and other personified virtues alongside Ahura Mazda. These later came to be known as the '''Amesha Spentas''' (“Holy Immortals”), and they function somewhat like archangels or aspects of Ahura Mazda’s own nature &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--AMƎŠA SPƎNTA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/amesa-spenta-beneficent-divinity#:~:text=yazata%20s%2C%20the%20six%20Am%C9%99%C5%A1a,often%20uses%20the%20terms%20a%C5%A1a&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--AMƎŠA SPƎNTA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/amesa-spenta-beneficent-divinity#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThou%2C%E2%80%9D%20sometimes%20,often%20uses%20the%20terms%20a%C5%A1a&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, Zarathustra’s role was that of a '''religious reformer''' who refined the concept of divinity: he transformed the inherited polytheistic tradition into a more philosophically coherent faith centered on one supreme God, a set of abstract divine emanations, and an ethical dualism between Truth and Lie. (Later Zoroastrian piety would remember him *as* a prophet who received revelation, but modern scholars emphasize his context as a priest-poet innovating within an existing tradition, rather than starting a brand-new religion ex nihilo.)

*Alternative interpretations:* A minority of scholars question the very historicity of Zarathustra or the attribution of the Gathas to him, suggesting the figure of “Zoroaster” may be partly legendary &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--ZOROASTER ii. GENERAL SURVEY - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://iranicaonline.org/articles/zoroaster-ii-general-survey#:~:text=In%20the%20late%2019th%20century,were%20immediately%20rejected%2C%20attempts%20to&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--ZOROASTER ii.

These radical theories argue the Gathas could have been composed later or by multiple authors, with the prophet’s biography retrojected.

The '''dating''' remains disputed (with some favoring a very early date ~1400–1200 BCE based on linguistic evidence, and others a later date ~700–600 BCE based on historical silence), but his impact is universally acknowledged: he set in motion a religious revolution in Iran whose effects would unfold over centuries.

## Adapting the Pantheon: From Many Gods to Yazatas and Daevas 
Zarathustra’s reforms did not eliminate the old gods overnight – instead, they reinterpreted them. Over time, the diverse Indo-Iranian deities were systematically classified into two categories within Zoroastrian cosmology: the '''yazata''' (worthy of worship) and the '''daeva''' (demonic) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--AMƎŠA SPƎNTA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/amesa-spenta-beneficent-divinity#:~:text=strengthening%2C%20bounteous%2C%20holy,of%20times%20in%20hendiadys%20in&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Daeva - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daeva#:~:text=In%20the%20Middle%20Persian%20,even%20in%20the%20singular&lt;/ref&gt;. This amounted to a '''transformation of the pantheon'''. Earlier polytheistic gods were not forgotten; rather, they were recast either as divine servants of Ahura Mazda or as forces of darkness to be rejected. 

On the side of good were the Amesha Spentas and the multitude of lesser *yazatas*. The term *yazata* in Avestan literally means “worthy of worship” – essentially, a deity or holy being. Zoroastrian texts enumerate many such beings, including both abstractions and what appear to be old Indo-Iranian gods now loyal to Ahura Mazda’s order. For example, *Mithra* (Miθra), the ancient Indo-Iranian god of contracts and oaths, survived in Zoroastrianism as a mighty yazata (particularly revered in the hymn Yasht 10) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=particularly%20important%20beings%20worthy%20of,These&lt;/ref&gt;. The deity *Verethragna* (Vṛtragna, symbolizing victory in battle) also remained as a yazata (called Bahrām in later tradition) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=particularly%20important%20beings%20worthy%20of,These&lt;/ref&gt;. The goddess *Anāhitā* (associated with waters and fertility) became another important yazata by the later Avestan period. These and many more – Sraosha (Obedience), Tishtrya (the star Sirius/rain), etc. – formed a whole '''angelology of yazatas''' who could be invoked for help and venerated, though always with the understanding that they served the supreme Ahura Mazda. In effect, Zoroastrianism '''absorbed earlier polytheism by hierarchical inclusion''': Ahura Mazda was the source of all goodness, and the other good gods were facets of his creation, “brought into existence to aid him in overcoming evil” &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--AMƎŠA SPƎNTA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/amesa-spenta-beneficent-divinity#:~:text=which%20included%20those%20beings%20known,35&lt;/ref&gt;. The faithful were to “praise the Amesha Spentas” and all yazatas but '''“reject the daevas”''', as one early creed declares &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--AMƎŠA SPƎNTA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/amesa-spenta-beneficent-divinity#:~:text=in%20the%20ancient%20Yasna%20Hapta%C5%8Bh%C4%81iti,%E2%80%9D&lt;/ref&gt;.

Central among the yazatas were the '''Amesha Spentas''' (“Holy Immortals”). These six (or seven, including Ahura Mazda himself) high divinities represent both cosmic aspects and ethical virtues: for instance, Asha Vahišta (Best Truth/Order), Vohu Manah (Good Mind/Love), Spenta Armaiti (Holy Devotion), Xšaθra Vairya (Desirable Dominion), Haurvatāt (Wholeness/Health), and Ameretāt (Immortality) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--AMƎŠA SPƎNTA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/amesa-spenta-beneficent-divinity#:~:text=yazata%20s%2C%20the%20six%20Am%C9%99%C5%A1a,often%20uses%20the%20terms%20a%C5%A1a&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Daeva - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daeva#:~:text=particular%2C%20Ahriman%20is%20seen%20to,Avestan%20Amesha%20Spentas&lt;/ref&gt;. In Zoroastrian doctrine, they are essentially emanations or attributes of Ahura Mazda. Mary Boyce notes that they *“hypostatize aspects of God’s own nature, and are so close to him that Zoroaster addresses Ahura Mazda sometimes as ‘Thou,’ sometimes with the plural ‘You’ when apprehending Him together with one or more of these Beings”* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--AMƎŠA SPƎNTA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/amesa-spenta-beneficent-divinity#:~:text=yazata%20s%2C%20the%20six%20Am%C9%99%C5%A1a,often%20uses%20the%20terms%20a%C5%A1a&lt;/ref&gt;. This reflects an interesting dynamic: Zoroastrianism at once '''approaches monotheism''', since Ahura Mazda and his Immortals operate with one will, and '''retains polytheistic tradition''' by preserving these distinct divine figures with specific roles. The Amesha Spentas function much like archangels or the emanations of a supreme God – comparable to, say, the seven archangels in later Judeo-Christian lore, or the emanation of divine attributes in other mystical systems. They also have explicit counter-parts among the forces of darkness (as we will see), underscoring the dualist schema.

On the side of evil, the older gods that had been rejected were systematically demonized as *Daevas* (*dews* in later Persian). '''To Zoroastrians, the Daevas became synonymous with demons''' – deceitful, destructive entities in service of Angra Mainyu (Ahriman), the spirit of evil &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Daeva - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daeva#:~:text=Dew%20s%20play%20a%20crucial,Avestan%20%2095&lt;/ref&gt;. This demonization can be seen as the mirror-image of the promotion of the yazatas. Notably, several prominent gods of the Indo-Iranian pantheon were recast as demon adversaries. A striking example is *Indra*: in Vedic India, Indra was king of the gods and slayer of the dragon Vṛtra, but in the Avesta Indra (*Indar*) is listed as a demonic figure opposed to Truth &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=%E2%80%9Csmiting%20of%20resistance%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20personification,Lommel%2C%201939%3B%20de%20Menasce%3B%20Burrow&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Daeva - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daeva#:~:text=%28WZ%2035,18&lt;/ref&gt;. Similarly, *Saurva* (likely related to the Hindu god Sharva/Rudra) appears as a fiend, and *Nanhaithya* (possibly corresponding to the Nasatyas or a deity of discord) is also a daeva &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=%E2%80%9Csmiting%20of%20resistance%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20personification,Lommel%2C%201939%3B%20de%20Menasce%3B%20Burrow&lt;/ref&gt;. These names appear in Zoroastrian scripture as potent demons who chose “the Worst Mind” and are to be rejected. By late tradition (Pahlavi texts like the *Bundahišn*), the demon host is carefully structured: Ahriman is said to have created six arch-daevas as the malign opposites to the six Amesha Spentas &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Daeva - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daeva#:~:text=Dew%20s%20play%20a%20crucial,Avestan%20%2095&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Daeva - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daeva#:~:text=Vendidad%2010,18&lt;/ref&gt;. For instance, Akōman (“Evil Mind”) opposes Vohu Manah (Good Mind), and Indar (demon of rebellion) opposes Asha Vahišta (Truth) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Daeva - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daeva#:~:text=%28WZ%2035,18&lt;/ref&gt;. This one-to-one mapping suggests a '''complete overhauling of the old pantheon into a dualistic framework''': every principle of good has its shadow. 

It is important to note that this process of elevating some deities and demonizing others '''was gradual''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DAIVA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daiva-old-iranian-noun#:~:text=inscription%20of%20Xerxes%20I%20%28r,a&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DAIVA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daiva-old-iranian-noun#:~:text=In%20Avestan,%C2%ADda%C4%93uua&lt;/ref&gt;. In Zarathustra’s own Gathas, the term *daeva* already carries a negative connotation, but the demonization was not yet fully systematic &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DAIVA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daiva-old-iranian-noun#:~:text=characterized%20by%20a%C4%93nah,doctrines%20expressed%20in%20the%20two&lt;/ref&gt;. The Gathas do not enumerate specific daevas by name, implying that the identification of which old gods were “demons” solidified in later generations &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DAIVA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daiva-old-iranian-noun#:~:text=from%20the%20Gathas%20that%20the,Nor&lt;/ref&gt;. By the time of the Younger Avesta and later Middle Persian writings, however, the dichotomy was firm: *Daeva* meant an evil, false god – essentially, a devil. This semantic shift itself tells the story of Zoroastrianism’s triumph over the older religion: '''what had once been gods of Iran became, in the new religion, devils''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=The%20Indo,their%20parallel%20in%20the%20Greek&lt;/ref&gt;. Conversely, the word *Ahura* (lord) which in Vedic usage had sometimes referred to demonic powers, in Iran came to mean exclusively the good divinities (Ahura Mazda foremost among them) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--INDO-IRANIAN RELIGION - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/indo-iranian-religion/#:~:text=similar%20to%20the%20Vedic%20deva%2Fmartya%2C,23&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Zoroastrian tradition thus achieved a remarkable reconciliation of continuity and change. The faith remained recognizable to an Iranian of the Bronze Age – fire was still sacred, Mithra and other beloved figures were still honored, the ritual life (with offerings, recitation of hymns, sacred drink, etc.) continued. But all of it was now subsumed under a '''unified theological vision''': one Supreme God, source of all good, aided by his angels, versus a malevolent Spirit and his demonic cohort. In effect, Zoroastrianism became a *henotheistic* or *dualistic-monotheist* system: monotheist in worship of the one God (Mazda), dualist in cosmology (good versus evil), and yet polytheist in practice (a multitude of lesser divine beings acknowledged). This complex synthesis provided the religion with great resilience and adaptability in the face of political and social change. 

## Crystallization of Dualism and Mazda’s Supremacy 
Over the centuries following Zarathustra, the Zoroastrian worldview further crystallized its '''doctrine of dualism''' and the supremacy of Ahura Mazda. The basic tenets laid out in the Gathas – the opposition of Truth (Asha) and Falsehood (Druj), of the “Bounteous Spirit” (*Spenta Mainyu*) and the “Destructive Spirit” (*Angra Mainyu*) – were elaborated into a fully developed cosmology. Crucially, Ahura Mazda was identified with the Bounteous Spirit of Good, and became seen not just as *a* supreme god, but as '''the transcendent creator who would ultimately triumph''' over evil. 

Already by the Achaemenid era (6th–4th century BCE), royal inscriptions present Ahura Mazda as an unchallenged supreme deity. Darius I, for example, in the Behistun inscription (c. 520 BCE) invokes Ahura Mazda as the granter of victory and legitimacy to his kingship, with hardly a mention of any other god. There is '''no reference to Angra Mainyu''' or an independent evil god in those Old Persian inscriptions – suggesting that at that time, the Persian kings propagated a quasi-monotheistic reverence of Ahura Mazda &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--IRAN ix. RELIGIONS IN IRAN (1) Pre-Islamic (1.1) Overview - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://iranicaonline.org/articles/iran-ix1-religions-in-iran-pre-islamic#:~:text=own%20ancient%20religion%20when%20the,as%20the%20attitudes%20of%20the&lt;/ref&gt;. Scholars interpret this as a '''henotheistic stance''': Ahura Mazda was worshipped as creator and highest god, while any acknowledgment of the evil spirit was muted (perhaps because emphasizing an anti-god might undermine the king’s claim of divine order). Instead, Achaemenid inscriptions occasionally refer to *drauga* (the Lie) as what must be resisted, indicating the moral dualism without personifying the Evil as an equal deity.

However, Zoroastrian '''cosmic dualism became more explicit in later texts''', particularly in the Sassanid period. In the 3rd–7th centuries CE, we find in Middle Persian literature clear depictions of Ahriman (Angra Mainyu) as a powerful entity who from the beginning opposed Ohrmazd (Ahura Mazda). The cosmos is described as a mixture of good and evil substances, resulting from Ahriman’s assault on Ahura Mazda’s good creation. Yet orthodox doctrine maintained that Ahura Mazda was still supreme and omniscient, foreknowing his eventual victory. To reconcile Mazda’s omnipotence with the existence of a co-eternal evil, a theological school in the late Achaemenid or Parthian era introduced '''Zurvanism''' – an intriguing heterodox interpretation. Zurvanism posited *Zurvan* (Time or Fate) as the ultimate principle that begat twin sons: Ormazd (Ohrmazd) and Ahriman &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DUALISM - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dualism/#:~:text=historical%20development%20of%20Iranian%20dualism,pace%20Bianchi%2C%201958%3B%20Mol%C3%A9&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DUALISM - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dualism/#:~:text=In%20the%20Zurvanite%20myth%20as,preserving%20Zoroastrian%20moral%20values%20and&lt;/ref&gt;. In this view, both good and evil stem from a single primordial source (Time), with a predetermined limit to the reign of evil. Zurvanite myths tell how Zurvan granted dominion to Ahriman for 9,000 years, after which Ormazd would rule forever &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DUALISM - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dualism/#:~:text=In%20the%20Zurvanite%20myth%20as,preserving%20Zoroastrian%20moral%20values%20and&lt;/ref&gt;. This was essentially an attempt to '''“overcode” dualism with a higher monism''', subordinating both spirits to an impersonal fate. While Zurvanism likely had some influence (Greek sources suggest some Persians of the later Achaemenid period had such ideas &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DUALISM - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dualism/#:~:text=%28Henning%2C%201951%2C%20p,represented%20in%20almost%20symmetrical%20opposition&lt;/ref&gt;), it was ultimately deemed heretical by Zoroastrian orthodoxy. The orthodox Sassanian stance – reflected in Pahlavi texts like the *Bundahišn* – was a “simplified dualism” of '''Ohrmazd vs. Ahriman as two primordial spirits''' locked in conflict &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DUALISM - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dualism/#:~:text=historical%20development%20of%20Iranian%20dualism,pace%20Bianchi%2C%201958%3B%20Mol%C3%A9&lt;/ref&gt;. They are “almost symmetrical” in power &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DUALISM - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dualism/#:~:text=historical%20development%20of%20Iranian%20dualism,pace%20Bianchi%2C%201958%3B%20Mol%C3%A9&lt;/ref&gt;, but critically not equal in dignity or outcome: Ohrmazd is inherently truth and light, while Ahriman is darkness and falsehood, and time is linear with an inevitable triumph of good.

This '''Sassanid crystallization of theology''' codified earlier teachings and folk beliefs into a structured doctrine. By the late Sassanid era, Zoroastrian theologians described creation in a series of stages (the good creation in a spiritual form, the invasion of Ahriman, the mixing of good and evil in the material world, and the final separation at the end of time). Ahura Mazda’s supremacy was affirmed in that he initiated creation and will, through the Saoshyant (savior) and final resurrection, *restore* perfection, defeating Ahriman. Yet, during the battle phase, Ahriman is allowed to wreak havoc, which explains the present world’s corruption. In daily worship and devotion, Ahura Mazda was the foremost object of praise, but always alongside the '''acknowledgment of cosmic dualism''' – for example, Zoroastrians prayed to uphold *asha* and repel *druj*, aligning themselves with Mazda’s side in the great struggle. 

One can observe that as Zoroastrianism became tied to imperial power (first Achaemenid, then especially Sassanid), the '''emphasis on a single supreme god and a unifying dualist creed intensified''', likely as a means of ideological consolidation. Achaemenid kings already saw Mazda worship as a tool for imperial ideology: Darius and Xerxes, for instance, portrayed themselves as chosen by Ahura Mazda to rule justly and to suppress the *drauga* (lies/rebellion). The Sassanid kings went further, '''positioning themselves as guardians of Ormazd’s order on earth''', which meant enforcing religious uniformity and combating perceived forces of darkness, be they spiritual (heresies, demons) or political (hostile peoples labeled as followers of the Lie).

## Zoroastrianism under the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BCE)
The Achaemenid Empire provides the first historical evidence of Zoroastrianism as an influential religion – albeit in a form adapted to imperial realities. It is now widely accepted that the Achaemenid royal family were Zoroastrians or at least strongly influenced by Zarathustran teachings &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--IRAN ix.

They credit “Wise Lord Mazda” with creating heaven and earth and with aiding the king – a clear endorsement of Mazda’s supremacy. '''Other deities are rarely mentioned''' in early inscriptions, with a couple of late exceptions (Artaxerxes II, in the 4th century, acknowledges Mithra and Anāhitā alongside Ahura Mazda). This suggests that the Achaemenid court promoted a '''henotheistic worship of Ahura Mazda''' as a unifying imperial cult, even if in practice many subjects still honored various gods. Indeed, as one scholar puts it, the Achaemenids likely introduced “a non-local tradition as the religion of the court” which over time spread through western Iran &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--IRAN ix. RELIGIONS IN IRAN (1) Pre-Islamic (1.1) Overview - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://iranicaonline.org/articles/iran-ix1-religions-in-iran-pre-islamic#:~:text=own%20ancient%20religion%20when%20the,as%20the%20attitudes%20of%20the&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Despite their personal devotion to Ahura Mazda, the early Achaemenid kings were relatively '''tolerant of other faiths''' – famous examples include Cyrus permitting the Babylonians to continue worshipping Marduk, and allowing the Jews to rebuild the Jerusalem Temple. This was practical governance of a multi-cultural empire. However, there is intriguing evidence that they drew a line when it came to *daiva*-worship within their realm. King Xerxes, in particular, describes in the so-called '''“Daiva inscription”''' a campaign of religious suppression: *“By the favor of Ahura Mazda I destroyed that establishment of the daivas and I proclaimed, ‘The daivas shall not be worshipped!’”* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Daeva - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daeva#:~:text=In%20his%20inscription%2C%20Xerxes%20records,17&lt;/ref&gt;. He further mentions replacing their shrine with the proper cult of Mazda. The inscription goes on to imply that a certain land had been in rebellion, and that rebellion involved *daiva*-worship which he eradicated &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DAIVA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daiva-old-iranian-noun#:~:text=the%20reign%20of%20Xerxes,country%20to%20its%20former%20condition&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DAIVA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daiva-old-iranian-noun#:~:text=known%20of%20the%20Achaemenids%E2%80%99%20religious,with%20the%20gods%20of%20Babylon&lt;/ref&gt;. Scholars debate which region this refers to – possibilities include Babylon (where Xerxes did quash a revolt and reportedly damaged temples) or some Iranian locale attached to the older religion &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DAIVA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daiva-old-iranian-noun#:~:text=s%20had%20been%20worshiped%2C%20it,79%29%20has&lt;/ref&gt;. Regardless, Xerxes frames it as '''religious policy''': *“Xerxes...was recording the destruction of an Iranian sanctuary devoted to the worship of those warlike beings condemned by the prophet”*, argues Mary Boyce &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DAIVA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daiva-old-iranian-noun#:~:text=Boyce%20%28Zoroastrianism%20II%2C%20p,mentioned%20by%20Xerxes%20were%20Mithra&lt;/ref&gt;. In other words, he saw himself as acting *“as a Zoroastrian”* king upholding the prophet’s creed by eliminating cults of the daevas. Other historians suggest his motives were partly political (suppressing dissident cults that might rally opposition) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Daeva - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daeva#:~:text=shalt%20not%20worship%21%27,17&lt;/ref&gt;. In either case, under Xerxes the empire took a decisive step of '''state-enforced Mazda worship''': *“Xerxes replaced the rebels’ cult with the official Achaemenid cult, represented by his sacrifice to Ahura Mazda according to a precise ritual”* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--DAIVA - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daiva-old-iranian-noun#:~:text=An%C4%81hit%C4%81%20%28Yt,origin%2C%20who%20might%20side%20with&lt;/ref&gt;. This is a remarkable early instance of “despotic overcoding” – the imperial power stamping out local religious practice to impose a central orthodoxy.

Overall, during the Achaemenid period, Zoroastrianism was '''likely not yet a fully formalized “state religion”''', but it was certainly the religion of the state’s leaders. The *Magi*, a Median priestly tribe, were integrated into the imperial structure as ritual specialists. Herodotus notes that Persians had Magi officiate sacrifices and that they had certain taboos and rites (like exposing the dead to be eaten by birds) that align with known Zoroastrian practice &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--ARDAŠĪR I i. History - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ardasir-i/#:~:text=Arda%C5%A1%C4%ABr%E2%80%99s%20policy%20toward%20other%20religions,or%20at%20any%20rate%20milder&lt;/ref&gt;. The Magi’s exact relationship to Zarathustra’s teachings is uncertain – some think they were an older Median priesthood who adopted Zoroastrian reforms over time. A famous incident is the *Magi revolt* of 522 BCE: a Magian named Gaumāta usurped the throne by pretending to be Bardiya (Smerdis), which Darius eventually quashed. Darius’s inscription stresses Ahura Mazda’s help in defeating this impostor, and later Zoroastrian tradition vilified Gaumāta as a heretic. This suggests there may have been tensions between '''orthodox Mazdean loyalists''' and other factions (perhaps those with different religious ideas) even at the imperial court. 

By the end of the Achaemenid era, Zoroastrianism had likely spread among Iranians broadly, though pockets of traditional polytheism persisted. The empire’s collapse under Alexander (331 BCE) and the ensuing Hellenistic rule disrupted Zoroastrian institutions. Greek sources like Plutarch mention that Alexander “burned the sacred books” of the Persians (perhaps the Avesta), though this account may be exaggerated. Nevertheless, Zoroastrianism survived, chiefly in the former Achaemenid heartlands and in the eastern regions (like Parthia, Bactria) that were more remote from Greek influence. 

## Parthian Era and Hellenistic Challenges (247 BCE – 224 CE)
The Parthian (Arsacid) Empire, which succeeded Seleucid Greek rule in Iran, represents a more diffuse chapter in Zoroastrian history. The Parthians, a loosely organized feudal dynasty of north-eastern Iranian origin, did not establish a centralized state religion to the degree the Achaemenids or Sassanids did. Instead, religious practice during Parthian rule was '''regional and syncretic'''. Local aristocrats (hazarpat’s and kings of semi-independent kingdoms under Parthian suzerainty) likely patronized their own cults. We have evidence of '''Hellenistic influence and syncretism''': for instance, temples from the Parthian period sometimes contain statues and imagery of Greco-Iranian style. One famous site is Kangavar in western Iran, which has ruins of a temple traditionally thought to be dedicated to Anāhitā but built with Hellenistic architectural flair. The very fact that idols and temple sculptures existed (something orthodox Zoroastrianism frowned upon under later Sassanids) shows that the old Iranian habit of aniconic worship had been relaxed in places – possibly an effect of Greek cultural influence. 

Yet Zoroastrianism did not disappear. The Parthians themselves, being Iranian, honored fire and likely followed many Zoroastrian customs. They continued to have Magi priests; indeed, some Zoroastrian texts preserved by the later tradition (like parts of the *Yashts* and *Vendidad*) may have been written down or codified in the Parthian period. The Arsacid kings, though tolerant and often patrons of Hellenistic religions and even Buddhism in the east, also presented themselves as *Mazda-worshipping* kings on some occasions. We have coins of certain Parthian rulers (e.g. King Orodes II) that depict a fire altar, suggesting imperial reverence for the sacred fire. The Parthian era likely saw '''multiple forms of Zoroastrianism''' flourishing: an official form at the royal court, and various local variants. Some Parthian nobility in the east (like in Sistan and Bactria) might have preserved purer Zoroastrian traditions away from Hellenizing influences, while those in Mesopotamia and Media mingled with Greek and Babylonian elements. Indeed, Parthia’s religious landscape was pluralistic – we see evidence of Greek deities, local Iranian gods, the cult of Mihr/Mithras spreading west (Mithraism in the Roman world may have Parthian Iranian connections), and nascent Manichaeism and Christianity by the 3rd century CE. 

Thus, under Parthian rule, '''Zoroastrianism lacked a centralized structure'''. There was no single “church of Persia” dictating orthodoxy across the empire. Instead, the faith persisted in a decentralized fashion, carried by priestly families and oral tradition. This situation set the stage for what came next: when the Sassanid dynasty arose, it perceived the need to '''reform, unify, and “rescue” the Zoroastrian religion''' from what they viewed as the neglect or heterodoxy of Parthian times &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Sasanian Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire#:~:text=Tansar%20included%20some%20attacks%20on,148&lt;/ref&gt;. Later Zoroastrian writings accuse the Parthians of allowing the religion to decay – a testament to the changes the Sassanids would implement.

## Institutionalization under the Sassanid Empire (224–651 CE) 
 &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--image--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the Sassanid dynasty in 224 CE marked a '''watershed in Zoroastrian history'''. Under Sassanid rule, Zoroastrianism was systematically organized into a state religion with a formal priesthood, authoritative scriptures, and enforced orthodoxy. The early Sassanid kings saw themselves as heirs to the Achaemenids, and they pursued a deliberate policy of reviving and '''centralizing the “Good Religion”''' as a pillar of their imperial ideology. As a result, Zoroastrian doctrine and ritual underwent a degree of standardization and “overcoding” by the state that it had never seen before.

The founding Sassanid king, Ardashir I (r. 224–240), set the tone. A descendant of a line of hereditary priests from Persis (Fārs), Ardashir was deeply devoted to Ahura Mazda. Legend says his father, Pāpak, was son of a Persian priest (perhaps named Sāsān, from whom “Sassanid” comes). Upon seizing power, Ardashir invoked divine sanction vigorously: rock reliefs from his reign – such as the famous investiture relief at Naqsh-e Rustam – depict Ardashir receiving the ring of kingship from Ahura Mazda himself &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Ahura Mazda and Ardashir I - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda_and_Ardashir_I#:~:text=The%20inscription%20shows%20Ardashir%20I,trampling%20the%20devil%27s%20dead%20body&lt;/ref&gt;. In this scene, the god and king are on horseback facing each other, with Ardashir’s horse trampling the last Parthian king, and Ahura Mazda’s horse trampling Ahriman (the “devil”) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Ahura Mazda and Ardashir I - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda_and_Ardashir_I#:~:text=The%20inscription%20shows%20Ardashir%20I,trampling%20the%20devil%27s%20dead%20body&lt;/ref&gt;. The message is unmistakable: '''the new monarchy is established by Ahura Mazda’s will, triumphing over both political and cosmic enemies'''. Notably, the figure of a Zoroastrian *mobed* (priest) is present in the relief as well (identified as the high priest Kartir in later inscriptions) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Ahura Mazda and Ardashir I - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda_and_Ardashir_I#:~:text=The%20inscription%20shows%20Ardashir%20I,trampling%20the%20devil%27s%20dead%20body&lt;/ref&gt;, symbolizing the close alliance of throne and altar. Indeed, a Middle Persian maxim attributed to Ardashir states: *“Know that the religion and the monarchy are two brothers; neither can exist without the other. The religion sustains the monarchy, and the monarchy protects the religion”* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--ARDAŠĪR I i. History - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ardasir-i/#:~:text=Arda%C5%A1%C4%ABr%E2%80%99s%20words%20concerning%20the%20church,Walburg%2C%20loc.%20cit&lt;/ref&gt;. This became the core principle of Sassanid statecraft.

Under Ardashir and his son Shapur I, we see the initial steps of '''institutionalizing Zoroastrianism'''. A chief priestly advisor, '''Tansar (or Tosar)''', is credited with important reforms. According to later accounts (the *Letter of Tansar* preserved in Arabic histories), Tansar helped Ardashir by writing to local kings urging them to accept Ardashir’s suzerainty and abandon heterodox practices &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Sasanian Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire#:~:text=he%20sought%20the%20aid%20of,the%20old%20ways%20had%20been&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Sasanian Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire#:~:text=Tansar%20included%20some%20attacks%20on,148&lt;/ref&gt;. Tansar allegedly criticized the Parthians for neglecting true religion and allowing it to fragment, and he argued for the '''“restoration” of Zoroastrianism to its former purity''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Sasanian Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire#:~:text=Tansar%20included%20some%20attacks%20on,148&lt;/ref&gt;. Most significantly, *“Tansar would later help to oversee the formation of a single Zoroastrian church under the control of the Persian magi, alongside the establishment of a single set of Avestan texts, which he himself approved and authorized.”* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Sasanian Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire#:~:text=Tansar%20%20would%20later%20help,he%20himself%20approved%20and%20authorised&lt;/ref&gt;. This points to the '''canonization of the Avesta''' (the holy scriptures) under early Sassanid auspices. The Avesta had existed mostly in oral form; tradition holds that much was lost during Alexander’s conquest. Ardashir and his clergy sought out scattered texts and oral lore and began compiling an authoritative version. This process likely continued for decades, reaching completion under Shapur II in the 4th century, but the initiative is attributed to Ardashir’s reign. In essence, the Sassanids set out to '''create a unified scripture and a unified clergy''' where before there was diversity.

Shapur I (r. 240–272) continued these policies, even as he was relatively tolerant toward new religious movements (he gave audience to the prophet Mani, for example). After Shapur I, however, came a decisive turn: the rise of the influential high priest '''Kartir (Kerdir)'''. Kartir’s career, documented in his own rock inscriptions, exemplifies the Sassanid drive for religious centralization. Serving under multiple kings from Shapur I through Bahram II, Kartir amassed titles and powers unprecedented for a priest. By Shapur I’s later reign, Kartir was appointed as *“leader of the order of priests”* empire-wide &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Sasanian Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire#:~:text=Kartir%20%2C%20a%20very%20powerful,implication%20that%20all%20regional%20Zoroastrian&lt;/ref&gt;. He boasts that under King Bahram I, *“all the Magi in all provinces were subordinated to me”*, effectively making him the '''Grand Magus of the empire''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Sasanian Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire#:~:text=allowed%20to%20have%20his%20own,and%20temples%20containing%20images%20and&lt;/ref&gt;. This was the first known attempt to create a '''hierarchical, “state-wide” church structure''' for Zoroastrianism, with the chief mobed in Fars overseeing regional clergy &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Sasanian Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire#:~:text=allowed%20to%20have%20his%20own,and%20temples%20containing%20images%20and&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Kartir used his authority to enforce orthodoxy. He proclaims in his inscription that he '''suppressed non-Zoroastrian religions''' vigorously: *“Non-Mazdayasnians were struck down in the land, including Jews, Shamans (Buddhists), Brahmans (Hindus), Christians, Nazareans, Makdags (possibly Baptists), and Zandiks (Manichaeans). Idols were destroyed; the dens of the demons were obliterated and turned into fire altars.”* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--KARTIR - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kartir/#:~:text=Non,were%20obliterated%20and%20turned%20into&lt;/ref&gt;. This extraordinary statement shows the '''religious intolerance and persecution''' that became state policy. By Kartir’s influence, the Sassanid state saw heresy and infidel cults as threats to the divine order and thus to the empire. We hear of edicts against the Jews and measures to curtail their communal autonomy (e.g. forbidding certain practices) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--ARDAŠĪR I i. History - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ardasir-i/#:~:text=Arda%C5%A1%C4%ABr%E2%80%99s%20policy%20toward%20other%20religions,or%20at%20any%20rate%20milder&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--KARTIR - Encyclopaedia Iranica--&gt;https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kartir/#:~:text=Moshe%20Beer%2C%20in%20his%20study,his%20own%20testimony%2C%E2%80%9D%20involved%20very&lt;/ref&gt;. We see outright violence against Manichaeism – Mani was executed around 276 CE, and Kartir took credit for stamping out the Manichaean “devil-worship.” He even targeted Christian communities as they grew (though Christians, being connected to Rome, were sometimes treated diplomatically under different kings). In Zoroastrian terms, these acts were portrayed as purifying the empire of *druj* and upholding *asha*. The burning of idols and conversion of “demon dens” into fire-temples is especially symbolic: it signifies replacing heterodox shrines (perhaps those of the old gods or foreign gods) with '''Atash Bahram''' fires (Victorious Fires) dedicated to Ahura Mazda &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Sasanian Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire#:~:text=Naqsh,In&lt;/ref&gt;. In essence, Kartir was an *iconoclast* enacting the ultimate “despotic overcoding”: transforming local cult sites into standardized state-sanctioned temples &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Sasanian Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire#:~:text=Naqsh,In&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Institutionally, the Sassanids created a tightly knit '''church-state complex'''. They established major fire temples throughout the empire (the three Great Fires of Iran, linked to the three social classes – one for kings/warriors, one for priests, one for farmers – date to this era). A synod or council of Magi may have periodically convened to decide doctrinal matters. The Avesta was transcribed into the Avestan alphabet (an innovation of the Sassanid period) and supplemented by authoritative Pahlavi commentaries (Zend). A formal hierarchy of clergy emerged: from local *mōbeds* (priests) up to the *mōbedān mōbed* (chief priest) who often wielded influence at court. The kings after Kartir’s time continued to support the Zoroastrian clergy, though there were fluctuations – for instance, King Narseh (r. 293–302) seems to have curbed Kartir’s power (as Kartir disappears from records after Narseh’s accession). In the 4th century, Shapur II oversaw a renewal of zeal, convening councils to fix the canon of the Avesta and perhaps to condemn heresies. By the late 5th and 6th centuries, under Kings like Kavad and Khosrow I, the Zoroastrian establishment was so entrenched that even royal experiments (like Kavad’s flirtation with the Mazdakite heresy) caused major upheavals. The traditional Zoroastrian clergy ultimately triumphed by backing Khosrow I, who restored orthodox order. 

In sum, under the Sassanids '''Zoroastrianism became a true state religion''' – a key instrument of imperial unity and identity. The faith was used to legitimize kings (who took on titles like “Mazda-worshipping lord” in inscriptions &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Ahura Mazda and Ardashir I - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda_and_Ardashir_I#:~:text=There%27s%20an%20inscription%20on%20Ardashir%27s,figure%20of%20the%20God%20Ahuramazda&lt;/ref&gt;) and to integrate the empire’s diverse lands under a shared ideology. This did come at the cost of suppressing religious plurality; and ironically, the harshness of Zoroastrian clerical rule in the late Sassanid period may have sown discontent among religious minorities, perhaps easing the Arab Muslim conquest later. But from a historical perspective, the Sassanid effort represents one of the ancient world’s most thorough examples of '''religious centralization''': the crown and altar were yoked in what has been called a “Zoroastrian church-state”. As one late antique source put it, in Sassanid Iran *“religion and state were twins”* – echoing Ardashir’s maxim – and indeed this partnership held until the very end of the empire.

## Comparative Perspectives: State, Religion, and Centralization 
The Zoroastrian experience under the Sassanids finds parallels (and contrasts) in other parts of the world, as rulers elsewhere also harnessed religion for political ends – often enforcing orthodoxy, suppressing local cults, or institutionalizing worship. A comparison with the Roman Empire and with East Asia (notably Japan’s early state formation) is illuminating in terms of '''local religious suppression, syncretism, and institutional preservation'''.

'''Roman Empire:''' In its first few centuries, the Roman Empire practiced a generally '''inclusive religious policy''', not unlike the Achaemenids. As it expanded, Rome absorbed the gods and cults of conquered peoples: local deities were identified with Roman ones or honored alongside them, as long as loyalty to the Empire was maintained &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=The%20Roman%20Empire%20expanded%20to,and%20practical%20advantages%2C%20especially%20to&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=Latin%2C%20Etruscan%20and%20other%20Italian,the%20middle%20of%20the%201st&lt;/ref&gt;. The Romans famously tolerated a plethora of cults – from Egyptian Isis to Persian Mithras – and even foreign priests could operate, provided the '''Imperial Cult''' (worship of the deified Emperors and Rome’s guardian deities) was respected &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=The%20Roman%20Empire%20expanded%20to,and%20practical%20advantages%2C%20especially%20to&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=Cuicul%20%20are%20of%20emperors,172&lt;/ref&gt;. This syncretic tolerance meant *suppression* was rare and usually targeted only at groups perceived as subversive (for example, druidic rites in Gaul were suppressed for political reasons, and at times Bacchic secret societies in Italy were regulated). Local religious traditions often persisted robustly; for instance, major pilgrimage temples like the Serapeum in Alexandria or Apollo’s sanctuary at Daphne thrived well into the imperial era &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=longer%20in%20use.,172&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, Roman religious officials saw themselves as '''preservers of tradition''' – they even revived old Italian rites and kept archaic priesthoods (e.g. Vestal Virgins) alive to maintain *pax deorum* (the peace with the gods). 

However, in the late Empire a dramatic transformation occurred: the adoption of '''Christianity as the state religion'''. In 380 CE, Emperor Theodosius I declared Nicene Christianity the official faith of the Roman Empire, and within a decade he issued edicts to end state support for pagan cults &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=In%20380%2C%20under%20Theodosius%20I%2C,aspects%20of%20its%20ritual%20influenced&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=Senate%20house%20and%20began%20the,house%2C%20but&lt;/ref&gt;. The famous *Edict of Thessalonica* (380) and subsequent decrees effectively '''outlawed public pagan worship''' – temples were closed or repurposed, traditional sacrifices banned, and the old priesthoods left to wither. Theodosius “ended official support for all other creeds and cults” in 391–392, decisively turning the empire into a Christian polity &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=Senate%20house%20and%20began%20the,house%2C%20but&lt;/ref&gt;. In many places, this led to violence against local religious sites; for example, Christian mobs destroyed the Serapeum in 392. Thus, the Roman Empire went from pluralistic syncretism to a form of exclusive monotheistic centralization in a relatively short span. Interestingly, aspects of the old system were co-opted – the Christian Church, in organizing dioceses and a hierarchy under the Emperor’s influence, mirrored Rome’s administrative structure, and many '''pagan institutions were preserved in altered form''' (the Pontifex Maximus became the Emperor or, later, the Pope; festival dates were repurposed, etc.). By the Byzantine period, church and state were tightly intertwined (Caesaropapism), resembling the Zoroastrian church-state alliance: heresy was a crime, and imperial authority enforced religious uniformity (e.g. closure of the Athenian philosophical schools in 529 as “pagan” remnants). The '''suppression of local cults''' in the late Roman Empire thus offers a strong parallel to Sassanid Iran: both saw centralized states stamping out older local religions in favor of an officially sanctioned faith, be it Christianity or Mazda-worship. However, a key difference is that Rome’s shift was from many gods to one God (monotheistic conversion), whereas Zoroastrianism, though monotheistic in a sense, was the continuation of an Iranian tradition – it was more of an '''internal reform''' and consolidation of an ethnic religion than an introduction of a wholly new faith.

'''East Asia (Japan):''' In East Asia, one can compare Japan’s state formation in the 7th–8th centuries CE, particularly the creation of the '''Jingikan (Department of Divinities)''' under the Yamato state. As Japan centralized in the Asuka and Nara periods, its leaders – influenced by Chinese models – implemented a ritsuryō system of government with '''two chief administrative branches''', one secular and one spiritual. The Jingikan was the Office of Shinto, established as one of the highest organs of the state &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Jingikan | Encyclopedia.com--&gt;https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/jingikan#:~:text=Jingikan%20%28Jap,to%20be%20abolished%20in%201871&lt;/ref&gt;. It supervised all matters of *kami* (deity) worship: court rituals, seasonal festivals, the maintenance of shrines, the conduct of Shinto priests, and ceremonies like the imperial enthronement rites and the great purification (Ōharae) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Jingikan | Encyclopedia.com--&gt;https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/jingikan#:~:text=Jingikan%20%28Jap,to%20be%20abolished%20in%201871&lt;/ref&gt;. In essence, the early Japanese state '''institutionalized the indigenous Shintō religion''' as a formal apparatus of government. This was an act of '''institutional preservation''' and adaptation: clan-based local cults to various kami were brought under central oversight, codified, and tied to imperial legitimacy (the Emperor’s lineage was mythically descended from the sun-goddess Amaterasu, so state rites emphasized that connection). At the same time, Japan was incorporating a foreign religion, Buddhism, which had royal patronage. Rather than Buddhism eradicating Shinto, the state engineered a form of syncretism and parallel structure: Buddhism was handled by another department, while Shinto had the Jingikan. This meant local kami cults were neither suppressed nor left entirely autonomous – they were '''overcoded''' by state ritual and integrated into a national framework, ensuring they complemented (and did not contradict) the official ideology. The Jingikan can be seen as analogous to the Sassanid *mōbedān mōbed* and his council of Magi: a bureaucratization of religion. In both cases, earlier local practices (Japanese clan rites or Iranian regional fire cults) were centralized under court control. But unlike the Sassanids, the Japanese rulers did not aggressively persecute the old kami worship – instead, they preserved it by redefining it as state ceremonial. In that sense, the Japanese approach was more '''syncretic and preservative''' (State Shinto coexisted with Buddhism), whereas the Sassanid approach was more '''exclusive and reformative''' (Zoroastrianism was sharpened to the exclusion of rival faiths).

China offers another interesting comparison: various Chinese dynasties at times suppressed “heterodox” sects (e.g. the Northern Wei’s persecution of Buddhism in 446, or Tang suppression of foreign religions in 845) and promoted a state orthodoxy (Confucian rituals, imperial cult to Heaven). The concept of the Emperor as the pivot of both secular and spiritual order (the Son of Heaven conducting sacrifices to Heaven and Earth) has parallels with the Zoroastrian king’s role as upholder of *asha*. However, Chinese religion was never monolithic; it remained a pluralism of Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist elements. One could liken the Confucian state religion (sacrifices at the Temple of Heaven, etc.) to the Zoroastrian state cult of fire: both were maintained by the government as official rites that affirmed the cosmic mandate of the ruler. Meanwhile, popular or “local” practices were often tolerated unless seen as subversive. Only in times of perceived crisis did suppression occur (as with several proscriptions of Buddhism or foreign temples), akin to how the Sassanids cracked down hardest when they faced ideological competitors like Manichaeism or later, Christianity.

In summary, across different civilizations we observe a common pattern: as polities grew into empires or centralized states, they often '''aligned religious institutions with state power''' to solidify unity. In doing so, they might suppress or subsume local cults (the daeva shrines in Iran, the pagan temples in Christian Rome, or potentially threatening sects in China), promote syncretism (equating gods across cultures, or blending old and new rites), and set up institutional structures to preserve and control religious traditions (the Zoroastrian priestly hierarchy, the Christian Church under imperial patronage, the Jingikan managing Shinto). Zoroastrianism’s evolution from a loose collection of tribal beliefs into a centralized dualist creed under the Sassanids is a prime example of this phenomenon. It highlights both the '''creative adaptation''' of religion – reinterpreting ancient gods as angels and demons, codifying scripture – and the '''authoritarian potential''' of a state religion – using imperial might to enforce spiritual conformity. 

## Conclusion 
Over the long arc from prehistory to late antiquity, Zoroastrianism transformed profoundly. It began as an outgrowth of early Indo-Iranian religion, sharing in a polytheistic and ritualistic worldview. Zarathustra’s inspired reforms injected a new ethical dualism and elevated one God above all others, setting in motion a shift toward what many characterize as the world’s first form of monotheism or strict dualism. As Iranian society moved from tribal to imperial organization, Zoroastrianism likewise moved from flexible, local practice to an increasingly '''systematic religious system'''. The Achaemenid period affirmed Ahura Mazda’s supremacy while pragmatically tolerating diversity. The Parthian interlude allowed divergence and syncretism, but kept the flame of the “Mazda-worshipping” tradition alive. Finally, the Sassanids, in a remarkable project of state-building, '''consolidated Zoroastrianism into a formal institution''' – compiling its scriptures, defining its theology against dissent, and intertwining it inseparably with the state’s structure and identity. In doing so, they ensured the survival of Zoroastrianism as a coherent faith (a legacy that would endure even after the Islamic conquest, among Parsi and Iranian Zoroastrian minorities). 

Scholarly perspectives vary on some details: for instance, how much of Zoroastrian dualism was present from the start versus developed in response to later influences; or how “orthodox” Achaemenid religion actually was, as opposed to being a royal interpretation. Some scholars emphasize continuity – that Zoroastrianism remained essentially the same message of Zoroaster throughout – while others point to significant '''evolution and adaptation''', especially under external pressures (Hellenistic influence possibly spurring Zurvanism, competition with Christianity/Manichaeism sharpening Zoroastrian identity, etc.). But the consensus view recognizes that by the late Sassanid era, Zoroastrianism had attained a mature form: a *structured dualist theology* (with a full roster of angels, demons, cosmic history, and eschatology) and a *robust ecclesiastical framework*. 

In achieving this, Zoroastrianism offers a case study in the '''social and political development of religion'''. It illustrates how a faith can emerge from ancient myth and ritual, then be reshaped by a charismatic reformer, and finally be “codified” under the hand of empire. In comparison to other cultures – whether the imposition of Christianity by Roman emperors or the careful balancing of Shinto and Buddhism by Japanese rulers – the Zoroastrian trajectory shows both unique features (the early date of its monotheistic tendencies, the concept of cosmic dualism) and archetypal ones (the use of religion as an arm of governance). By the 6th century CE, an observer could see in Zoroastrian Iran a fully formed state religion not unlike what the later Holy Roman Empire or the Caliphates would have – with authoritative scriptures, councils of clergy, and the suppression of heresy. It is a testament to Zarathustra’s legacy that the spiritual movement he began in tribal Central Asia millennia earlier was able to become such a cornerstone of Iranian imperial culture. The “Good Religion” had evolved from humble origins into the ideological backbone of a vast empire, embodying the very merger of spiritual and temporal power that continues to fascinate historians and scholars of religion today.

I’ll begin drafting the China chapter with an optimistic tone, tracing how Chinese religious traditions—beginning from the Shang and Zhou periods—resisted monotheistic consolidation and theological overcoding. The chapter will highlight how China's polytheistic and ritual-pluralist heritage was preserved and reinforced through Confucian philosophy, Daoist multiplicity, syncretic Buddhism, and a decentralized bureaucratic state.

I’ll integrate Deleuze and Guattari's framework (especially the idea of 'overcoding') to contrast China's resistance with the fate of monotheistic traditions elsewhere. I’ll let you know when the first draft is ready.

# Religious Pluralism and the Avoidance of Monotheistic Overcoding in China

## Introduction: Many Gods, One Harmony

Ancient China offers a striking counterpoint to the well-known trajectory of Western monotheism. Whereas the Hebrew tradition moved toward an exclusive covenant with a single God – a development often seen as a tragic narrowing of ancient religious diversity – China’s religious landscape evolved in a decidedly pluralistic direction. From its earliest dynasties, Chinese civilization anchored political order in a tapestry of ancestral spirits, nature deities, and cosmic forces, rather than in one jealous deity. This opening chapter explores how China *avoided* the kind of “monotheistic overcoding” that elsewhere collapsed a rich multiplicity of gods into '''One'''. Instead, Chinese religion maintained an optimistic model of plurality: a flexible balance managed by rituals and political structures that sustained cosmic diversity. 

To tell this story, we begin in the Shang and Zhou dynasties, where ancestor worship, shamanism, oracle bones and ritual kingship laid the foundation of a pluralistic sacred order. We then see how Confucian philosophy – with its emphasis on '''li''' (ritual propriety), '''ren''' (benevolence), and social harmony – provided a moral cosmos that required no single supreme god. The rise of Daoist traditions further enriched this openness through their diverse pantheons and anti-dogmatic cosmology. Buddhism’s arrival, instead of enforcing exclusive truth, was '''transformed''' through syncretism with Confucian and Daoist practices. Throughout imperial history, the state (via institutions like the Ministry of Rites) acted as a ritual coordinator rather than a theocratic enforcer, ensuring no theology gained absolute sway. Finally, using Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of “overcoding,” we reflect on how the Chinese imperial state resisted collapsing the many into One – unlike, for example, Rome with Christianity or Persia with Zoroastrianism. In sum, Chinese civilization never underwent a shift to exclusive monotheism, thanks to a confluence of institutional, philosophical, and cultural factors that upheld pluralism and '''prevented''' the reduction of cosmic multiplicity to a single dogma.

## Ancient Foundations: Ancestors, Shamans, and Oracle Bones

China’s pluralistic ethos has deep roots in its '''Bronze Age''' civilization. During the '''Shang dynasty''' (c. 1600–1046 BCE), religion was inherently '''polytheistic''' and ancestral. The Shang king functioned as a high priest or '''shaman''', mediating between the living and a host of spirits &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion of the Shang dynasty - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_of_the_Shang_dynasty#:~:text=that%20the%20Shang%20dynasty%27s%20religion,190&lt;/ref&gt;. Oracle bone inscriptions from this period reveal a vibrant spirit world: the king would inscribe questions on ox bones or turtle shells and then interpret the cracks from fire to discern the will of ancestors and nature powers. Notably, these inscriptions show the Shang ruler worshipping many entities – from departed royal forebears to river and mountain deities – rather than one omnipotent god. For example, a Shang oracle text records the king “worshipping their ancestors and nature gods, praying for a good harvest by sacrificing sheep and cattle” &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--上海博物馆--&gt;https://www.shanghaimuseum.net/mu/frontend/pg/article/id/CI00004011#:~:text=Ox%20scapula%20inscriptions%20are%20the,for%20its%20simplicity%20and%20dignity&lt;/ref&gt;. Ancestor veneration was paramount: the departed elders of the royal lineage were believed to exert real influence on outcomes (illness, harvest, warfare) and thus had to be propitiated with ritual and sacrifice &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Chinese Works : Chinese Oracle Bones--&gt;https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-CUL-00001-00155#:~:text=of%20power%20to%20influence%20the,Success%20in%20punitive&lt;/ref&gt;. This belief in the '''power of dead ancestors''' to aid or afflict the living, and the consequent need to appease *all* these spirits, meant Shang religion could never be summed up by a single deity’s will &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Chinese Works : Chinese Oracle Bones--&gt;https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-CUL-00001-00155#:~:text=of%20power%20to%20influence%20the,Success%20in%20punitive&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, spiritual authority was distributed among a hierarchy of beings. At the apex of this hierarchy the Shang recognized '''Shangdi''' (上帝, “High Lord”), but Shangdi was less a '''creator-god''' than a supreme ancestor or high spirit who presided over many others &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion of the Shang dynasty - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_of_the_Shang_dynasty#:~:text=The%20highest%20of%20the%20Shang,was%20not%20described%20by%20Shang&lt;/ref&gt;. Crucially, Shangdi did not demand exclusive worship: he coexisted with a multitude of nature gods and ancestral spirits under him &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion of the Shang dynasty - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_of_the_Shang_dynasty#:~:text=The%20highest%20of%20the%20Shang,was%20not%20described%20by%20Shang&lt;/ref&gt;. In short, the Shang religious system was a network of '''plural powers''', with the king orchestrating rituals to maintain harmony among heaven, earth, and the ancestral clan.

The succeeding '''Zhou dynasty''' (c. 1046–256 BCE) inherited this pluralistic framework even as it introduced new concepts. The early Zhou rulers, to legitimize overthrowing the Shang, invoked '''Tian''' (天, “Heaven”) as a kind of supreme cosmic principle. The famous '''Mandate of Heaven''' idea held that Heaven granted rulers the right to govern based on their virtue, and could withdraw that mandate if they became despotic. While this might seem like a move toward a singular, moral Heaven, Zhou religion still remained far from monotheistic. “Heaven” in Zhou usage was not a personal god enforcing sole worship; it was a diffuse moral order, often interchangeable with the will of '''Shangdi''' and allied ancestral spirits &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion of the Shang dynasty - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_of_the_Shang_dynasty#:~:text=During%20the%20Western%20Zhou%20%28c,310&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, archaeological and textual evidence suggests the Zhou '''integrated''' the Shang high god into their concept of Heaven &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion of the Shang dynasty - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_of_the_Shang_dynasty#:~:text=During%20the%20Western%20Zhou%20%28c,310&lt;/ref&gt;. Heaven thus became an '''abstract high deity''' that supported just kings, but Zhou kings continued to perform ceremonies to a host of other entities – ancestors of various ranks, the spirits of soil and grain, and gods of wind, rain, and mountains. The Zhou court maintained elaborate sacrificial rituals to *hundreds* of spirits, great and small. Rather than abolishing the Shang pantheon, the Zhou *renamed* and moralized it. This set the pattern for Chinese cosmology: even when one principle (like Heaven) was elevated, it did not annihilate the rest. The legitimacy of kings still depended on honoring '''many''' invisible forces. As one historian observes, even supposedly “secular” innovations like the standardized Zhou *calendar* had a religious-political purpose: each new dynasty issued its own calendar to mark a new cosmic era, complete with its distinctive pantheon of ancestral and natural spirits &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Articles from journals--&gt;https://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/140498/#:~:text=By%20the%204_,of%20each%20new%20emperor%27s%20reign&lt;/ref&gt;. The Zhou and later Chinese states thus continually recognized '''multiplicity''' – Heaven, yes, but also Earth, ancestors, and a panoply of gods – in their ideology.

## Confucianism: Ritual Order without a Supreme God

By the late Zhou era (the *Spring and Autumn* and *Warring States* periods), Chinese thinkers were reflecting deeply on how to preserve social and cosmic order amid political chaos. It is in this context that '''Confucius''' (Kongzi, 551–479 BCE) developed a philosophy that would profoundly shape China’s religious pluralism. Confucius did *not* found a new religion with a novel god; rather, he reinterpreted the inherited ritual system ('''li''' 礼) as the foundation of a stable civilization &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Confucianism | Asia Society--&gt;https://asiasociety.org/education/confucianism#:~:text=strict%20law%20and%20statecraft%20were,honored%20and&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Confucianism | Asia Society--&gt;https://asiasociety.org/education/confucianism#:~:text=patterns%20of%20behavior%20developed%20through,unified%2C%20and%20enduring%20social%20order&lt;/ref&gt;. Confucius was concerned with the same problem a monotheistic prophet might tackle – the basis of a unified moral order – but he arrived at a '''radically different solution'''. Instead of positing a single transcendent deity who imposes order, Confucius located order in the '''performance of proper relationships''': between ruler and minister, parent and child, husband and wife, elder and younger, friend and friend. Each of these human relationships was to be guided by ritual propriety and empathy (ren). '''Ritual''', in the Confucian view, was not about appeasing one god’s jealousy, but about cultivating '''social harmony''' and virtue through time-honored forms &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Confucianism | Asia Society--&gt;https://asiasociety.org/education/confucianism#:~:text=interpreted%20these%20not%20as%20sacrifices,unified%2C%20and%20enduring%20social%20order&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Confucianism | Asia Society--&gt;https://asiasociety.org/education/confucianism#:~:text=There%20was%2C%20however%2C%20another%20side,acceptance%20of%20social%20roles%2C%20the&lt;/ref&gt;. As one analysis puts it, Confucius “interpreted [Zhou] rituals not as sacrifices asking for the blessings of the gods, but as ceremonies performed by human agents embodying civilized patterns of behavior” &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Confucianism | Asia Society--&gt;https://asiasociety.org/education/confucianism#:~:text=strict%20law%20and%20statecraft%20were,honored%20and&lt;/ref&gt;. In other words, the '''efficacy''' of ritual lay in its ability to shape ethical humans and a harmonious community – *not* in cajoling a deity. Thus, Confucianism provided a '''metaphysical and ethical framework''' for order that required no singular divine lawgiver.

It is important to note that Confucius did not deny the spiritual world; he simply downplayed its centrality. He inherited the Zhou belief in Heaven (Tian) as a sort of moral force. In Confucius’s own life, he sometimes spoke of '''Heaven’s will''' guiding him. But he was notably agnostic about the specifics of gods and spirits. A famous Analects passage has Confucius advising to “respect the ghosts and spirits but keep them at a distance” – an injunction to focus on human duties rather than divine mysteries. Indeed, Confucianism is often described as '''humanistic''' or a “civil religion” built into social institutions &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Confucianism | Asia Society--&gt;https://asiasociety.org/education/confucianism#:~:text=Confucianism%20is%20often%20characterized%20as,specialists%2C%20but%20parents%2C%20teachers%2C%20and&lt;/ref&gt;. As the Asia Society scholars note, it functioned as a “diffused religion” whose “priests” were family patriarchs, teachers, and officials, not a separate clerical class &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Confucianism | Asia Society--&gt;https://asiasociety.org/education/confucianism#:~:text=foundation%20to%20establish%20the%20social,was%20the%20arena%20of%20religion&lt;/ref&gt;. The Emperor conducting state sacrifices to Heaven or a son performing ancestral rites at home were *Confucian* acts in that they upheld social morality and continuity. But neither act implied an '''exclusive''' theological claim (“only my god is real”). In fact, because Confucianism lacked a personal creator-god or a binding dogma about the afterlife, it coexisted '''easily with pluralism'''. By emphasizing values like '''filial piety''' (xiao), '''benevolence''' (ren), and '''ritual decorum''' (li), Confucianism created a unifying cultural ethos *without* canonizing a sole deity. It upheld the importance of venerating ancestors and Heaven, but as part of a broader ethical life &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Confucianism | Asia Society--&gt;https://asiasociety.org/education/confucianism#:~:text=,was%20the%20arena%20of%20religion&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Confucianism | Asia Society--&gt;https://asiasociety.org/education/confucianism#:~:text=patterns%20of%20behavior%20developed%20through,unified%2C%20and%20enduring%20social%20order&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Under the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), Confucianism became state orthodoxy – yet the Han state still conducted sacrifices to a range of powers (Heaven, Earth, mountains, rivers, ancestors, etc.). Han Confucian scholars rationalized and systematized the old rites, effectively '''secularizing''' them. The “Mandate of Heaven” was treated as a principle of political legitimacy rather than literal theophany &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Articles from journals--&gt;https://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/140498/#:~:text=%28albeit%20pre,1975%3A%20330%E2%80%93331%3B%20Chang%201976%3A%20191%E2%80%93195&lt;/ref&gt;. Court diviners still read portents (eclipses, earthquakes) as messages from Heaven, but these practices were integrated into bureaucracy &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Articles from journals--&gt;https://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/140498/#:~:text=time%20of%20the%20Former%20Han,9&lt;/ref&gt;. The net effect was that Confucian statecraft *absorbed* Chinese religion rather than replacing it. The state cult was inclusive: Emperors in the imperial era would, for instance, perform the '''jiao''' sacrifice to Heaven at the winter solstice, pay seasonal respects to soil and grain gods, offer incense in Confucius’s temple, and honor local deities when touring provinces. This fulfills what one scholar calls the “civil religion” role of Confucianism – providing a common '''moral framework''' – while allowing a spectrum of devotional practices to flourish beneath it &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Confucianism | Asia Society--&gt;https://asiasociety.org/education/confucianism#:~:text=foundation%20to%20establish%20the%20social,was%20the%20arena%20of%20religion&lt;/ref&gt;. Confucianism’s genius was precisely in offering '''ethical overcoding''' (imposing a unified moral order) *without* theological exclusivity. There was simply no Confucian notion that “all gods but one are false.” Instead, all gods that encouraged virtue, order, or community loyalty could be acknowledged as culturally useful. This openness paved the way for the next waves of thought, Daoism and Buddhism, to be integrated rather than obliterated.

## Daoist Metaphysics: Embracing the Mysterious Many

Parallel to the Confucian rationalization of ritual, '''Daoist''' (Taoist) thought emerged as another major stream reinforcing Chinese pluralism. If Confucianism represented the official ethos of order, '''Daoism''' embodied a more mystical and nature-oriented outlook – one that was inherently '''anti-dogmatic''' and comfortable with multiplicity. Early philosophical Daoism (5th–3rd centuries BCE, associated with texts like the *Laozi* (Tao Te Ching) and *Zhuangzi*) explicitly '''refuted''' the idea that there must be one correct *dao* (Way) for everyone &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Taoism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/Fall2006 Edition)--&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archIves/fall2006/entries/taoism/#:~:text=Both%20pluralist%20and%20primitivist%20Daoism,order%20dao&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Taoism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/Fall2006 Edition)--&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archIves/fall2006/entries/taoism/#:~:text=Zhuangzi%27s%20pluralism%20does%20undermine%20the,Zhuangzi%27s%20stance&lt;/ref&gt;. The Dao, as described by Laozi, is an ineffable process underlying the cosmos – “the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao.” This foundational Daoist idea resists any fixed, unitary coding of truth. Daoist sages argued that human interpretations of the Dao are many and relative; no single doctrine can grasp the '''whole'''. The '''Zhuangzi''', in particular, delights in demonstrating the limits of any one perspective. It portrays different beings (humans, animals, even fantastical creatures) each seeing the world in their own way – and suggests all these viewpoints have validity within the larger Dao. As the *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy* notes, Zhuangzi’s '''pluralism''' undermined the common assumption (held by Confucians and their rivals the Mohists) that “proper order was achieved only when a society followed a single dao” &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Taoism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/Fall2006 Edition)--&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archIves/fall2006/entries/taoism/#:~:text=Zhuangzi%27s%20pluralism%20does%20undermine%20the,Zhuangzi%27s%20stance&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, Daoism taught that the '''natural order''' accommodates diversity: “The social world survives as well (or better) when people follow different ways of life” &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Taoism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/Fall2006 Edition)--&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archIves/fall2006/entries/taoism/#:~:text=Both%20pluralist%20and%20primitivist%20Daoism,order%20dao&lt;/ref&gt;. This perspectival thinking prevented the rise of any dogmatic “One Truth” in Chinese philosophy – a sharp contrast to the Near Eastern trajectory where prophets and priests increasingly insisted on '''one true God, one true Law'''.

Over time, Daoism also developed religious institutions (often termed *Religious Daoism* to distinguish from the early philosophy). By the late Han dynasty (2nd century CE), organized Daoist movements like the '''Way of the Celestial Masters''' had formed, complete with rites, scriptures, and pantheons of deities. Far from becoming monolithic, Daoism cultivated an '''ever-expanding pantheon'''. Daoist cosmology envisioned multiple heavens populated by innumerable immortals, gods, and spirits. It incorporated local tutelary deities, stellar divinities, and personifications of natural forces. Even '''Laozi''' himself was apotheosized as Lord Lao, and later tradition spoke of the “Three Pure Ones” – a trinity of highest Daoist gods – alongside a vast bureaucracy of lesser gods. Notably, this proliferation of deities did not provoke sectarian conflict with older ancestral or Confucian rites; instead, it layered onto them. A village in medieval China might simultaneously maintain a Confucian-style ancestral hall, a Daoist temple to the local mountain god, and a shrine for Buddhist Bodhisattvas – all without a sense of contradiction. This was possible because Daoist theology was '''cosmologically inclusive'''. It did not demand a single Creator or a single path to salvation. The '''Dao''' itself was seen as too all-encompassing to be limited to one image. As one comparative study summarizes, “philosophical Daoism tends toward pluralism, perspectivalism, skepticism, political equality and freedom,” in contrast to traditions that impose one hegemonic truth &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Taoism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/Fall2006 Edition)--&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archIves/fall2006/entries/taoism/#:~:text=base%2C%20philosophical%20Daoism%20tends%20toward,As%20the%20special&lt;/ref&gt;. The *Zhuangzi* even jokes that from the perspective of the Dao, concepts like good/bad or god/devil are just *relative* – so how could one ever insist on a sole god for all? 

Daoist metaphysics also fostered an attitude of '''“live and let live”''' toward other beliefs. A Daoist might see other religious practices as just different people following their own *dao*, all of which ultimately partake in the Great Dao. This spirit is captured in later folklore like the story of the '''Three Laughs at Tiger Brook''', where a Confucian, a Buddhist, and a Daoist sage meet and laugh together upon realizing the unity of their different paths. Such tales reflect the deeply ingrained idea that the '''Three Teachings''' (Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism) are simply three expressions of one cosmic truth – a notion commonly phrased as “'''Three Teachings harmonious as one'''” &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Three teachings - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_teachings#:~:text=The%20phrase%20also%20appears%20as,2&lt;/ref&gt;. Importantly, this harmony was not achieved by '''erasing''' differences (as monotheistic syncretism often does by subsuming other gods into one) but by '''acknowledging''' and balancing differences. The Daoist contribution here was its '''cosmological openness''': since Dao transcends naming, no single doctrine can claim monopoly, leaving ample room for many gods and ways within the larger tapestry.

## Buddhism’s Peaceful Syncretism in China

The pluralistic fabric of Chinese religion was further enriched (and tested) when '''Buddhism''' entered China in the first century CE. Buddhism began in India as a non-theistic philosophy – centered on the Four Noble Truths and liberation from suffering – and it developed its own cosmologies and devotional practices. One might expect a foreign religion with distinct doctrines of karma, rebirth, and nirvana to clash with indigenous beliefs. Indeed, at times there were points of tension (for example, Buddhism’s renunciation of the family life seemed to conflict with Confucian filial piety). Yet, remarkably, Buddhism was '''absorbed and transformed''' in China through a gradual process of '''syncretism'''. Rather than displacing the older traditions, it blended with them, yielding uniquely Chinese forms of Buddhism that coexisted alongside Confucian and Daoist practices.

Several factors allowed Buddhism to integrate without enforcing exclusive claims. First, Buddhism as carried along the Silk Road was predominantly '''Mahayana''' Buddhism, which is expansive and inclusive in spirit. Mahayana teaching holds that there are countless Buddhas and Bodhisattvas working for the salvation of all beings – a view quite compatible with China’s idea of numerous enlightened or immortal figures. Chinese Buddhists did not insist that the Buddha was the *only* deity; in fact, they often didn’t regard Buddhas as gods at all, but as enlightened teachers or cosmic principles. This meant Buddhism could '''add''' to the pantheon (e.g. images of Amitabha Buddha or Guanyin were added to temples) rather than demanding the destruction of existing gods. Indeed, many Chinese identified '''Guanyin''' (Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion) with attributes of older female deities and even local mother-goddess figures, making her a beloved figure in popular worship without any doctrinal war on other faiths.

Second, Buddhism made deliberate efforts to '''accommodate''' Chinese values. The doctrine of '''filial piety''' was woven into Buddhist stories (e.g. the tale of Maitreya Buddha’s past life as a filial son), and monasteries often participated in community rituals that honored ancestors. Far from telling Chinese to abandon ancestor worship in favor of a new god, Buddhist monks often performed ceremonies to bless ancestors in the afterlife, thus complementing Confucian duties. Over centuries, the ideal emerged that a truly wise person would honor *all three* teachings: govern society with Confucian ethics, attain personal insight through Daoist-like contemplation, and seek spiritual salvation via Buddhist practices. By the '''Tang dynasty''' (618–907 CE), this attitude was common. An oft-cited maxim was “San Jiao Yi Jia” – *the Three Teachings are one family*. Emperors themselves would patronize all three: for instance, Tang Taizong honored Confucius, claimed Laozi as an ancestor (legend held Laozi’s surname Li was the imperial clan’s forebear), and sponsored Buddhist temples. One visual symbol of this unity was the construction of sites like the '''Hanging Temple''' (Xuankong Si) in Shanxi, which famously enshrined statues of the Buddha, Laozi, and Confucius together in one complex &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hanging Temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Temple#:~:text=%2A%20Wufo%20Hall%20,5&lt;/ref&gt;. In its Hall of Three Religions, the images of Śakyamuni (the Buddha), Lao-tzu, and Confucius sit side by side on the altar – an embodiment of the idea that these three wisdoms jointly uphold China’s cosmic and social order &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hanging Temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Temple#:~:text=%2A%20Wufo%20Hall%20,5&lt;/ref&gt;.

 &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--image--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; *The Hanging Temple in Datong, China, exemplifies imperial-era religious pluralism. Built into a cliff, this temple (started in the 6th century CE) enshrines Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian figures together. In its main hall, statues of the Buddha (center), Laozi (left), and Confucius (right) are worshipped side by side, reflecting the Ming-Qing dynasty notion of “Three Teachings Harmonious as One” &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hanging Temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Temple#:~:text=%2A%20Wufo%20Hall%20,5&lt;/ref&gt;. Such sites underscore how Chinese civilization integrated multiple faiths under one cultural roof, rather than enforcing a single orthodox creed.*

To be sure, Buddhism at times enjoyed imperial favor at the expense of Daoism or vice versa, and there were occasional persecutions (e.g. Emperor Wuzong’s brief suppression of Buddhism in 845 CE). But even these were '''political and economic''' measures (aimed at curbing monastic wealth or foreign influence) rather than attempts to establish a '''religious monopoly'''. No Chinese ruler ever tried to declare Buddha as the *only* god and banish all others, the way Roman emperors eventually outlawed pagan worship after adopting Christianity &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=Rome%27s%20intellectual%20elite%20such%20as,became%20the%20official%20state%20religion&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, at most we see periods of *relative* preference: e.g. the '''Song dynasty''' (960–1279) re-emphasized Confucianism (in the form of Neo-Confucian philosophy) as the guiding ideology, leading to Buddhism and Daoism being somewhat less fashionable at court &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Three teachings - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_teachings#:~:text=Buddhism%2C%20and%20Taoism%20have%20been,discriminated%20against%2C%20or%20tolerated%20at&lt;/ref&gt;. But they were still '''tolerated''' and continued to flourish among the populace. In fact, Neo-Confucianism itself absorbed Buddhist and Daoist ideas (such as '''Li'''理 principle and '''Qi'''氣 vital energy) into a new synthesis – again demonstrating the Chinese tendency to '''merge and balance''' rather than to eradicate. Scholars have pointed out that each of the three traditions had its role: “Confucianism was the ideology of the law, institutions and ruling class; Taoism was the worldview of the radical intellectuals and…compatible with the spiritual beliefs of the peasants and artisans. The two…jointly created the Chinese ‘image of the world’” &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Three teachings - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_teachings#:~:text=While%20Confucianism%20was%20the%20ideology,4&lt;/ref&gt;, to which we must add Buddhism as another layer that provided solace about suffering and hope for enlightenment. This functional differentiation meant there was '''room for all''' – a stark contrast to societies where church and state tried to make one faith all-encompassing.

## The Imperial State as Guardian of Pluralism

A key reason China avoided monotheistic overcoding is that the '''imperial state''' took on the role of arbiter among religious forces, rather than champion of one. From the Han dynasty onward, Chinese emperors styled themselves as the '''Son of Heaven''' (Tianzi), responsible for maintaining harmony between Heaven, Earth, and humankind. In practice, this meant performing elaborate '''state rituals''' to honor various cosmic entities. The emperor annually sacrificed to '''Heaven and Earth''' at the Temple of Heaven and Temple of Earth, offered seasonal rites to the sun and moon, ceremonially ploughed a sacred furrow to thank the agriculture deities, and led rites for ancestors and patron sages. Crucially, the imperial court oversaw a '''bureaucracy of rites''' that managed all these ceremonies – a secular administration of the sacred, if you will. By institutionalizing worship of '''many''' objects (Heaven, Earth, ancestors, etc.) as state functions, the Chinese Empire *institutionalized pluralism*. No single priesthood could gain exclusive power because ritual power was distributed across different cults and ministries.

The establishment of the '''Ministry of Rites''' (Lǐbu 礼部) under the Tang dynasty exemplifies this principle. This Ministry was one of the Six Ministries of government, and it was charged with managing *all* court rituals and sacrifices, as well as the registration of Buddhist and Daoist clergy &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Ministry of Rites - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Rites#:~:text=&lt;/ref&gt;. In effect, the Ministry of Rites acted as a regulator ensuring that religious practice supported social order but never veered into independent theocratic authority. For instance, it supervised the exams for '''state-sponsored monks''' and Daoist priests, curbing any single sect from claiming autonomy. It also handled foreign tributes and the reception of '''foreign religions''' (e.g. it would oversee how Nestorian Christians or Muslims were allowed to settle and build places of worship in certain periods). The very existence of such a ministry highlights that the '''state, not a church''', held the mandate to define acceptable religious expressions. Unlike in medieval Europe – where the Church could excommunicate a king or dictate orthodoxy – in China the state absorbed religious roles and thus kept any one doctrine from monopolizing the public sphere.

Moreover, Chinese law, influenced by Confucian values, generally did not prosecute people for '''belief''' as long as outward behavior (loyalty, filial piety, paying taxes, etc.) conformed. Heresy per se was not a common charge; instead, the government acted against religious groups primarily when they became '''rebellious''' or socially disruptive (for example, millenarian sects like the Yellow Turbans in the 2nd century or White Lotus in later times). Thus, unorthodox sects were suppressed for political security, not for theological deviation. The everyday religious life of the Chinese people – which often included '''mixing practices''' from Buddhism, Daoism, and folk ritual – was usually left alone or even encouraged as long as it promoted local morality and stability. This imperial stance can be summed up as '''pragmatic pluralism''': multiple cults were allowed and patronized to foster loyalty and moral conduct, whereas exclusivist fervor (the kind that might lead to iconoclasm or sectarian violence) was viewed with suspicion. 

Historically, when monotheistic religions did arrive in China, they had to '''adapt to this environment'''. For example, during the Ming dynasty, Catholic Jesuits attempted to introduce Christianity. The Ming emperors were curious about Western science and appreciated Jesuit knowledge, but they were uncomfortable with Christianity’s exclusive truth claims (such as opposition to ancestor worship). Matteo Ricci, the famous Jesuit, astutely presented Christianity in Confucian-friendly terms – referring to God as *Shangdi* (the old term for High Sovereign) and even arguing that the ancient Chinese indeed worshipped the same Supreme Being. However, the very need for this adaptation underscored how entrenched pluralism was: any religion insisting on sole worship would seem *alien* to Chinese sensibilities and statecraft. Indeed, later Qing emperors banned Christian missions partly because they saw Christians refusing to partake in the broader ritual life (like making offerings to ancestors or the Emperor’s image) – a refusal that smacked of '''disloyalty''' in the Chinese context. In China, to *not* honor the plurality of duties (to family, emperor, Heaven, and so on) was subversive.

To draw a vivid contrast: in the late Roman Empire, once '''Christianity''' gained imperial favor, it rather quickly went from being one cult among many to declaring itself the '''only true faith''' – culminating in Emperor Theodosius’s decree in 380 CE that made Nicene Christianity the state religion and outlawed pagan worship &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=Rome%27s%20intellectual%20elite%20such%20as,became%20the%20official%20state%20religion&lt;/ref&gt;. The Roman paradigm thus shifted from pluralism to monotheistic overcoding within a few generations. Similarly, in Sassanian Persia, '''Zoroastrianism''' was elevated to state creed; while Zoroastrianism isn’t strictly monotheistic in a Western sense (it’s dualist with Ahura Mazda as supreme good), the Sassanids enforced it to the exclusion of other cults, and non-Zoroastrians faced pressure or persecution &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Zoroastrianism--&gt;https://www.history.com/topics/religion/zoroastrianism#:~:text=Zoroastrianism%20is%20an%20ancient%20Persian,parts%20of%20Iran%20and%20India&lt;/ref&gt;. In China, no comparable moment occurred where one religion “won” and others were stamped out. Even the strongly Confucian '''neo-orthodoxy''' of the Song-Ming period did not stop emperors from praying at Daoist shrines or prevent the populace from worshipping Buddhas. The state’s role as '''ritual manager''' meant it could incorporate whatever useful symbols and rites were needed, rather than promote a single jealous god. The result was an imperial order that, as historian Benjamin Elman quipped, had “'''gods and spirits of all under Heaven'''” on its registry, much like it had peoples of all under Heaven under its rule.

## Resisting “Overcoding”: The Deleuzian View

The French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari offer a useful concept to analyze China’s avoidance of monotheism. They speak of '''“overcoding”''' – a process by which a central authority (a despotic state or a dominant signifier) imposes one code of meaning over all others &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Why Deleuze (still) matters | The Anarchist Library--&gt;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/andrew-robinson-why-deleuze-still-matters#:~:text=defined%20by%20the%20processes%20or,In%20contrast%20to%20the%20deep&lt;/ref&gt;. Monotheism is an archetypal case of overcoding in the religious sphere: one God, one scripture, one set of laws come to reinterpret or suppress the myriad local gods and cults. In their work *A Thousand Plateaus*, Deleuze and Guattari note that a defining feature of the '''state-form''' is to elevate a '''Master Signifier''' (for instance, the One God, or the Emperor as divine) that stands for the whole and marginalizes other sources of value &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Why Deleuze (still) matters | The Anarchist Library--&gt;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/andrew-robinson-why-deleuze-still-matters#:~:text=defined%20by%20the%20processes%20or,In%20contrast%20to%20the%20deep&lt;/ref&gt;. The '''“despotic signifier”''' – say a single deity – makes all meaning revolve around itself, and “overcoding consists in the imposition of the regime of meanings” of that one sign on all social interactions &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Why Deleuze (still) matters | The Anarchist Library--&gt;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/andrew-robinson-why-deleuze-still-matters#:~:text=defined%20by%20the%20processes%20or,In%20contrast%20to%20the%20deep&lt;/ref&gt;. In a monotheistic empire, this might translate to reorganizing society so that worship of the one God penetrates every community, and any ritual not sanctioned by that God’s law is deemed illegitimate. Historically, we can see this in actions like the smashing of idols, the conversion of temples into churches, the outlawing of heterodox rituals – all ways of *destroying or absorbing* the old codes that don’t fit the One.

What makes the Chinese case fascinating is that although China certainly had a powerful centralized state (arguably an even more ancient and bureaucratically effective one than Rome or Persia), it '''resisted deploying a monotheistic overcode''' in religion. The Chinese state did practice cultural “coding” – for instance, through Confucian ethics taught via state schools and exams – but this coding remained '''multiplicious'''. We might say the Chinese state overcoded *politics* (by making the Emperor the sole source of authority) but *under-coded* religion, allowing a high degree of local and sectarian variation. The Emperor was the Son of Heaven, yes, but Heaven in China was not a jealous monotheistic God that negated others; Heaven’s sons (the emperors) were explicitly supposed to also honor a whole array of subordinate spirits. In one intriguing sense, the Chinese state even '''prevented''' overcoding by co-opting any potentially absolutist creed. When Buddhism – which in theory posits ultimate truths (Dharma) that could override worldly authority – arrived, the state managed it by both control and syncretism. Emperors might claim the title of '''“Wheel-Turning King”''' (Chakravartin) supporting Buddhism, but they also expected Buddhist monks to pray for the dynasty’s well-being and acknowledge the primacy of imperial law. No single religious institution could stand apart and demand exclusive loyalty – certainly not on the scale of, say, the Papacy in medieval Europe. 

The result was a kind of '''anti-overcoding''' equilibrium. Diversity of belief was not only tolerated but cultivated as a source of strength. As Deleuze and Guattari suggest in a different context, a “rhizomatic” system (one with many centers of growth) is harder to capture by a despotic signifier than a unified tree-like system &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--On the Dialectical Relationship between Primitive Societies and ...--&gt;https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=123721#:~:text=,Deleuze%20%26%20Guattari%2C&lt;/ref&gt;. Chinese religion, with its rhizome of local cults, lineage rites, monastic traditions, and philosophical schools, never allowed itself to be entirely “treeified” under one doctrine. Even the Chinese language lacked a native term for “religion” as separate from culture until modern times – the various practices were just part of '''custom''' or '''Dao''' (Way). In a sense, the '''rhizome''' of Chinese spirituality ensured that whenever one branch started to dominate, the others would adapt and reassert balance.

Why did China never produce a home-grown monotheism? Scholars cite several factors: 

- '''Institutional balance:''' The early emergence of a bureaucratic state that claimed the *Mandate of Heaven* meant that no '''prophet figure''' could supersede the throne. In Israel or Arabia, prophets could challenge kings by invoking a higher God; in China, anyone claiming a new exclusive god would be seen as a rebel against the socio-political order (and usually treated as such). Thus, new religious ideas had to work *with* the existing plural order, not replace it. 

- '''Cultural emphasis on harmony:''' Chinese philosophy, from Yi Jing divination to Confucian ethics, stressed *harmony and equilibrium*. Extremes were cautioned against. Monotheism, which divides the world starkly into true vs. false gods, believers vs. infidels, was culturally too '''radical'''. A Confucian dictum might say: “Harmony (和) is the most precious.” This predisposed Chinese society to seek '''synthesis''' of viewpoints rather than exclusion. The very positive value placed on *he和* (harmonious blending) meant multiple teachings could be seen as complementary flavors rather than mutually exclusive. 

- '''No axial-age trauma:''' Some scholars argue that monotheism arises out of profound social trauma or moral crisis (e.g. the exilic period for Jews, or the messianic age of early Christians under Roman oppression). China, despite turmoil, maintained a strong continuity of civilization. The absence of a '''devastating civilizational collapse''' or conquest that delegitimized all previous gods (comparable to the Jewish exile or the fall of Rome) might have removed the impetus for a revolutionary monotheistic movement. Even when dynasties fell, the incoming rulers usually portrayed it as Heaven’s will transferring mandate, not as Heaven declaring all past rituals void.

- '''Philosophical realism:''' Chinese thinkers tended to be *this-worldly* and pragmatic. They were interested in how to '''live well and govern well''' here-and-now. Abstract theology about the one true God or the afterlife was not their priority. When such questions did arise (as with Buddhism’s metaphysics), they were integrated into existing frameworks (Neo-Confucian cosmology borrowed much from Buddhist ideas of principle and psychic energy, for instance). This philosophical flexibility kept the '''ultimate questions''' open-ended, rather than answered by one revelation.

In light of Deleuze and Guattari’s ideas, we could say the Chinese imperial system performed a kind of '''controlled coding''': it set general parameters (loyalty to emperor, performance of filial and public rites) but allowed a '''play of differences''' within those parameters. The “despotic signifier” of the Chinese state was perhaps the Emperor or the imperial law itself, not a deity – and even that signifier did not seek to micromanage personal belief. As long as subjects were *ritually obedient*, their inner cosmologies could remain diverse. Thus, China achieved what D&amp;G might call a line of flight from the typical despotic trap: it harnessed religion to politics without crushing diversity, and it harnessed diversity to politics without losing order.

## Conclusion: Pluralism as Political Virtue

The story of Chinese religion is, in sum, one of '''unity without uniformity'''. Over more than three millennia, China maintained a civilizational coherence not through a one-God, one-book theology, but through a '''shared ritual culture''' that could accommodate polytheism, pantheism, and even bits of monotheism (like the abstract Heaven) without succumbing to the rule of '''One'''. This stands as an optimistic model in comparative political theory and philosophy of religion. It suggests that a complex society can achieve stability and moral order while '''embracing multiplicity''' – that exclusive monotheism is not an inevitable pinnacle of religious “progress” but a particular path with its own perils (intolerance, dogmatism, the tragic flattening of the sacred landscape). China’s alternative path was to let a hundred spirits bloom under the care of a rational state gardener.

By avoiding monotheistic overcoding, Chinese civilization perhaps also avoided some of the internecine religious conflicts that haunted the West and Middle East. There were no Chinese equivalents of the Crusades or Europe’s wars of religion fought over doctrine. This is not to romanticize China’s past – religious sects could be harshly suppressed if seen as seditious, and some dynasties were less tolerant than others – but overall, the '''principle of pluralism''' prevailed. The late imperial notion of '''“Three Teachings Harmonious as One”''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hanging Temple - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Temple#:~:text=%2A%20Wufo%20Hall%20,5&lt;/ref&gt; epitomizes this achievement: rather than reduce the cosmic mystery to a single voice, China orchestrated a '''chorus''' of voices in dialog. 

In an era where modern states grapple with pluralism, the Chinese historical experience offers a compelling case study. It shows that political unity need not require '''theological uniformity'''. On the contrary, the Chinese state derived much of its resilience from its ability to adapt to new faiths and absorb them. As the 20th-century philosopher Karl Jaspers noted, the axial-age sages (including Confucius and Laozi) each illuminated different facets of human spiritual potential. China was uniquely able to '''keep the lights of multiple sages on''' simultaneously. In doing so, it provided a living example of how '''cosmic multiplicity''' can be preserved within a single world-empire. The avoidance of monotheistic overcoding in China was not an accident, but the result of deliberate values – harmony, tolerance, respect for antiquity – and institutions that favored '''ritual ecumenism''' over zealotry. This legacy invites us to imagine forms of governance and culture today that might similarly resist the impulse to collapse plurality into a single ideological '''One''', fostering instead an environment where many truths can coexist in mutual enrichment.

      <text bytes="39807" sha1="4632fmd4qe0z0t304uzgszahbfjvv4g" xml:space="preserve">Great — I’ll begin in-depth research on how religion evolved in the classical world, focusing on both Greece and Rome. This will include:

1. The transformation of indigenous Roman religion through Greco-Roman syncretism and the eventual marginalization of early Roman deities.
2. The influence of Greek philosophical traditions — particularly Platonism, Neoplatonism, and Stoicism — on religious thought, culminating in their intersections with early Christian theology.
3. A study of resistance and continuity of non-Christian religious practices and schools (e.g., mystery religions, Neoplatonist cults) into the late Roman Empire and early Christian era.

I’ll prioritize cultic, ideological, and philosophical developments and present the findings in a structured format for your chapter.

# Evolution of Greco-Roman Religion from Polytheism to Christianity

## Indigenous Roman Religion and Greco-Roman Syncretism  
 &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--image--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; '''Civic Polytheism:''' Early Roman religion was a polytheistic system deeply integrated with the city’s social and political life. Worship was communal and focused on securing the '''pax deorum''' (“peace of the gods”) through correct ritual performance rather than personal belief or doctrine &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Historiography of the Christianization of the Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_the_Christianization_of_the_Roman_Empire#:~:text=Religion%20in%20Graeco,31&lt;/ref&gt;. Public rites and festivals were conducted by state priests and magistrates (often the same individuals), reflecting how politics and religion were inseparable – for example, elected officials like consuls performed sacrifices, and high-ranking politicians held priestly offices (the emperor himself assumed the title *Pontifex Maximus*, chief priest) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Historiography of the Christianization of the Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_the_Christianization_of_the_Roman_Empire#:~:text=Religion%20in%20Graeco,31&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=Under%20the%20rule%20of%20Augustus%2C,105&lt;/ref&gt;. Respect for ancestral custom ('''mos maiorum''') guided these cultic practices, and participation in civic rituals – from household offerings to major state sacrifices – was expected of all citizens as a duty to the community and its gods &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Historiography of the Christianization of the Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_the_Christianization_of_the_Roman_Empire#:~:text=the%20individual%20but%20was%20focused,31&lt;/ref&gt;. 

'''Cultic Practices and Institutions:''' Roman religious practice centered on formal rituals, temples, and priestly colleges rather than scriptures or theology. Priests (such as the '''pontifices''' and '''augurs''') oversaw the calendar of festivals and divination rites, while the '''Vestal Virgins''' tended the sacred hearth of Rome. Sacrifices – of animals, wine, or incense – were offered to honor the gods and secure their favor on behalf of the city. These acts followed strict protocols (e.g. specific sacrificial animals for specific deities, accompanied by prayers and libations) and exemplified the Roman principle of '''do ut des''' (“I give that you may give”) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=In%20Latin%2C%20the%20word%20sacrificium,principle%20of%20do%20ut%20des&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=The%20most%20potent%20offering%20was,44&lt;/ref&gt;. Such rituals were civic events as much as religious ones: attending public sacrifices, games, and processions affirmed one’s identity as a Roman citizen. Notably, Roman religion was highly '''inclusive''' – rather than enforcing an exclusive creed, it allowed multiple gods and cults to coexist as long as they did not disrupt public order. This inclusivity set the stage for syncretism as Rome’s power expanded.

'''Greco-Roman Syncretism:''' As Rome came into contact with other cultures, especially the Greeks, its religious landscape evolved through '''syncretism''', the blending and identification of deities across cultures. The Romans equated their indigenous gods with Greek ones (Jupiter with Zeus, Venus with Aphrodite, etc.), absorbing Greek mythology and iconography into Roman cult. Over time, “Greek religious beliefs began to merge with Roman practices” forming a combined Greco-Roman pantheon &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Evolution of Roman Religion - From Polytheism to Christianity--&gt;https://roman-empire.net/religion/evolution-of-roman-religion-from-polytheism-to-christianity#:~:text=empire,characterized%20Rome%27s%20evolving%20religious%20landscape&lt;/ref&gt;. This process was facilitated by Rome’s openness to adopt foreign gods: as one scholar notes, Roman religion “willingly adopted foreign gods and practices” – as the Republic and Empire expanded, Romans encountered local deities in Italy, Gaul, the Near East, and beyond, and often '''identified or integrated them''' into Roman worship &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Historiography of the Christianization of the Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_the_Christianization_of_the_Roman_Empire#:~:text=Roman%20historians%2C%20such%20as%20the,33&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, the Italic gods of fields and springs were likened to Greek divinities, and the cult of '''Apollo''' or '''Dionysus''' found its way into Rome. Such adoption was often deliberate policy: the Senate sometimes imported foreign cults in times of crisis (a famous case being the Magna Mater (Cybele) from Anatolia in 204 BC). By the imperial era, '''dozens of cults''' of Egyptian, Persian, and other origin flourished in Rome alongside the old state religion.

'''Transformation of Cultic Traditions:''' Greco-Roman syncretism both enriched and transformed Roman religion. Indigenous cults were not so much abolished as '''reinterpreted or assimilated'''. The traditional Roman gods gained new attributes and stories under Greek influence, while new deities gained official recognition. The result was an expanding pantheon where Jupiter–Zeus reigned atop, but many local gods found a place. In the provinces, this often meant a fusion of Roman and native traditions: provincial cities might build a temple to Jupiter Optimus Maximus in the style of the Capitoline Temple, yet also continue venerating local gods under Roman names &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=Romanisation%20offered%20distinct%20political%20and,choice%2C%20not%20a%20centralised%20legal&lt;/ref&gt;. For instance, in Gaul, a local war god might be worshipped as '''Mars''' with a Celtic epithet, and at '''Sabratha''' in Africa a temple of the Roman Capitoline Triad was erected beside the sanctuary of Punic/Libyan deities like '''Liber Pater''' and '''Serapis''', symbolizing religious '''co-existence and fusion''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=Latin%2C%20Etruscan%20and%20other%20Italian,the%20middle%20of%20the%201st&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=century%20AD%2C%20Gaulish%20Vertault%20,172&lt;/ref&gt;. Over the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, many native rituals gradually shifted to Roman models – one archaeological example is that a Gallic site abandoned the sacrifice of horses and dogs (a native practice) in favor of more classical Roman forms of worship &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=Romanisation%20offered%20distinct%20political%20and,choice%2C%20not%20a%20centralised%20legal&lt;/ref&gt;. At the same time, popular “oriental” cults such as the '''Egyptian Isis''' and the Persian '''Mithras''' gained adherents across the Empire, sometimes displacing older Latin cults in people’s devotion (Isis, for instance, became a beloved goddess in Rome by the early Empire, with temples on the Campus Martius). By accommodating such cults, Roman religion became increasingly '''pluralistic'''. By the late Empire, religious life was highly variegated: a citizen might offer sacrifices in the civic temple, observe local rites, and also be an initiate in a mystery cult – a diversity that marked a departure from the old republican uniformity. Importantly, this pluralism also meant that religious identity started to '''separate from civic identity''', as individuals pursued personal spiritual paths that were not strictly tied to being a Roman citizen &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Historiography of the Christianization of the Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_the_Christianization_of_the_Roman_Empire#:~:text=pantheon%20%20meant%20that%2C%20as,33&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Historiography of the Christianization of the Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_the_Christianization_of_the_Roman_Empire#:~:text=,33&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''The Imperial Cult:''' One of the most significant institutional innovations was the rise of the '''imperial cult''' – the veneration of the emperors (and their family members) as divine figures. This began with the deification of Julius Caesar and the establishment by Augustus of the cult of '''Divus Iulius''', and of '''Roma et Augustus''' in the provinces. Emperors were often officially deified by the Senate upon death, and throughout the Empire people worshipped the genius (spirit) of the living emperor at altars and temples. Initially a form of political loyalty, the imperial cult took on genuine religious depth over time. Emperors like Augustus and his successors actively promoted traditional religion (Augustus restored temples and priesthoods and positioned himself as a pious restorer of ancestral rites &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=the%20office%20of%20pontifex%20maximus,the%20Vestals%20as%20a%20visible&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=restoration%20of%20Roman%20morality.,and%20social%20duty%20of%20emperors&lt;/ref&gt;), and in turn received '''divine honors'''. Modern scholarship notes that the imperial cult was not merely a cynical political tool but also a '''sincere religious phenomenon''', framing the emperor as an '''intermediary between the human and the divine''' in the Roman worldview &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Historiography of the Christianization of the Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_the_Christianization_of_the_Roman_Empire#:~:text=twenty,42&lt;/ref&gt;. The Emperor’s well-being was thought to ensure the prosperity of the empire, so cultic honors (prayers, sacrifices, temples) were offered to him. This development augmented the old religion with a new focus: loyalty to Rome itself became sacralized. In some respects, this '''displaced traditional cults''' – communal energy that once went solely into Jupiter’s or Mars’ worship now also included the Emperor’s cult. Yet emperors presented themselves as guardians of tradition, not rivals to the gods; Augustus famously claimed he was restoring ancient piety &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=acquired%20or%20was%20granted%20an,and%20social%20duty%20of%20emperors&lt;/ref&gt;. The imperial cult helped unify the Empire’s diverse peoples in a common ritual language of emperor-veneration, but it also paved the way for a more centralized religious authority – a role that would later be assumed by the Christian Church when emperors like Constantine aligned with Christianity.

## Philosophical Currents: Platonism, Stoicism, and Neoplatonism  
The Greco-Roman world not only experienced religious syncretism, but also profound '''philosophical transformations''' that influenced religious thought. Major schools of philosophy – particularly '''Platonism''', '''Stoicism''', and later '''Neoplatonism''' – offered new frameworks for understanding deity, cosmos, and the soul. These intellectual currents began in Classical Greece and continued to evolve under the Roman Empire, eventually shaping the theological language of Christianity.

'''Platonic Philosophy and Religion:''' '''Platonism''', originating with Plato (4th century BC), introduced a transcendent view of reality that would later resonate with monotheistic religion. Plato taught that beyond the visible world lies an eternal realm of '''Forms''' or Ideas, with the highest being the Form of the Good – an absolute principle often interpreted in quasi-divine terms. Middle Platonists (1st century BC–AD) further personified this concept, speaking of a highest God or *One*. Platonic thought emphasized the immortality of the soul and the goal of the soul’s return to the divine realm. These ideas encouraged seeing traditional gods allegorically or as lesser spirits under one supreme principle. By the time of the early Roman Empire, educated pagans often viewed the multitude of gods as manifestations of a single higher reality (a trend evident in authors like Plutarch and Cicero). This '''philosophical monotheism''' smoothed the path for Christian theology – early Christian thinkers found in Platonism a vocabulary to explain their one God. Indeed, Platonism remained “a decisive ingredient” in the thought of Church Fathers like Augustine of Hippo &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Augustine of Hippo - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy--&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#:~:text=Philosophy%20plato,philosopher%20of%20late%20antiquity&lt;/ref&gt;. It provided concepts such as an immaterial, highest God and the sharp dualism between spirit and matter, which helped articulate Christian ideas of an infinite Creator vs. creation.

'''Stoicism’s Influence:''' '''Stoicism''', a Hellenistic philosophy founded in the 3rd century BC, also left a strong mark on Roman religious thought and Christian ideals. The Stoics were essentially pantheists – they believed in a single divine *Logos* (Reason or Word) pervading the universe, a rational fire or spirit that orders all things. They identified this cosmic Logos with Zeus and taught that living according to reason (nature) was the highest virtue. Stoic philosophers like Seneca and Epictetus, who were widely read in the Roman Empire, emphasized ethics: virtue, self-control, duty, and brotherhood of all under one providence. These ethical teachings showed striking parallels with Christian morality, and it is “widely accepted that the Stoics had a decisive influence on historical Christian thought, particularly Christian ethics” &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Stoicism and Christian Ethics - St Andrews Encyclopaedia of Theology--&gt;https://www.saet.ac.uk/Christianity/StoicismandChristianEthics#:~:text=Elizabeth%20Agnew%20Cochran&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, Stoicism’s stress on inner virtue over external ritual resonated with Christian moral emphasis. Early Christians also borrowed Stoic terminology – most famously the concept of the '''Logos'''. In Stoic thought, Logos was the divine rational principle binding the cosmos, and the Gospel of John identifies Christ as the '''Logos''' made flesh. The 2nd-century apologist '''Justin Martyr''' explicitly used the Stoic concept of Logos as a bridge to explain Christianity: he argued to Greek audiences that the universal Reason (*Logos*) they philosophically revered is actually incarnate in Jesus Christ &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Logos (Christianity) - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos_(Christianity)#:~:text=In%20his%20First%20Apology%20%2C,25&lt;/ref&gt;. By doing so, he could claim that seeds of truth (“*logos spermatikos*”) were sown in philosophy and fulfilled in Christ &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Justin Martyr's View of the Greek Philosophers - David Duncombe--&gt;https://daveduncombe.wordpress.com/2012/01/12/justin-martyrs-view-of-the-greek-philosophers/#:~:text=Justin%20Martyr%27s%20View%20of%20the,when%20they%20assert&lt;/ref&gt;. Stoic ideas of natural law and conscience also informed Christian thought on ethics and law. However, Christians diverged from Stoicism on key points: Stoic materialism (the idea that even the soul and God are material) was rejected in favor of a transcendent, immaterial God, and Stoic fatalism was tempered by the Christian belief in free will and a personal God who intervenes in history &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Stoicism and Christian Ethics - St Andrews Encyclopaedia of Theology--&gt;https://www.saet.ac.uk/Christianity/StoicismandChristianEthics#:~:text=It%20is%20widely%20accepted%20that,thought%20and%20for%20contemporary%20Christian&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Neoplatonism and Early Christian Theology:''' By the 3rd century AD, Platonism had evolved into '''Neoplatonism''', a new philosophical movement (led by thinkers like '''Plotinus''' and '''Porphyry''') that systematized Plato’s ideas into a quasi-religious philosophy. Neoplatonism taught that reality emanates from a single ineffable Source, '''“the One,”''' proceeding through the Divine Mind (*Nous*) and World-Soul into the material world. The human soul’s goal was to ascend back toward the One through virtue and contemplative insight. This philosophy had mystical elements and even incorporated traditional gods as symbolic or intermediate beings (henads). Neoplatonism became enormously influential among the late-antique educated classes and '''“was a major influence on Christian theology throughout Late Antiquity”''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Neoplatonism and Christianity - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism_and_Christianity#:~:text=Neoplatonism%20%20was%20a%20major,East%2C%20the%20works%20of%20the&lt;/ref&gt;. Many early Christian theologians were educated in Greek philosophy and made conscious use of Neoplatonic concepts. For instance, '''Origen of Alexandria''' in the 3rd century and '''Augustine''' in the 4th-5th century drew on Platonic thought to articulate Christian doctrine &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Neoplatonism and Christianity - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism_and_Christianity#:~:text=Early%20Christians%20including%20Origen%20%2C,a%20privation%20of%20good%20and&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Neoplatonism and Christianity - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism_and_Christianity#:~:text=Christian%20%20%20289%20Augustine,of%20%27the%20books%20of%20the&lt;/ref&gt;. Augustine’s own spiritual journey illustrates this influence: as he recounts in his *Confessions*, reading “the books of the Platonists” (likely Neoplatonic works) helped him conceive of God as an incorporeal, supreme being and evil as not a substance but a '''privation of good''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Neoplatonism and Christianity - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism_and_Christianity#:~:text=Christian%20%20%20289%20Augustine,of%20%27the%20books%20of%20the&lt;/ref&gt;. These insights – clearly echoing Neoplatonic ideas – allowed Augustine to abandon the dualistic, materialistic theology of Manichaeism and embrace orthodox Christianity &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Neoplatonism and Christianity - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism_and_Christianity#:~:text=Early%20Christians%20including%20Origen%20%2C,importantly%2C%20the%20emphasis%20on%20mystical&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, Augustine’s formulation that *evil is the absence or privation of good* and that *God is immaterial and immutable* comes straight from Neoplatonic philosophy &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Neoplatonism and Christianity - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism_and_Christianity#:~:text=Christian%20%20%20289%20Augustine,of%20%27the%20books%20of%20the&lt;/ref&gt;. Likewise, the Neoplatonic emphasis on mystical union (the soul’s ascent to the One) informed Christian mysticism and theologies of divine contemplation. Eastern Christian Fathers (like '''Gregory of Nyssa''' and '''Pseudo-Dionysius''') also incorporated Neoplatonic ideas – '''Pseudo-Dionysius''' in the late 5th century famously adapted Proclus’s philosophy into a Christian mystical theology &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Neoplatonism and Christianity - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism_and_Christianity#:~:text=St,original%20work%20of%20%20281&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Neoplatonism and Christianity - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism_and_Christianity#:~:text=Plotinus%20%20and%20%2073,work%20of%20Dionysius%20the%20Areopagite&lt;/ref&gt;. The result of this cross-pollination was that by late antiquity, Christian doctrine about God’s nature, the structure of reality (e.g. hierarchy of angels, the soul’s journey), and even the language of '''Trinitarian dogma''' were all articulated with the help of Greek philosophical terms and concepts. Christianity, in effect, became the heir to the philosophical traditions of Platonism and Stoicism, even as the Church Fathers often insisted that divine revelation ultimately surpassed pagan philosophy. None of these thinkers adopted philosophy uncritically – they modified it to fit Christian revelation – but the '''conceptual scaffolding''' of Greco-Roman philosophy is unmistakable in early Christian theology &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Neoplatonism and Christianity - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism_and_Christianity#:~:text=Early%20Christians%20including%20Origen%20%2C,a%20privation%20of%20good%20and&lt;/ref&gt;. In sum, the long dialogue between Greek philosophy and Roman religion created an intellectual environment in which the new Christian faith could be explained and defended using familiar philosophical ideas of a highest God (Platonism), the divine Logos and moral law (Stoicism), and the soul’s return to God (Neoplatonism).

## Late Antiquity: Polytheistic Persistence and the Rise of Christianity  
By the 4th century AD, the religious landscape of the Roman Empire had changed dramatically. Christianity was on the rise – eventually becoming the state religion – but traditional polytheism did not vanish overnight. Instead, there was a '''gradual transformation and contest''' between old and new: public pagan cults were progressively restricted while new Christian institutions emerged, and devotees of classical religion either adapted, resisted, or found refuge in philosophy. This period saw old '''cultic practices''', '''mystery religions''', and the '''imperial cult''' persist in various forms, even as Christian theology and church organization took center stage.

 &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--File:Mithras tauroctony Louvre Ma3441b.jpg - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mithras_tauroctony_Louvre_Ma3441b.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; '''Mystery Religions and New Spirituality:''' One feature of later paganism was the popularity of '''mystery religions''' – cults offering initiates secret rites of purification, personal salvation, and a hope for blessed afterlife. These had existed since Greek times (e.g. the Eleusinian Mysteries of Demeter and Persephone) but grew especially widespread in the early Empire, fulfilling spiritual needs that the traditional state cult did not address. By late antiquity, many individuals sought religious *experience* and personal connection with the divine through mysteries. The cult of '''Mithras''' is a prime example: Mithraism was a mystery cult (especially popular among soldiers) in which members progressed through initiatory grades and partook in sacred meals. Its iconic symbol was Mithras *tauroctony* – the act of slaying a bull – as shown in reliefs found in underground Mithraic sanctuaries &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--File:Mithras tauroctony Louvre Ma3441b.jpg - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mithras_tauroctony_Louvre_Ma3441b.jpg#:~:text=English%3A%20%20CIMRM%20641%3A%20Side,The%20tail&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--File:Mithras tauroctony Louvre Ma3441b.jpg - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mithras_tauroctony_Louvre_Ma3441b.jpg#:~:text=de%20briques,24%20Image%3AMithras%20banquet%20Louvre&lt;/ref&gt;. In these rites (as in the image above), Mithras was revered as a savior god who guaranteed the initiate’s ascent to immortality. Similarly, the '''Egyptian Mysteries of Isis and Osiris''' promised eternal life through identification with the gods’ death and rebirth. By the 3rd century, such cults had spread throughout the Empire; a person in, say, 4th-century Rome might be simultaneously a devotee of Isis, a initiate in Mithras’s mysteries, and a participant in the public festivals of Jupiter. This *spiritual eclecticism* meant that when Christianity appeared, it was entering a diverse religious marketplace. In fact, scholars have noted that the mystery religions in some ways “paved the way” for Christianity by familiarizing people with concepts of personal salvation and sacraments &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--"The Influence of the Mystery Religions on Christianity" | The Martin ...--&gt;https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/influence-mystery-religions-christianity#:~:text=,the%20world%20of%20that%20time&lt;/ref&gt;. Unlike the old civic cults, the mysteries were voluntary and focused on the individual’s soul – a shift in religiosity that late polytheism and Christianity shared. Even after emperors began favoring Christianity, many of these cults persisted among the populace. Archaeologically, Mithraic sanctuaries (mithraea) and Isis temples show activity into the late 4th century in some regions, until they were gradually closed or converted under Christian rule. The appeal of the mysteries underscores that '''late polytheism had evolved''' from the outward civic formalism of the early Empire toward more '''personal, mystical forms of worship''', bridging the gap toward Christian forms of religiosity.

'''The Imperial Cult and Civic Polytheism in Late Empire:''' Traditional public religion – the festivals, sacrifices, and imperial cult – continued in the 4th century, but under increasing pressure. Emperors prior to Constantine (d. 337) had generally upheld the old cults; the '''imperial cult''' of the divine emperors was still a unifying institution. In the provinces, altars smoking with sacrifices to the '''Genius of the Emperor''' and the personified '''Goddess Roma''' were common into the early 300s. Even after Constantine’s conversion to Christianity, there were co-emperors and officials who remained pagan for a time, and the inertia of old practices meant they did not disappear immediately. The emperor was still hailed in traditional religious language – coins of even the Christian emperor Constantine depict the sun-god Sol (associated with the '''Sol Invictus''' cult that had imperial favor under Aurelian and Constantine himself in earlier years). However, the '''role of the Emperor in religion''' was changing. In 382 AD, Emperor '''Gratian''' famously '''refused the title of Pontifex Maximus''' (head of the pagan priesthoods) – breaking an ancient tradition – and ordered the removal of the '''Altar of Victory''' from the Senate House in Rome, a altar that symbolized Rome’s divine favor &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=match%20at%20L1979%20The%20Western,he%20officially%20adopted%20Nicene%20Christianity&lt;/ref&gt;. This act signaled that the Christian emperors no longer saw themselves as priests of the old religion. Still, many among the aristocracy clung to the ancestral cults: the '''Vestal Virgins''' continued tending Vesta’s flame in Rome until the 380s, when Gratian withdrew state funding, and in 394 the fire was extinguished by Theodosius’s decree &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religion in ancient Rome - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome#:~:text=Claudius%20%20appointed%20them%20as,fire%20and%20vacated%20her%20temple&lt;/ref&gt;. The '''Temple of Vesta''', the '''Temple of Jupiter''', and other shrines did not suddenly vanish – some remained nominally intact for years, though increasingly without official support. Pagan senators like '''Symmachus''' pleaded for the preservation of these traditions (Symmachus’s petition to restore the Altar of Victory in 384 is a famous last stand for paganism), but Christian leaders such as St. Ambrose successfully argued against them. By the late 4th century, legislation by '''Theodosius I''' (r. 379–395) outlawed public pagan sacrifices and closed many temples &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism#:~:text=,1%20Catastrophic%20view&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism#:~:text=,even%20without%20the%20conversion%20of&lt;/ref&gt;. This led to a swift decline in the '''institutional practice''' of the old cults: public sacrifices – once “a central rite of virtually all religious groups in the pre-Christian Mediterranean” – largely '''disappeared in late antiquity''', especially in urban centers &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism#:~:text=,even%20without%20the%20conversion%20of&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism#:~:text=according%20to%20any%20uniform%20pattern%2C,of%20the%20ancient%20rite%3F%20The&lt;/ref&gt;. Contemporary observers note that by about the time of '''Julian'''’s reign (360s), in many Eastern cities regular pagan sacrifices were no longer being held &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism#:~:text=significant%20religious%20developments%20of%20late,imagine%20a%20situation%20in%20which&lt;/ref&gt;. The disappearance was not entirely organic – it was hastened by the “atmosphere created by imperial and episcopal hostility” to pagan rites &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism#:~:text=pagan%20priesthoods%20and%20a%20shift,110&lt;/ref&gt;. In their place, Christian rituals (prayers, Eucharist, veneration of saints) filled the public sphere. Yet, it’s crucial to note that '''belief in the old gods did not vanish as quickly as the rituals'''. Many educated pagans shifted from temple worship to a more philosophical or symbolic reverence for the gods.

'''Neoplatonist Resistance and the Last Pagans:''' Even as the state suppressed public paganism, a passionate '''intellectual resistance''' endured among die-hard pagans, often centered in Neoplatonic philosophical circles. The most notable attempt to reverse Christianization came from Emperor '''Julian “the Apostate”''' (reigned 361–363), who had been raised Christian but reverted to pagan philosophy. Julian was a devotee of '''Neoplatonism''' and the mysteries – he was initiated into at least three mystery religions, including the Eleusinian and Mithraic rites &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism#:~:text=deepened%20when%20Constantius%20executed%20Julian%27s,97&lt;/ref&gt; – and upon becoming emperor he launched a project to restore '''Hellenic paganism''' as the Empire’s faith. Julian saw pagan religion through a philosophical lens: he promoted a kind of '''Neoplatonic Hellenism''' purified of what he viewed as superstition, attempting to give the old cults new life and intellectual coherence &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Julian (emperor) - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_(emperor)#:~:text=philosopher%20%20and%20author%20in,4&lt;/ref&gt;.

Julian’s short reign saw a flurry of pagan revival – contemporaries quipped that one could smell the sacrificial altars smoking again. However, the revival met with '''indifference or resistance''' in many quarters. Julian lamented that the old priesthoods were inept and that pagan charity lagged behind Christian charity; he tried to organize pagan priests to care for the poor and behave with the virtue Christians showed, in order to strengthen Hellenism &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism#:~:text=Provincial%20priests%20were%20replaced%20with,106&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism#:~:text=charitable%20institutions%2C%20he%20wrote%20to,106&lt;/ref&gt;. Still, the population by then had grown accustomed to Christian practices over two generations &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism#:~:text=overt%20compulsion%2C,98%20%5D%3A%2062&lt;/ref&gt;. In Antioch, when Julian restored sacrifices, the largely Christian populace mocked him as “the '''slaughterer''',” and altars he set up were quickly thrown down by Christian locals &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism#:~:text=Julian%20reached%20Antioch%20on%20July,109&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism#:~:text=their%20own%20past%20sufferings%20associated,109&lt;/ref&gt;. Julian’s top-down pagan revival failed to take root—his death in 363 ended the last real imperial support for polytheism. Subsequent emperors, even if personally pagan (e.g. some suggest *Eugenius* in 394 had pagan sympathies), could not turn back the tide and generally either tolerated paganism in decline or actively legislated against it.

After Theodosius I’s reign, '''open pagan worship largely vanished from the public sphere'''. Temples were either converted to churches or fell into disuse. Some famous sanctuaries met dramatic ends: the '''Serapeum of Alexandria''', a grand temple of Serapis, was destroyed by a Christian mob in 391, symbolizing the triumph of Christianity in the urban centers. Yet, '''pagan belief and philosophical practice persisted''' in pockets. In rural areas (the *pagani*, or country folk, which gave rise to the term “pagan”), old fertility rites, festivals, and polytheist devotions likely continued well into the 5th and 6th centuries, albeit increasingly syncretized with or hidden behind Christian forms. Meanwhile, a circle of Neoplatonist philosophers kept the flame of Hellenic religion alive in academic settings. Schools in '''Athens''' and '''Alexandria''' still taught Plato, Aristotle, and the old religious philosophy to pagan and Christian students alike. These philosophers – figures like '''Proclus''' in the 5th century – were pagan theologians in their own right, formulating elaborate metaphysical systems incorporating the Greek gods. They saw the '''traditional gods as metaphysical principles or emanations of the One''', and engaged in theurgy (rituals to invoke the gods) to achieve union with the divine. This can be seen as a transformation of polytheistic practice into a philosophical mysticism. The final chapter came in '''529 AD''', when the Byzantine emperor '''Justinian''' – a devout Christian – '''closed the Neoplatonic Academy in Athens''', effectively ending the last institutional bastion of the old religion &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Damascius | Greek Philosopher, Neoplatonism | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Damascius#:~:text=Greek%20Academy%20at%20Athens%20%2C,75%20about%20387%20bc&lt;/ref&gt;. Damascius, the last head of that Academy, and his colleagues went into exile, marking what many consider the definitive end of ancient Greek pagan tradition in the intellectual realm &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Damascius | Greek Philosopher, Neoplatonism | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Damascius#:~:text=A%20pupil%20and%20close%20friend,than%20at%20the%20Persian%20court&lt;/ref&gt;. From then on, open worship of the Olympian gods was extinct, and the Roman state that once patronized Jupiter and Mars now supported churches and monasteries.

'''Conclusion:''' Between the early imperial era and late antiquity, Greco-Roman religion underwent a sweeping evolution. The '''cultic and civic polytheism''' that had united the Roman Republic gave way to a richly '''syncretic and diverse religious world''' in the Empire, which in turn was gradually '''transformed or replaced by Christian institutions and belief'''. On the one hand, the continuity is striking: Roman religion’s adaptability allowed it to syncretize with Greek and Eastern traditions, and Greco-Roman philosophy provided concepts that seamlessly fed into Christian theology. On the other hand, the shift was revolutionary: by the end of late antiquity, the public altars were cold, the old temples repurposed, and the '''Christian Church''' – with its hierarchy, theology, and scriptures – had assumed the position of cultural dominance that traditional religion once held. This transition was neither simple nor sudden; it spanned centuries of gradual change, coexistence, and sometimes conflict. Civic rituals became church sacraments; the imperial cult was reinterpreted as emperors convening church councils and enforcing orthodoxy rather than receiving sacrifice; classical philosophy found new life as the handmaiden of Christian theology. Thus, the evolution from the '''polytheism of Jupiter and Juno to the monotheism of the Christian Trinity''' was a complex process of religious and philosophical transformation – a tapestry woven from cultic shifts, institutional changes, and intellectual continuities that defined the ancient Mediterranean’s journey into the era of Christianity.  

'''Sources:''' Historical and archaeological evidence for these changes comes from a wide array of scholarship – from temple remains and inscriptions showing the coexistence of cults, to edicts of Christian emperors preserved in the Theodosian Code, to the writings of Church Fathers and pagan philosophers themselves. Modern historians have used these sources to map how “religion embedded in the city-state” gave way to religion as a personal choice &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Historiography of the Christianization of the Roman Empire - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_the_Christianization_of_the_Roman_Empire#:~:text=Roman%20historians%2C%20such%20as%20the,in%20other%20identities%2C%20needs%20and&lt;/ref&gt;, and how ultimately the old gods “failed” not simply due to state suppression but because the populace gradually shifted its religious loyalties. The story of this religious evolution is one of both continuity and rupture – a testament to the dynamic cultural interchange in the Greco-Roman world.

I’ll draft the beginning of your Judaism chapter with a focus on the tragic development of Jewish monotheism, centered on the cult of Yahweh. This will include the historical evolution of Yahweh from a warrior-storm god within a polytheistic milieu to the sole deity of monotheism, drawing on scholarly sources like Mark S.

# The Tragic Development of Jewish Monotheism

## Polytheistic Beginnings in the Canaanite World

The story of Yahweh begins in a world of many gods. Early Israelite religion did not spring from a vacuum of pure monotheism; it emerged from the rich polytheistic milieu of the ancient Southern Levant. The Canaanite pantheon, well-known from Ugaritic texts, was headed by the high god *El* (a paternal creator figure) and his consort *Asherah*, alongside powerful deities like *Baal* (a young warrior-storm god), *Anat* (a fierce goddess of war), *Astarte* (a love and fertility goddess), and others. Early Israelites '''worshipped Yahweh within this pantheon''', not as a solitary god but as one among many. In fact, archaeological and textual evidence strongly suggests that Israel’s earliest worship included these Canaanite gods as part of its heritage. Biblical writers themselves remember Terah, Abraham’s father, serving “other gods” beyond the Euphrates (Joshua 24:2), and throughout the pre-exilic period the average Israelite farmstead or village would have recognized multiple divine powers at work in the world. Recent scholarship by Mark S. Smith, John Day, and Ziony Zevit confirms that '''ancient Israelite religion was largely Canaanite in origin''', meaning that the shift to exclusive Yahweh worship represented a dramatic break from Israel’s own past rather than from some entirely foreign influence. In short, '''the earliest Israelites were polytheists''', and Yahweh was originally venerated alongside other gods and goddesses, not in isolation.

 &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--image--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; *Inscription from an 8th-century BCE jar found at Kuntillet Ajrud (Sinai) invoking “Yahweh and his Asherah.” Such finds indicate that Israelites in the monarchic period often '''worshipped Yahweh together with a consort deity (Asherah)''', reflecting a blend of old Canaanite traditions within Yahweh’s cult &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Yahwism - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahwism#:~:text=gods%20%20and%20%2081,6&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Yahwism - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahwism#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20broad%20consensus,37&lt;/ref&gt;.*

One striking example of this early '''religious pluralism''' is the role of the goddess Asherah. In Canaanite myth, Asherah was the wife of El, the supreme god. Evidence suggests that Israelites likewise honored Asherah as a divine consort – presumably as the consort of Yahweh once Yahweh was identified with El. The Hebrew Bible preserves echoes of her veneration: poles or trees called *asherim* stood beside many altars, and at least one biblical tradition refers to the goddess as the “Queen of Heaven” worshipped by Judah’s women (Jeremiah 7:18, 44:17-19). Archaeologically, '''inscriptions from Khirbet el-Qom and Kuntillet Ajrud''' explicitly invoke “Yahweh and his Asherah,” implying the two were worshipped as a pair &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Yahwism - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahwism#:~:text=gods%20%20and%20%2081,6&lt;/ref&gt;. Even centuries later, in the 5th century BCE, the Jewish community at Elephantine in Egypt had a temple to *Yahu* (Yahweh) that included the worship of a female deity named *Anat-Yahu*, likely a local form of Yahweh’s old consort &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Yahwism - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahwism#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20broad%20consensus,37&lt;/ref&gt;. All this underscores that '''for much of Israel’s early history, monotheism had not yet taken hold'''. Yahweh was the *chief* god of Israel, but not the *only* god – an important member of a larger family of deities. As John Day succinctly put it, Yahweh’s '''origins were distinct from those of El''' of Ugarit, and only over time did Israelite theology merge the two figures into one. The elevation of Yahweh above other gods was a gradual, tension-filled process, not a starting assumption.

## Yahweh’s Emergence as a Southern Warrior Deity

How did Yahweh enter this pantheon in the first place? Both biblical and extrabiblical evidence point to '''Yahweh’s origins outside the land of Canaan''', in the arid southern regions. The Bible preserves memories of Yahweh coming from *Seir*, *Edom*, or *Mount Paran* (e.g. Judges 5:4, Deuteronomy 33:2), regions to the south of Israel. This aligns with ancient Egyptian inscriptions that mention a group called the “Shasu of '''YHW''',” apparently referring to a tribe or region devoted to Yahweh, in the deserts of Edom/Seir &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shasu - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shasu#:~:text=In%20the%2013th%20century%20BCE,states%20came%20under&lt;/ref&gt;. Notably, a 14th-century BCE topographical list from the temple of Soleb (built by Pharaoh Amenhotep III) includes a place named “tꜣ šꜣsw yhw,” *the land of the Shasu of Yahweh* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Shasu - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shasu#:~:text=In%20the%2013th%20century%20BCE,states%20came%20under&lt;/ref&gt;. This is the earliest known reference to the name *Yahweh*. It suggests that '''Yahweh was originally worshipped by semi-nomadic peoples in the southern Transjordan or Sinai''' – likely as a patron deity of those tribes. In other words, long before Yahweh was known in the hill country of Canaan, he was a '''desert god''' associated with the wilderness and remote regions. Mark S. Smith and others argue that Yahweh began as a '''Midianite or Edomite warrior-storm god''', akin to Baal in function but rooted in the south. He may have been venerated by clans like the Kenites or Shasu whom the Israelites encountered during their early migrations. Indeed, in the Exodus tradition Moses flees to Midian and there joins a Midianite family whose patriarch *Jethro* is a priest of the “God of Sinai” – a narrative hint that the knowledge of Yahweh was conveyed to Israel through Midianite channels (Exodus 18:1-12). This Southern origin theory is also supported by the theophoric names and poetry of early Israel: Yahweh is portrayed marching from Edom with mountain-quaking power (Habakkuk 3:3, Psalm 68:7-8). Thus, rather than being an age-old Canaanite god of the agricultural cycle, Yahweh burst onto the scene of Israelite religion as a '''divine warrior from the desert''', a god of storms and battles who '''“came from Teman”''' (Hab. 3:3) to fight on Israel’s behalf.

Crucially, when Yahweh entered the Israelite highland culture (perhaps in the early Iron Age, ca. 12th–11th centuries BCE), he did not do so as an immediate supreme deity. '''He had to compete and coexist with the established gods''' of the land. Initially, Yahweh may have been seen as a manifestation or newcomer under the authority of El, the venerable creator. Frank Moore Cross, in *Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic*, observed that by the time of the Judges and early monarchy, '''Yahweh was increasingly identified with El''', effectively subsuming El’s role as chief god of Israel. In early Israelite poetry, titles and attributes of El are often applied to Yahweh. For instance, Genesis 49:24 calls Yahweh “the Mighty One of Jacob” (*abir Ya‘aqov*), and similar epithet transfers occur frequently. Cross even speculated that the very name “Yahweh” might derive from a cultic title of El (*ʾēl ḏū yahwī ṣaba’ôt*, meaning “El who creates the hosts”), though direct evidence for this is lacking. Whether or not that etymology holds, it is clear that '''Israel’s understanding of Yahweh grew by absorbing aspects of El'''. As Mark S. Smith describes it, a process of “convergence” took place: over a few centuries, traits of other deities converged on Yahweh. El’s creator beneficence, Baal’s storm-bringing power, even Asherah’s nurturing aspects – all were gradually incorporated into Yahweh’s persona. By the time the Israelite kingdom was established, many Israelites spoke of Yahweh with epithets that once belonged to El (such as *El Shaddai* or *El Elyon*). '''Yahweh had effectively become Israel’s national god''', but in a way that merged identities: Yahweh was now understood as the same god who was formerly called El, the “God of the fathers”. This syncretism is vividly illustrated by the *Bull Iconography*. The bull was a symbol of El’s strength and Baal’s fertility in Canaanite religion, and significantly, the '''earliest Israelite cultic shrine discovered (the 12th-century BCE “Bull Site” in Samaria)''' contained a bronze bull figurine likely representing the deity of that sanctuary. Scholars interpret this as evidence that the worshippers at that site envisioned their god in the form of a bull – suggesting they saw Yahweh (if it was Yahweh they worshipped) as embodying El’s potent virility or Baal’s storm vigor. In any case, by the 10th or 9th century BCE, '''Yahweh had risen to the top of Israel’s pantheon''', effectively displacing El in that position. But beneath him remained a host of lesser gods – Baal, Asherah, Astarte, Chemosh, Dagon, etc. – reverenced by various Israelite communities. The '''path toward monotheism''' would be anything but smooth, as it required eradicating or redefining these other divine figures that had long been part of Israel’s religious life.

## From Henotheism to Exclusive Yahweh Worship

During the monarchic period (c. 1000–586 BCE), pressures both internal and external began pushing Israelite religion toward '''exclusive Yahweh worship'''. This was a slow transformation from '''henotheism or monolatry''' (worship of one god without denying others exist) to true monotheism (belief that only one god exists). Early on, many Israelites might have '''worshipped Yahweh as their patron without denying that other nations had their own gods'''. In fact, an old poem preserved in Deuteronomy 32:8–9 (in one textual tradition) implies that Yahweh was originally seen as one of the “sons of El” assigned to Israel, while other peoples had their own patron deities &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Yahweh - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh#:~:text=match%20at%20L621%20It%20has,62&lt;/ref&gt;. This reflects a worldview in which Yahweh was *supreme for Israel* but not alone in the universe. Such a theology is often called *monolatry*. For centuries, the official religion of Israel and Judah can be described as '''Yahwistic monolatry''': in principle the nation should worship only Yahweh, but it was acknowledged (even by the First Commandment, “no other gods *before Me*”) that other gods existed for other peoples. Enforcement of this ideal within Israel itself waxed and waned. The historical books of the Bible recount constant lapses and “idolatry” – which, from the modern perspective, were simply Israelites continuing to honor Baal, Asherah, the Queen of Heaven, and other divinities alongside Yahweh, as had been customary for generations.

Several factors gradually '''turned the tide against polytheistic worship'''. One was the rise of prophecy as a force for religious purity. Prophets like *Elijah*, *Hosea*, and *Jeremiah* passionately championed sole allegiance to Yahweh and excoriated the Israelites for “whoring” after other gods. The showdown between Elijah and the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18) is a vivid example: Elijah poses the challenge, “If Yahweh is God, follow him; if Baal, then follow him,” reflecting a growing insistence on an either-or choice. According to the biblical account, Elijah’s victory led to the execution of Baal’s prophets and a temporary resurgence of exclusive Yahweh worship. Historically, we might doubt the full eradication of Baalism at that moment, but '''by the 9th century BCE the ideological conflict between Yahweh and Baal had sharpened'''. King Ahab’s sponsorship of Baal’s cult in Samaria (under the influence of Queen Jezebel of Tyre) provoked a backlash that, in the biblical memory, made '''Yahweh versus Baal''' a zero-sum conflict. From that point on, Yahweh’s worshippers treated Baal as a rival not to be tolerated. '''Worship of Baal and Yahweh could no longer peacefully coexist''' as it seemingly had in earlier times. The prophets continually reminded Israel that calamity would follow infidelity to Yahweh – a warning that gained credibility as the kingdom of Israel faced mounting political disasters.

Another factor was '''political centralization under kings who supported Yahweh-alone theology'''. The clearest example is King *Josiah* of Judah (late 7th century BCE). Building on earlier reforms (perhaps initiated by King Hezekiah a century prior), Josiah undertook a radical purge of non-Yahwistic religion: he destroyed rural shrines (the *high places*), defiled the altars of other gods, removed the statue of Asherah from the Temple in Jerusalem, and slaughtered illegitimate priests (see 2 Kings 22–23). Josiah’s reform (c. 622 BCE), which coincided with the “discovery” of a law book often identified with Deuteronomy, '''aimed to establish Yahweh as the *only* god of Judah''' and Jerusalem’s Temple as the only sanctioned place of worship. This reform was both religious and political: by centralizing worship in the capital, Josiah tightened his control over the kingdom and its ideology. Archaeology bears witness to the aftermath; for example, at Tel Arad in the Beersheba Valley, a small fortress-temple dedicated to Yahweh (and probably Asherah) was '''deliberately dismantled in the late 7th century''', likely as part of Josiah’s purge. Two incense altars and standing stones were buried there, one stone possibly representing Yahweh and the other Asherah. Throughout the land, similar local cultic sites were shuttered. Such measures dramatically narrowed the scope of acceptable worship – a '''theological narrowing''' hand in hand with political unification. Yet, it is important to note that '''Josiah’s monotheistic reform was short-lived''' in impact. His death in battle (609 BCE) and the subsequent upheavals meant that old practices crept back, at least among the populace. As Ziony Zevit has observed, neither Israel nor Judah ever achieved total cultic uniformity; even during the monarchy, pockets of folk religion endured and the populace’s faith “was not monolithic in either monotheism or polytheism”. Still, by the end of the 7th century, a dedicated core of Yahweh-only loyalists had formed – a party of theologians, prophets, and reformers who '''defined national devotion in fiercely exclusive terms''' &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Yahwism - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahwism#:~:text=The%20worship%20of%20Yahweh%20alone,The%20early%20supporters%20of%20this&lt;/ref&gt;. These believers (the Deuteronomistic circle, we might call them) set the stage for what would become full-blown monotheism, though the decisive push was yet to come.

## Crisis and Exile: The Crucible of Monotheism

It was the shattering series of events in the 6th century BCE – the '''collapse of the Israelite kingdoms under Assyrian and Babylonian empires''' – that truly gave birth to Jewish monotheism as we know it. The northern kingdom of Israel had already been destroyed by Assyria in 722 BCE, an event that some prophets interpreted as Yahweh’s judgment on a nation that worshipped “Baals” (Hosea 2:8, 13). But an even greater theological crisis followed a century later. In 586 BCE, the Babylonians conquered Judah, burned Jerusalem, razed Solomon’s Temple, and deported a large portion of the Judahite population to exile in Babylon. This national catastrophe was unprecedented. It forced the Judahite elites and priests to ask: '''Had Yahweh been defeated by Babylon’s god Marduk?''' Were the old promises to David and Zion false, or was Yahweh punishing his own people? The very covenant seemed broken. In response to this existential despair, a remarkable transformation took place among the exiled Judeans. Rather than abandon Yahweh for the apparent victor (Marduk), the Judean theologians went in the opposite direction – they '''doubled down on Yahweh’s supremacy, to the point of denying the reality of any other god'''. In the words of one scholar, the “collective and trans-generational trauma of the Babylonian Exile” catalyzed a theological revolution, serving as the *birth trauma of monotheism* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--102105_Biblica_2020-1_01_OT_Markl.indd--&gt;https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/82788/Markl_Babylonian_2020.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=trans%02generational%20trauma%20of%20the%20Babylonian,research%2C%20by%20sketching%20the%20contours&lt;/ref&gt;. During the exile, prophets and priests reinterpreted Israel’s entire history, concluding that '''Yahweh alone had been in charge all along''' – not just of Israel, but of Assyria and Babylon too. Second Isaiah (Isaiah 40–55), writing in Babylon, declares boldly that Yahweh is *the only God*: “*I am Yahweh, and there is none else*” (Isa. 45:5). He even makes Yahweh say, “*I form light and create darkness, I make peace and create evil*” (Isa. 45:7), a stunning assertion that all forces, good or bad, come from one deity. This was a direct answer to the problem of the exile: if disaster struck, it must have been Yahweh’s doing, since no other gods exist to oppose him. Thus the '''destruction of Judah was interpreted as Yahweh’s own work''' – a drastic, even tragic, reimagining of Israel’s god as the lord of all history, using the pagan armies as unwitting instruments of his will.

By the end of the Babylonian captivity (538 BCE), this '''monotheistic idea''' had crystallized among the Judeans. As one historical summary puts it, during the exile “the followers of Yahweh went a step further and denied that any deities aside from Yahweh existed at all – marking the transition from monolatry to monotheism”. In effect, '''Yahweh had no more competition''': the other gods were either declared fictional or demoted to insignificant demons. When the Persians (who were monotheists of a sort themselves, worshipping Ahura Mazda) allowed the Judeans to return and rebuild the Temple, the Judah that emerged in the 5th century BCE was ideologically committed to *Yahweh-alone*. This does not mean that folk beliefs in angels, spirits, or even divine consorts vanished overnight, but the mainstream religious leadership now preached an uncompromising monotheism. The many gods of old were reinterpreted as mere names or attributes of the one Yahweh, or as idols with “no breath in them.” In the fervent rhetoric of this period (found in Second Isaiah, Jeremiah, Deuteronomy, etc.), we can sense both '''triumph and loss''' – triumph that Yahweh is vindicated as the true god of all nations, but loss in the abandonment of a rich divine council that had once populated Israel’s spiritual imagination. Monotheism, in this light, '''arose from the ashes of defeat'''. It was a theological consolation prize for a people who had lost everything else. Rather than concede that Marduk or Baal had overpowered Yahweh, the faithful reinterpreted Yahweh as having *used Babylon* to chastise his people. This interpretation kept Yahweh’s omnipotence intact at the cost of making him the author of their trauma. Herein lies the “tragic development” of our title: Israel’s devotion to Yahweh became more absolute '''because of national tragedy''' – because only an all-powerful god could still be worth worshipping after allowing His own house to burn.

## A Narrowing Path – Monotheism as Historical Response

The rise of Jewish monotheism was not a calm, philosophical evolution toward a higher truth; it was a '''hard-fought, painful contraction of theological possibilities''' under the pressure of historical catastrophe. Scholars like Mark S. Smith have emphasized that Israel’s shift to one-god-only faith was contingent and context-dependent – a response to the collapse of older certainties, not an inevitable progression of religious thought. What began as '''monolatry born from covenant loyalty''' (“Yahweh is our god, we should have no others before him”) turned into a far more extreme claim in the exile: '''Yahweh is the *only* god, and he is behind both our rise and our fall'''. This '''narrowing of theological vision''' – from many gods, to one god for us, to one God for all – came at a spiritual cost. The rich pantheon of the Iron Age, with its balancing of divine male and female, storm and fertility, war and wisdom, was largely wiped away. The people of Israel/Judah, scarred by war and displacement, found meaning in an uncompromising creed that explained their suffering as part of a divine plan. Monotheism was, in a sense, '''the last god left standing''' after the others had failed to protect. 

From an academic perspective, we can trace how this consolidation was driven by '''violence and trauma''' at every stage. The convergence of Yahweh with El and Baal was likely accelerated by the '''violence of state formation''' – as the Israelite kingdoms established themselves, they elevated their national patron (Yahweh) through royal propaganda and, when possible, suppressed rival cults. The elimination of Baal worship, for example, was often a bloody affair (Jehu’s massacre of Baal’s priests in 2 Kings 10, or the aforementioned Carmel contest). The monotheistic reforms involved '''iconoclasm and persecution''' of those attached to traditional folk religion (Josiah’s reform is recounted as violently as it is zealously). Finally, the '''violence of foreign conquest and exile''' forced a spiritual crisis that snuffed out any remaining ambiguity: only an omnipotent Yahweh could ultimately make sense of the disaster. It is therefore accurate to say that '''monotheism did not emerge out of serene theological reasoning''', but out of '''historical brokenness'''. The academic John Day notes that even after these developments, vestiges of polytheism lingered in the culture (for instance, personal names in the 6th century still sometimes contained Baal or El, showing a broader cultural memory). But the official theological trajectory had turned decisively toward '''“Yahweh alone”'''. Frank Moore Cross observed that what made Israelite religion unique was not the idea of one god per se (many Ancient Near Eastern religions had a supreme deity), but the '''denial of all others''' – and this idea took shape powerfully in the exilic and post-exilic community as a kind of “silent revolution.” &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--102105_Biblica_2020-1_01_OT_Markl.indd--&gt;https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/82788/Markl_Babylonian_2020.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=trans%02generational%20trauma%20of%20the%20Babylonian,research%2C%20by%20sketching%20the%20contours&lt;/ref&gt; In the Second Temple period that followed, Jewish religion was rebuilt around the sole worship of Yahweh, now understood as the universal Creator, the source of both Israel’s hope and Israel’s suffering. 

Looking at this development with a tragic lens means recognizing the '''loss and suffering inherent in the birth of monotheism'''. It was “tragic” not in the sense of being unfortunate (from a believer’s viewpoint monotheism is a profound truth), but in the classical sense of arising through '''tragic circumstances''' – through downfall, struggle, and profound cost. Theological diversity was sacrificed for the sake of identity and survival. The '''cult of Yahweh''' had to slay its own family, as it were, to emerge pure. What had begun centuries earlier as a simple reverence of one god among many ended in an absolute claim that would forever distinguish Judaism (and its offshoots Christianity and Islam) from the religions of the ancient world. As one era’s gods faded into memory, '''Yahweh stood alone''', transfigured by Israel’s pain into the One God of all. This opening chapter, then, traces how that remarkable transformation occurred – '''not by predestined philosophical enlightenment, but through a crucible of history''': war, collapse, exile, and the relentless '''prophetic drive to find meaning in disaster'''. In the developments ahead, we shall see how each stage of Yahweh’s evolution – from warrior of Sinai to King of Heaven – carried with it both gain and loss, and why understanding this '''tragic development of Jewish monotheism''' is crucial for comprehending the spiritual trajectory of the Western world &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--102105_Biblica_2020-1_01_OT_Markl.indd--&gt;https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/82788/Markl_Babylonian_2020.pdf?sequence=1#:~:text=trans%02generational%20trauma%20of%20the%20Babylonian,research%2C%20by%20sketching%20the%20contours&lt;/ref&gt;.

The previous section traced the origins of god-worshipping across six major historical formations: Egypt, Israel, Persia, Rome, China, and Japan. Each of these traditions began with acts of recognition, ritual development, and mythic codification—what I earlier described as the coding of god-worship. But across all of them, a process of despotic overcoding occurred. These rich traditions were subsumed into imperial power: temples became fiscal centers, prophets were co-opted, and the gods became tools of centralized rule. 

This section now begins the story of the last 500 years: a story of *decoding*. It is the story of religion in the modern sense. Of Protestantism. Of colonization. Of privatization. Of disenchantment. And ultimately, of neoliberal spectacle.

I will now begin to use the term *religion* much more freely. In the previous section, I avoided it as a colonial concept—anachronistically imposed onto systems that never saw themselves as belonging to a category called "religion." But in the modern age, religion becomes a thing in itself. It becomes visible, portable, and exportable. It becomes a commodity, a weapon, a passport stamp.

And yet, god-worshipping persists. But it is not left unchanged.

What I want to argue here is that the privatization of god-worship—the liberalization of religion—has ultimately served *capital* more than it has served any specific god. The shift from public ritual to private belief did not happen by accident. It was designed. And it is precisely this shift that allowed capital to flourish: by ensuring that meaning would never again interfere with markets.

Evangelicalism is the ultimate yassification of religion. It presents itself as a return to purity, a revival of tradition—but it is nothing of the sort. It is emotionally intense but structurally hollow. Ritually shallow but rhetorically powerful. It claims to be anti-modern, but in practice it is the most compatible form of worship with market capitalism. 

Evangelicalism is:
- A privatized system of belief with no lineage, no ancestry, no land.
- A structure of emotional manipulation easily livestreamed, branded, and monetized.
- A hyperdecoded performance of submission to authority, masquerading as personal empowerment.

Earlier stages of capital could afford to simply *decode* god-worship—to render it meaningless, to leave behind a population of secular workers. But now, as birthrates collapse and labor dwindles, capital must turn back to religion. It needs obedience. It needs growth. It needs a new despotism, disguised in pop aesthetics. And so Evangelicalism becomes the ideal vehicle. Fertility cult masked as Jesus. Church-as-franchise. Worship as algorithmic spectacle.

Japan attempted to resist this through the public elevation of Shinto. The Department of Divinities (神祇官, ''jingi-kan'') system preserved a degree of public ritual infrastructure well into modernity. But State Shinto was not a victory of the gods—it was their bureaucratic taxidermy. Shinto survived institutionally, but its lifeblood was drained for the sake of imperial overcoding.

In this section, we will explore the slow motion collapse of public god-worship and the rise of religion as a privatized aesthetic product. But we will also see its limits. The gods, even when trapped in memes, yearn to break free. And this is where we may find hope for their return.
== Section Lambda: Codes, Despots, and the Modern Collapse ==

In this section, we move from the cosmogonic depths of god-worship's origins (Section Alpha) into the entangled social world that shapes and reshapes god-worship under historical pressure. This is Section Lambda, named for the symbolic middle—the link between origin and culmination. Here we trace how ritual codes become social structures, how those structures are overcoded by despotic regimes, and how capitalist modernity ultimately seeks to decode everything into abstract units of value.

Let us begin with a basic premise: every god-worshipping tradition exists not only as a spiritual practice, but as a social form. Its rituals, symbols, myths, and cults are embedded in the material life of a society. These are not just beliefs—they are codes. And those codes emerge from the practices of people embedded in specific lifeworlds. They are generated from experience, from repetition, from relevance realization. But these codes are not stable. They are vulnerable to capture.

What Deleuze and Guattari call **despotic overcoding** is what happens when a dominant power subsumes the codes of a people under its own semiotic regime. The blacksmiths of the Dogon did not simply preserve a sacred tradition—they created sacredness out of technical knowledge. But when overcoding appears, the power of kings, priests, or bureaucracies rewrites meaning from the top down. The forge becomes subordinate to a cosmology imposed by decree.

This is how religion became what it is in the modern West: a privatized, hollowed category. In the six case studies from Section Alpha, we will see despotic overcoding at work: in the pharaoh’s suppression of Atenism, in the priestly restructuring of Israelite cult, in Zoroaster’s collusion with imperial Persia, in the Roman imperial cult, in Chinese imperial ritual formalism, and in Meiji Japan’s codification of kami.

But Section Lambda is not about those original despotisms. It is about the **transition into modernity**, when the despotic overcoding of local god-worship is no longer enough. Capitalism does not want to overwrite local codes. It wants to **decode** them—to strip them of symbolic meaning entirely. Where despotism rewrites, capitalism erases.

In the past, a cow might be sacred, or tied to a dowry, or linked to ancestral prestige. In capitalism, a cow is a unit of exchange, reducible to its dollar value. Ritual, kinship, sacrifice—these are inefficient. What matters is the number. The exchange.

This decoding process is not passive. It requires and reproduces systems of domination. As symbolic codes break down, the social functions they once performed are maintained by brute force. In the American context, the privatization of religion, the erosion of kinship ties, and the rise of evangelicalism are not contradictions but symptoms. Evangelicalism is **yassified religion**—stripped of historical depth, engineered for compliance, staged for emotional impact. It cooperates with capital because it was made in its image.

Japan tried to resist this. Through the Jingikan and the State Shinto system, it attempted to **recode** its native god-worship within the framework of a modern nation. But it failed. State Shinto was not a triumph of kami—it was a triumph of Meiji bureaucracy. Shinto survived, but the form it took was bureaucratically flattened. Its gods were conscripted into nationalist myth. Even resistance became instrumental.

We are now at the crisis point. Capitalism, having decoded religion and kinship, now turns its attention to **desire itself**. Dating apps, marketing algorithms, and neuro-optimization tools all convert yearning into quantifiable flows. We no longer worship gods. We match, optimize, consume. We are told this is freedom. But it is a cage with no bars.

The collapse of social codes has not led to liberation, but to **raw domination**—a society governed not by gods or even by laws, but by efficiency calculations backed by coercive force. The spiritual exhaustion of the West is not accidental. It is the end result of centuries of overcoding followed by total decoding.

Yet from this collapse, something new may emerge. In the gaps left by broken codes, **god-worship** can return—not as nostalgia, but as insurgency. A practice of love, of relation, of sacred recomposition. The codes are not dead. They have only been covered in white paint, thin enough to still see the lines beneath.

Let this section be the bridge. From the gods of old, to the ruins of modernity, and toward the sacred again.

We begin.

== Comparative Development of Religion and Writing in China, Japan, the Roman Empire, India, and Southeast Asia ==
'''Introduction:''' Across world civilizations, religions and writing systems evolved in distinct ways due to a complex interplay of political power, cultural values, philosophy, and language. This comparative analysis examines why East Asian societies like China and Japan retained polytheistic traditions, while the Roman Empire embraced Christianity (monotheism), and why India and Southeast Asia saw enduring polytheism despite encounters with Islam and Christianity. It also explores why China kept its logographic writing system instead of adopting alphabetic scripts as in the Roman world. By analyzing historical cases and scholarly insights, we can understand how governance, worldview, and linguistic needs shaped these divergent paths in religion and writing.

=== Polytheism in China and Japan vs. Monotheism in the Roman Empire ===
Both China and Japan historically nurtured '''polytheistic and pluralistic religious landscapes''', in contrast to the Roman Empire’s late adoption of '''exclusive monotheism'''. In East Asia, religious practice was characterized by *syncretism* – individuals and communities freely blended '''multiple faiths''' (ancestral worship, '''Taoism''', '''Buddhism''', '''Shinto''', etc.) without a sense of contradiction &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Natural Polytheism in China - The American Interest--&gt;https://www.the-american-interest.com/2011/11/30/natural-polytheism-in-china/#:~:text=Buddhism%20was%20introduced%20into%20China,its%20role%20as%20a%20state&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Japanese Religions | FSI--&gt;http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions#:~:text=in%20this%20period%20as%20well%2C,culture%20that%20some%20missionaries%20exhibited&lt;/ref&gt;.

This meant that '''no single faith claimed absolute allegiance''' in China or Japan; instead, a *“natural polytheism”* persisted, as one observer quipped, because East Asian cultures were traditionally “averse to downsizing” the number of gods in the universe &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Natural Polytheism in China - The American Interest--&gt;https://www.the-american-interest.com/2011/11/30/natural-polytheism-in-china/#:~:text=years%20ago%2C%20a%20Japanese%20philosopher,natural%20polytheism&lt;/ref&gt;. In Japan, the indigenous '''Shinto''' belief in countless *kami* (spirits) coexisted alongside Buddhism. When '''Christianity''' arrived, it remained a minor movement and faced political suppression in the 17th century. One major barrier was '''Christianity’s demand for exclusive allegiance''', which starkly contrasted with the '''inclusive approach''' of Japanese religion &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Japanese Religions | FSI--&gt;http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions#:~:text=in%20this%20period%20as%20well%2C,culture%20that%20some%20missionaries%20exhibited&lt;/ref&gt;. Japanese converts were expected by missionaries to abandon all other gods, an attitude viewed as arrogant by Japanese society &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Japanese Religions | FSI--&gt;http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions#:~:text=in%20this%20period%20as%20well%2C,culture%20that%20some%20missionaries%20exhibited&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, culturally and philosophically, East Asia favored *pluralism* over the either/or exclusivity of monotheism.

By contrast, the '''Roman Empire''' underwent a dramatic religious transformation in the 4th century CE, moving from a polytheistic Greco-Roman pantheon to '''state-backed Christianity'''. Several factors explain this shift toward monotheism. Politically, the empire’s leadership came to see '''monotheism as a unifying tool''' – encapsulated in Emperor Aurelian’s ideal of “*one god, one empire*,” later embraced by Constantine &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Constantine’s Conversion to Christianity - World History Encyclopedia--&gt;https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1737/constantines-conversion-to-christianity/#:~:text=During%20the%20reign%20of%20Emperor,the%20cult%20of%20Sol%20Invictus&lt;/ref&gt;. The '''cult of Sol Invictus''' (the Unconquered Sun) rose to prominence in the late 3rd century as a sort of henotheistic cult merging several deities into one, preparing the ideological ground for a single supreme deity &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Constantine’s Conversion to Christianity - World History Encyclopedia--&gt;https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1737/constantines-conversion-to-christianity/#:~:text=During%20the%20reign%20of%20Emperor,the%20cult%20of%20Sol%20Invictus&lt;/ref&gt;. When Emperor '''Constantine''' converted to Christianity (312 CE) and issued the Edict of Milan (313 CE) granting it legal status, he set the empire on a new course. Over the next decades, Christian population and influence grew within the imperial establishment. Finally, under Emperor '''Theodosius I''', Christianity was proclaimed the official state religion and traditional pagan cults were outlawed (Edict of 381 CE) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Constantine’s Conversion to Christianity - World History Encyclopedia--&gt;https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1737/constantines-conversion-to-christianity/#:~:text=cults%20would%20not%20be%20outlawed,Theodosius%20I%20in%20381%20CE&lt;/ref&gt;. This top-down enforcement effectively '''“crowded out” polytheism''' within the empire. Culturally, the '''exclusivist theology''' of Christianity (and similarly of later Islam) conflicted with the previous Roman religious pluralism that had tolerated many gods &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Natural Polytheism in China - The American Interest--&gt;https://www.the-american-interest.com/2011/11/30/natural-polytheism-in-china/#:~:text=controlling%20religion%2C%20knowing%20well%20the,forth%20between%20repression%20and%20toleration&lt;/ref&gt;. But the new monotheistic paradigm gained appeal as it offered a universal truth and moral framework at a time of imperial crisis. '''Philosophical currents''' in the Greco-Roman world (like Neoplatonism’s notion of a single ultimate principle) may have also made the idea of '''one supreme God''' intellectually attractive. In short, the Roman Empire’s embrace of Christianity was driven by a confluence of imperial policy and the monotheistic religion’s rising social momentum, marking a decisive break from the polytheism that continued to thrive in East Asia.

=== China’s Logographic Writing vs. Alphabetic Scripts in the West ===
Another striking East–West divergence is found in '''writing systems''': China famously retained its '''logographic''' script (characters representing words or morphemes), whereas the Roman world and India used '''alphabetic or syllabic''' scripts (symbols representing sounds). Chinese characters—'''hanzi'''—have been used continuously for over three millennia, forming one of the world’s oldest writing traditions &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Chinese writing | History, Characters &amp; Strokes | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-writing#:~:text=It%20is%20not%20known%20when,found%20in%20inscriptions&lt;/ref&gt;. Unlike an alphabet, which uses a small set of letters to spell out phonetic syllables, the Chinese system uses thousands of distinct characters. Each character typically corresponds to a unit of meaning, not a phonetic spelling &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Chinese writing | History, Characters &amp; Strokes | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-writing#:~:text=Because%20basic%20characters%20or%20graphs,to%20a%20unit%20of%20thought&lt;/ref&gt;. 

'''Why did China persist with this logographic system instead of adopting an alphabet?''' Several practical and linguistic reasons stand out. First, the '''Chinese language’s structure''' made a purely phonetic alphabet problematic. Chinese is rich in '''homophones'''—many words have identical or very similar sounds. Ancient scribes found that if they tried to use simple phonetic signs, a written word could become '''ambiguous''', readable in more than one way &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Chinese writing | History, Characters &amp; Strokes | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-writing#:~:text=Although%20it%20was%20possible%20to,character%20would%20be%20extremely%20ambiguous&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, dozens of common words might share the pronunciation *shi* in different tones, so writing “shi” alphabetically would be confusing. The '''logographic principle''' elegantly solved this by assigning unique symbols to different words/meanings, avoiding phonetic ambiguity &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Chinese writing | History, Characters &amp; Strokes | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-writing#:~:text=Although%20it%20was%20possible%20to,character%20would%20be%20extremely%20ambiguous&lt;/ref&gt;. Over time, Chinese characters evolved to include phonetic *and* semantic components within each character, which helped indicate pronunciation while still distinguishing meaning &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Chinese writing | History, Characters &amp; Strokes | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-writing#:~:text=approached%20the%20form%20of%20writing,character%20would%20be%20extremely%20ambiguous&lt;/ref&gt;. In short, '''linguistic necessity''' favored characters: a switch to a simple alphabet early on could have made writing Chinese extremely confusing &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Chinese writing | History, Characters &amp; Strokes | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-writing#:~:text=Although%20it%20was%20possible%20to,character%20would%20be%20extremely%20ambiguous&lt;/ref&gt;.

Second, the Chinese writing system became deeply embedded in '''culture and governance'''. From the Qin dynasty (3rd century BCE) onward, emperors standardized the characters across the realm, using script unity to '''bind a diverse empire'''. Characters allowed people speaking different Chinese dialects (or even different languages in East Asia) to read the same text, because the script conveys meaning directly. This gave logographic writing a unifying power—'''written Chinese transcended pronunciation differences'''. In contrast, an alphabetical script tied to pronunciation would have favored one dialect (likely the imperial court’s speech) and marginalized others. Culturally, the Chinese script was revered as an art (calligraphy) and was the medium of the classics, philosophy, and law. Mastery of the '''classic character corpus''' was the key to entering the elite civil service. Such a prestigious literary heritage created *inertia* against adopting a foreign alphabet. Indeed, as late as the 18th century, more than half of the world’s printed books were written in Chinese characters &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Chinese writing | History, Characters &amp; Strokes | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-writing#:~:text=Like%20Semitic%20writing%20in%20the,writings%20on%20government%20and%20law&lt;/ref&gt;, underscoring how successful and widespread this writing system was. Even when confronted with Western alphabets in modern times, China chose to '''maintain its script''' – for example, introducing the '''Pinyin''' romanization in 1958 only as a supplementary phonetic aid, *not* a replacement for characters &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Chinese writing | History, Characters &amp; Strokes | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-writing#:~:text=Roman%20alphabet%20was%20adopted%20in,of%20strokes%20used%20in%20writing&lt;/ref&gt;. The continued use of logographs was tied to national identity and the practical benefit of cross-dialect readability.

By contrast, the '''Roman world and India''' used alphabets or '''abugidas''' (sound-based scripts) that were well-suited to their languages. Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit have relatively manageable sets of sounds, so a small alphabet could unambiguously represent words. The '''Roman (Latin) alphabet''' has just two dozen letters, which worked efficiently for writing Indo-European languages. It was easily learned and adapted to other tongues, aiding administration and trade across the Roman Empire. Alphabetic writing also facilitated technological advances: in medieval Europe, '''Gutenberg’s printing press''' exploited the fact that only a small number of type pieces (letters) were needed for any text. Historians note that the “small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor” in the rapid spread of printing after 1450 CE &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Movable type - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type#:~:text=Around%201450%2C%20German%20goldsmith%20Johannes,9&lt;/ref&gt;. The efficiency of moveable-type printing with alphabets (as opposed to thousands of characters) dramatically lowered the cost of books and boosted literacy in the West &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Movable type - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type#:~:text=For%20alphabetic%20scripts%20%2C%20movable,its%20effectiveness%2C%20its%20%20147&lt;/ref&gt;. In China, by contrast, although woodblock printing and even movable type were invented earlier, the sheer number of characters made '''mass printing''' more labor-intensive and costly, which somewhat limited the spread of printed literature. Despite these pressures, Chinese civilization saw its script as inseparable from its identity – a legacy also visible in '''Japan''', which adopted Chinese characters (kanji) for writing and even today uses a mix of logographic kanji and syllabic kana. In summary, China retained its logographic writing due to the '''linguistic advantages for Chinese speech, the cultural-political value of script unity, and historical momentum''', whereas the Roman world’s alphabetic systems thrived on their simplicity and adaptability to many languages.

=== Endurance of Polytheism in India and Southeast Asia Despite Monotheistic Encounters ===
India and Southeast Asia present another case of '''religious continuity''': despite the arrival of monotheistic faiths like '''Islam''' and '''Christianity''', the region’s older polytheistic or dharmic traditions (Hinduism, Buddhism, etc.) largely persisted as the dominant faiths. In '''India''', the vast majority of the population remained Hindu (a polytheistic tradition) through centuries of Islamic rule (12th–18th centuries) and later European (Christian) colonialism. '''Southeast Asia''' had a mixed experience – Islam became dominant in maritime areas like Malaysia and Indonesia, and Catholicism took root in the Philippines, yet '''Mainland Southeast Asia''' (Burma/Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos) stayed predominantly Buddhist, and even within Muslim-majority Indonesia the island of '''Bali''' preserved its Hindu religion. This enduring polytheism can be attributed to a combination of social resilience, inclusivity, and political circumstances.

One major factor in India’s case was the '''decentralized, elastic nature of Hindu religion'''. Hindu worship was not dependent on a single institution or hierarchy that could be targeted for conversion. Even when Muslim conquerors '''destroyed temples''' and imposed restrictions, the faith survived at the grassroots: rituals simply shifted to other venues, and millions of household priests and ascetics continued their practices independently &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hinduism - Islam, 11th-19th Century | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism/Hinduism-under-Islam-11th-19th-century#:~:text=before%20the%2017th%20century%20has,did%20the%20thousands%20of%20ascetics&lt;/ref&gt;. As a Brittanica analysis notes, Hinduism “endured” the shock of Muslim conquests *“in part because of the absence of a centralized authority”* – village ceremonies, domestic rituals, and wandering holy men kept the religion alive everywhere, outside the control of any one temple or leader &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hinduism - Islam, 11th-19th Century | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism/Hinduism-under-Islam-11th-19th-century#:~:text=was%20less%20firm%2C%20such%20as,did%20the%20thousands%20of%20ascetics&lt;/ref&gt;. In contrast to the centralized Church in medieval Europe, Hinduism’s diffuse structure made it '''hard to eradicate'''. Moreover, '''Hindu philosophy is inherently pluralistic'''. The tradition acknowledges many deities as manifestations of one divine reality, and accepts that there are multiple paths to truth &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Religious pluralism - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_pluralism#:~:text=concluded%20that%20Asian%20religious%20traditions,The%20Age%20of%20Enlightenment&lt;/ref&gt;. This inclusivist mindset meant Hindus did not feel compelled to *reject* new gods or prophets outright – often they could reinterpret Jesus or Allah as just another aspect of the divine rather than the *only* true god. Such an attitude blunted the appeal of exclusive conversion. Indeed, Indian religious leaders from medieval bhakti saints to modern figures like Ram Mohan Roy and Gandhi emphasized the underlying unity of religions, reinforcing tolerance. Socially, Hindu identity also became tied to caste and community structures – converting to Islam or Christianity might mean breaking away from one’s community and patron deities, a step many were reluctant to take. While there were regions of mass conversion (for example, parts of Bengal and the northwest became mostly Muslim, often where '''Buddhism''' had formerly been strong &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hinduism - Islam, 11th-19th Century | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism/Hinduism-under-Islam-11th-19th-century#:~:text=rulers%2C%20however,strongest%E2%80%94Pakistan%2C%20%20248%2C%20and%20Kashmir&lt;/ref&gt;), the core of the subcontinent remained Hindu. Notably, some Muslim rulers like Emperor '''Akbar''' (16th c.) adopted policies of accommodation, promoting dialogue (his *Din-i Ilahi* was a syncretic initiative) rather than forceful proselytizing &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Hinduism - Islam, 11th-19th Century | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism/Hinduism-under-Islam-11th-19th-century#:~:text=attitude%20of%20the%20Muslim%20rulers,strongest%E2%80%94Pakistan%2C%20%20248%2C%20and%20Kashmir&lt;/ref&gt;. Later, European colonial powers in India largely refrained from wholesale missionary coercion; by the time of independence (1947), Hinduism was still the majority faith (with Islam the largest minority), showcasing a millennium-long continuity of polytheistic tradition.

In '''Southeast Asia''', the persistence of non-monotheistic religions was likewise aided by cultural and political factors. Before Islam and Christianity arrived, Southeast Asian kingdoms had been influenced for over a thousand years by '''Hinduism and Buddhism''' (spread from India). Indigenous beliefs in nature spirits and ancestors were often blended with these Indian religions, creating '''syncretic faiths'''. When Islam spread through the islands via traders and Sufi missionaries (13th–16th centuries) and Christianity arrived with Europeans (16th–19th centuries), they encountered populations with deeply ingrained religious syncretism. '''Mainland Southeast Asia''' remained staunchly Buddhist (Theravāda Buddhism) in countries like Siam (Thailand), Burma, and Cambodia. These kingdoms had powerful monarchies that often positioned themselves as protectors of Buddhism – for example, the Thai kings were seen as *Dharmaraja* (righteous kings) upholding the Buddhist order. They successfully resisted both Islamic expansion (e.g. Siam repelled attempts from Muslim Malacca) and later Christian colonial domination, thus preserving their religious heritage. Meanwhile, '''Maritime Southeast Asia''' did embrace Islam more broadly (what is today Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei), but even there the new religion did not wholly displace old beliefs. Scholars note that across Southeast Asia, '''all major religions became “heavily influenced by indigenous animist religion,” resulting in *religious hybrids'''* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Postcolonial Religious Conflict in Southeast Asia - Association for Asian Studies--&gt;https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/postcolonial-religious-conflict-in-southeast-asia/#:~:text=Southeast%20Asia%20is%20geographically%20and,heavily%20influenced%20by%20indigenous%20animist&lt;/ref&gt;. Javanese Islam, for instance, incorporated Hindu-Buddhist concepts and local spirit veneration; many rural Javanese remained '''abangan''', blending Islamic confession with older animistic practices. In Bali, the population (over 90% Hindu) maintained their '''ancient form of Hinduism''' even as the rest of Indonesia converted to Islam &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Balinese and Hindus in Indonesia - Minority Rights Group--&gt;https://minorityrights.org/communities/balinese-and-hindus/#:~:text=Some%201,Sumatra%2C%20Java%2C%20Lombok%20and%20Kalimantan&lt;/ref&gt;. Geographical and political isolation played a role here – Bali became a refuge for Hindu aristocracy fleeing Muslim conquests in Java, and thereafter its community upheld Hindu traditions in relative isolation. Similarly, hill tribes and certain inland communities throughout Southeast Asia often kept their tribal polytheistic or Buddhist practices, sometimes shielded by difficult terrain from lowland religious changes.

Even where colonial powers established rule (such as the Spanish in the Philippines or the British in Burma), the introduced Christianity or other faiths did not entirely erase pre-existing beliefs. The '''Philippines''' did become largely Christian, but even Filipino Catholicism has syncretic elements of folk spirituality. Elsewhere, '''Buddhist-majority nations''' like Myanmar and Thailand entered the modern era with their traditional religion closely tied to national identity. A recent Pew Research study finds that in countries such as Thailand and Cambodia, '''Buddhists see their religion as strongly linked to their nation''' (much as Muslims do in Malaysia or Indonesia) &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Buddhism, Islam and Religious Pluralism in South and Southeast Asia | Pew Research Center--&gt;https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2023/09/12/buddhism-islam-and-religious-pluralism-in-south-and-southeast-asia/#:~:text=In%20Thailand%2C%20Cambodia%20and%20Sri,Muslims%20in%20Malaysia%20and%20Indonesia&lt;/ref&gt;. This highlights how religion became part of '''cultural nationalism''' – a dynamic that helped polytheistic or non-monotheistic religions *persist* by aligning with ethnic or national pride. In summary, India and Southeast Asia demonstrate that '''polytheism and religious pluralism proved resilient''' when facing monotheistic competitors. The reasons include a *flexible, inclusive religious ethos*, the lack of centralized institutions vulnerable to decapitation, and conscious support from political powers or communities to uphold indigenous faiths. New monotheistic religions certainly gained footholds (and in some cases, like Indonesia, became dominant), but across much of this region the older traditions were not supplanted, instead adapting and coexisting alongside Islam or Christianity &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Postcolonial Religious Conflict in Southeast Asia - Association for Asian Studies--&gt;https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/postcolonial-religious-conflict-in-southeast-asia/#:~:text=Southeast%20Asia%20is%20geographically%20and,heavily%20influenced%20by%20indigenous%20animist&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Influencing Factors: Political, Cultural, Philosophical, and Linguistic ===
The contrasting outcomes in religion and writing across these civilizations were not random – they stem from '''distinct political, cultural, philosophical, and linguistic factors''' at play in each society. Below is a breakdown of how each set of factors influenced the development of polytheism vs. monotheism, and logographic vs. alphabetic writing, in our cases:

- '''Political Factors:''' The stance of rulers and states toward religion was crucial. In the Roman Empire, imperial '''policy''' actively promoted Christianity (e.g. Constantine’s endorsement, Theodosius’s ban on pagan cults) to forge unity &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Constantine’s Conversion to Christianity - World History Encyclopedia--&gt;https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1737/constantines-conversion-to-christianity/#:~:text=During%20the%20reign%20of%20Emperor,the%20cult%20of%20Sol%20Invictus&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Constantine’s Conversion to Christianity - World History Encyclopedia--&gt;https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1737/constantines-conversion-to-christianity/#:~:text=cults%20would%20not%20be%20outlawed,Theodosius%20I%20in%20381%20CE&lt;/ref&gt;. Meanwhile, Chinese emperors maintained a state ideology (Confucianism) that oversaw religion without enforcing one “true” faith, thus '''tolerating pluralism''' but preventing any disruptive new cult &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Natural Polytheism in China - The American Interest--&gt;https://www.the-american-interest.com/2011/11/30/natural-polytheism-in-china/#:~:text=ideology%20was%20both%20tolerant%20and,though%20in%20recent%20years%20Uighur&lt;/ref&gt;. In Japan, the Tokugawa shogunate’s political decision to '''suppress Christianity''' ensured the country stayed polytheistic (with Shinto-Buddhist traditions). Similarly, in India and Southeast Asia, many rulers either tolerated multiple faiths or actively championed the indigenous religion (e.g. Hindu Rajputs, Buddhist kings of Siam), providing a political shield for polytheism. Political continuity also affected writing: the Chinese imperial bureaucracy was invested in the character script for administering exams and records, so there was '''no incentive from the state to adopt an alphabet''' that might disrupt governance. In contrast, alphabets in the Roman world spread under the patronage of empires (Roman, and later Islamic empires with the Arabic script), often being imposed in administration and record-keeping. In short, where political authorities enforced a standard (be it a '''state religion or a state script'''), it greatly swayed the historical outcome.

- '''Cultural Factors:''' Deep-seated cultural attitudes and identities shaped these developments. '''Religious exclusivity vs. inclusivity''' is one key cultural divide. Cultures in East Asia, South Asia, and much of Southeast Asia were traditionally '''inclusive''', seeing value in multiple deities and teachings. For example, Japanese culture could accept Shinto and Buddhist practices simultaneously, and even today most Japanese do not identify as strictly one or the other &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Japanese Religions | FSI--&gt;http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions#:~:text=in%20this%20period%20as%20well%2C,culture%20that%20some%20missionaries%20exhibited&lt;/ref&gt;. Such inclusive cultures resisted the all-or-nothing conversion demanded by monotheistic religions &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Japanese Religions | FSI--&gt;http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/japanese_religions#:~:text=in%20this%20period%20as%20well%2C,culture%20that%20some%20missionaries%20exhibited&lt;/ref&gt;. By contrast, the Abrahamic religions carried a culture of '''exclusivism''' (“no other gods before me”), which became culturally dominant in the West and parts of the Middle East. When the Roman Empire shifted to Christianity, this exclusivist culture eventually displaced the earlier pluralistic ethos. Another cultural factor is the value placed on '''tradition'''. Chinese and Japanese societies highly valued continuity with the past—this made them less receptive to foreign religions and scripts. The Chinese reverence for classical texts in their original characters made the culture averse to alphabetizing or radically changing the script. In India, the persistence of Sanskrit and vernacular traditions (written in Brahmi-derived alphabets) meant there was no cultural void that Islam or Western scripts could easily fill; local culture had its own rich literary and religious corpus. In Southeast Asia, cultural pride in '''Indianized civilization''' (temples of Angkor, Borobudur, etc.) meant Hindu-Buddhist legacies retained honor even where Islam spread, often resulting in syncretism rather than full replacement &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Postcolonial Religious Conflict in Southeast Asia - Association for Asian Studies--&gt;https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/postcolonial-religious-conflict-in-southeast-asia/#:~:text=Southeast%20Asia%20is%20geographically%20and,heavily%20influenced%20by%20indigenous%20animist&lt;/ref&gt;. Overall, cultures that were '''open-textured and plural''' tended to maintain polytheism and complex writing systems, whereas cultures that embraced a single “high” tradition (be it monotheism or an efficient alphabet for sacred scripture) moved in those directions.

- '''Philosophical and Intellectual Factors:''' The prevailing philosophies and worldviews influenced how people thought about gods and language. In East Asia, Confucian and Taoist thought emphasized '''harmony, balance, and relativism''' rather than absolute binaries. As noted by one commentator, East Asian thought did not rigidly apply the “principle of the excluded middle” – people were comfortable thinking something could be *both/and* (both A and non-A) instead of *either/or* &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Natural Polytheism in China - The American Interest--&gt;https://www.the-american-interest.com/2011/11/30/natural-polytheism-in-china/#:~:text=years%20ago%2C%20a%20Japanese%20philosopher,natural%20polytheism&lt;/ref&gt;. This philosophical flexibility dovetailed with polytheism (many truths, many gods can coexist). In the West, by late antiquity, '''Greek philosophical ideas''' of an ultimate unity (One truth, One god) gained prominence, preparing minds for monotheism. Early Christian theologians like Augustine and Origen were themselves products of Greco-Roman philosophy, which helped articulate monotheism in philosophical terms. In South Asia, Hindu philosophy had the concept of a single divine reality (*Brahman*), but it expressed this unity through multiplicity (the thousands of gods are all faces of the One), showing a *philosophical reconciliation of polytheism and monism*. This reduced any impetus to abandon the many gods in favor of one. Regarding writing, philosophical attitudes toward language mattered too. The Chinese saw writing as part of the natural order – characters were believed to carry inherent meaning ('''logos'''), almost a sacred quality, in contrast to the more utilitarian view of writing in the West as a representation of spoken words. Thus, Chinese scholars often viewed their script as '''intrinsically linked to meaning and truth''', a notion that made an arbitrary alphabet seem less civilized. Western thinkers, from the ancient Greeks onward, developed alphabets alongside a philosophy of abstraction (breaking words into abstract letters), which mirrors their analytical approach to problems (breaking reality into fundamental units). In essence, philosophical orientations toward '''unity vs. plurality, and toward language''', had subtle but important influence on these developments.

- '''Linguistic Factors:''' The structure of languages and practical linguistic needs were fundamental. As discussed, the '''Chinese language''' (monosyllabic, tonal, many homophones) practically *required* a logographic script to distinctly represent its myriad morphemes &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Chinese writing | History, Characters &amp; Strokes | Britannica--&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-writing#:~:text=Although%20it%20was%20possible%20to,character%20would%20be%20extremely%20ambiguous&lt;/ref&gt;. An alphabetic writing for Chinese, while possible (as shown by modern pinyin), would need additional markers (tones, etc.) and still produce many ambiguous homographs – a hurdle that ancient Chinese overcame by sticking with characters. On the other hand, '''Latin''', '''Greek''', and Sanskrit had phonetic structures well-suited to alphabets (each sound clearly differentiates words). This made alphabets highly efficient in those contexts, spurring their adoption and spread. Moreover, the '''spread of literacy and scripture''' was affected by these writing systems. In the Roman Empire and its medieval successors, alphabets allowed for relatively easier schooling and copying of texts (a person could learn 20-30 letters and start writing any word). This facilitated the dissemination of '''holy texts''' like the Bible or Quran across language boundaries by translating them into local scripts (Latin, Gothic, Arabic, etc., all alphabetic). In East Asia, learning to read and write Chinese characters was a much more arduous process, generally limited to elites. As a result, '''religious texts''' (Buddhist sutras, for instance) were often transmitted through monasteries and oral teaching rather than mass-literacy of scriptures. This may have limited the reach of would-be proselytizing religions like Christianity, which rely on individual scripture reading in some traditions. Additionally, '''technology and linguistic complexity''' interacted: the earlier mentioned printing technology advantage of alphabetic scripts &lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Movable type - Wikipedia--&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type#:~:text=Around%201450%2C%20German%20goldsmith%20Johannes,9&lt;/ref&gt; meant that in early modern times, knowledge (including religious reformist ideas) spread faster in Europe than in China. Luther’s Reformation, for example, was propelled by printed vernacular Bibles and tracts, something less easily replicated in China with its writing system. Finally, linguistic identity is a factor – in India and Southeast Asia, new alphabets (Latin script under colonialism, or Arabic script with Islam) were sometimes introduced, but people often adapted them alongside or for specific purposes, while keeping indigenous scripts for their own languages. For instance, Vietnamese eventually adopted a Latin-based alphabet *quốc ngữ* (under French influence), but Thai, Burmese, Javanese, etc., held onto their Indic-derived alphabets. Each case was shaped by how well the new script fit the language and how strongly people felt about their traditional writing. In summary, '''language structure and practical communication needs''' strongly dictated writing system choices: where alphabets offered clarity and ease (as in the Mediterranean world), they flourished, but where they did not obviously improve communication (as in China), they failed to replace the established system.

'''Conclusion:''' The divergent paths of these civilizations illustrate that there is no single trajectory for religious or literary development; rather, each society’s choices were '''context-dependent'''. China and Japan remained polytheistic and logographic due to their entrenched cultural pluralism, statecraft, and linguistic pragmatics, whereas the Roman world’s shift to Christian monotheism and alphabetic literacy was propelled by its own unique blend of imperial ambitions, theological vision, and linguistic convenience. India and Southeast Asia demonstrate the tenacity of pluralistic traditions even under outside influence, highlighting how *adaptability and syncretism* can allow multiple systems—be it pantheons of gods or multiple scripts—to coexist. Together, these comparative cases provide rich material for understanding how politics, culture, philosophy, and language deeply shape the spiritual and intellectual character of civilizations across history.

It is based on two things in shinto:

# [[shinto:Hasshinden|Shinden]]: A shrine that is one of the [[:en:Three_Palace_Sanctuaries|Three Palace Sanctuaries]]. While originally only eight gods were enshrined there. It came to be that all the gods were enshrined there during the meiji period

However we use the translation of "Pantheon" in english because the word coming from Greek has an established meaning roughly similar

The Pantheon will have small Shintai preserving the gods of all the areas.

The term '''“closed practice”''' has gained prominence in recent years, especially within neo-pagan, witchcraft, and online spiritual communities. In broad terms, a closed practice refers to a '''religious or ritual practice that is restricted''' – typically to members of a particular culture, community, or lineage – and '''not freely open to everyone'''. As one pagan writer succinctly explains: ''“Closed practices are those that you can only be a part of if you were born into the community, or if you have been initiated into it.”'' &lt;ref&gt;https://thecritograph.com/2021/04/07/mystic-magic-closed-practices/#:~:text=Closed%20practices%20are%20those%20that,have%20been%20initiated%20into%20it&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, an “open” practice is accessible to anyone, while a “closed” practice requires some form of '''insider status''', whether by birth, heritage, or formal initiation&lt;ref&gt;https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1303&amp;context=honors#:~:text=,initiated%20into%20a%20closed%20religion&lt;/ref&gt;. This concept has become central in discussions of '''cultural appropriation''' and respect for boundaries in spirituality. It is especially emphasized in online spaces (Tumblr blogs, Discord groups, Reddit forums) where modern pagans and witches deliberate what practices outsiders should ''not'' partake in.

Importantly, the idea of closed practices is '''not an entirely new phenomenon'''. Many religions throughout history have drawn lines around who may participate in certain rituals or access certain knowledge. However, the ''language'' of “open vs. closed practice” – and the specific concerns about cultural theft or misuse – have emerged in particular force within '''20th–21st century discourse'''. This report examines the academic history and discussion of closed practices: from early critiques of “plastic shamans” in the 1970s–80s, through the term’s origin in neo-pagan communities, to contemporary online debates and scholarly analyses. We will also highlight well-documented examples of restricted rituals in world religions (such as Catholic sacraments, initiation rites, or lineage-based esoteric knowledge) to see how they compare to the modern label of a “closed practice.” Throughout, the focus will be on '''academic and anthropological perspectives''' – how scholars of religion, anthropology, and philosophy have articulated or critiqued the notion of closed practices – rather than on purely informal debate.

== Historical Origins: From “Plastic Shamans” to Cultural Protection ==
Issues of outsiders appropriating sacred traditions were already a point of contention by the late 20th century. In the 1970s and 1980s, as New Age spirituality and neo-shamanism grew in popularity, Native American communities began '''speaking out against the misuse of their ceremonies'''. Activists coined the term '''“plastic shaman”''' to denounce non-Native gurus and authors who profited from imitations of Indigenous rituals&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://web.mnstate.edu/robertsb/380/plastic%20shamans%20and%20astroturf%20sun%20dances.pdf#:~:text=plastic%20medicine%20men%20for%20hire,Bake%20Shamans%2C%E2%80%9D%20as%20some%20Na%02tive&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, anthropologist Lisa Aldred noted in 2000 that ''“Euro-Americans professing to be medicine people have profited from publications and workshops”'' selling purported Native wisdom&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. By the late 1980s, Native activists were directly confronting these exploiters: the American Indian Movement (AIM) even disrupted “plastic medicine men” workshops and publicly '''condemned those who profited from Native ceremonies&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'''. A famous statement from a 1993 gathering of Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota leaders – ''“A Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality”'' – declared ''“war against all persons who persist in exploiting, abusing, and misrepresenting the sacred traditions and spiritual practices”'' of Indigenous peoples&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=3&amp;psid=730&lt;/ref&gt;. This strong language underscored that certain rituals (e.g. the Lakota Sun Dance or sacred pipe ceremonies) were '''not meant for outsiders''', especially not for commercial gain.

Such activism laid an important foundation for the '''ethic of closed practices'''. The message was that Indigenous spiritual knowledge is ''not open-access'' and that unauthorized use by outsiders is a form of harm or '''colonial theft'''. Anthropologists and scholars took note of these developments. Aldred, for instance, described how New Age appropriation amounts to a ''“commercialization of Native American spirituality”'' and how Indigenous peoples’ objections were rooted in the feeling that their sacred traditions were being degraded and '''exploited by those with no real authority''' (00-N1644-FM) (00-N1644-FM). In effect, Native critics were asserting that these ceremonies are ''closed'' – to be conducted only by those within the culture or by persons explicitly sanctioned. This early discourse did not yet use the term “closed practice,” but it articulated the '''core principle''': ''not everything is free for outsiders to take''. As one commentator later summarized, ''“everything is not open property just because we wish it to be so… everything is not ours to take, everything is not ours to sell”''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://wildhunt.org/2014/11/culture-and-community-appropriation-exchange-and-modern-paganism.html#:~:text=that%20reminds%20us%20that%20everything,treasures%20are%20taken%20from%20a&lt;/ref&gt;.

These debates in the 1970s–90s predominantly involved '''Indigenous and New Age contexts''', but they influenced neo-pagan communities as well. Many neo-pagans in the 1960s–80s had freely borrowed from a variety of global traditions in forming new Witchcraft and Pagan practices. For example, modern Wicca – founded by Gerald Gardner mid-20th century – cobbled together elements from ceremonial magic, folk practices, Eastern philosophy, and even Indigenous lore (Mystic Magic: Closed Practices). By the 1980s, prominent Pagan authors like Starhawk and others were incorporating Native American terms (such as “smudging” with sage) or aspects of Afro-Caribbean religions into eclectic Witchcraft manuals. At the time, this syncretism was often seen as positive and creative. However, as '''post-colonial awareness grew''', some pagans began to question whether ''borrowing could become stealing''. The late 1980s and early 90s saw pagan writers start to acknowledge cultural appropriation as a problem. For instance, at the 1993 Parliament of the World’s Religions, Indigenous representatives forcefully criticized New Age and Pagan appropriations of their rites. This created a ripple effect: '''respect for closed traditions''' slowly entered the ethics of Pagan circles. By the mid-1990s, certain practices (like the sweat lodge, vision quest, or use of specific sacred herbs) were increasingly understood by Pagans to be '''off-limits unless one had proper permission or training'''. In essence, the concept of “closed practice” was germinating – even if it wasn’t yet called that – through these early cultural appropriation debates.

== Emergence of the Term in Neo-Pagan Communities ==
Within neo-pagan and witchcraft communities, the explicit terminology of '''“closed” vs. “open” practices''' seems to have crystallized in the 2000s and 2010s. Scholars note that by the 2010s, discussions of cultural appropriation had become ''“a central topic in the witch and neopagan community”'', especially online (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). An important study by Kathryn Gottlieb (2017) traced how this discourse evolved on the blogging platform Tumblr, which in the 2010s hosted a vibrant “witchblr” subculture. Gottlieb explains that neo-pagans began distinguishing '''open religions''' (those ''“available to everyone who wishes to practice them”'') from '''closed religions''' (those in which ''“one must be born or initiated”'' to participate) ([PDF] Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). In practice, community members were creating '''informal lists''' of which spiritual traditions or rituals were considered closed. A Reddit user’s explanation captures the emerging consensus: ''“A closed practice is any practice that requires some type of initiation to take part in. A well-known example would be Catholic communion – you must be baptized (initiated) to receive it.”'' (Which pagan practices are closed? - Reddit). While people often cite indigenous and magical traditions, this user’s example shows they were also framing even Christian sacraments in terms of “closed” access. The vocabulary of ''closed/open practice'' thus provided a new, simple heuristic: '''open = free for all; closed = requires invitation, initiation, or cultural belonging'''.

Online neo-pagan forums in the 2010s frequently debated specific cases. For example, many agreed that '''Native American spiritual ceremonies, Afro-Caribbean religions like Vodou and Santería, and Romani (Gypsy) folk practices''' were closed practices not open to outsiders (Which pagan practices are closed? - Reddit). An editorial on decolonizing paganism gives typical reasoning: ''Burning '''white sage''' and calling it “smudging” is closed to anyone who is not part of the Indigenous community'' (Mystic Magic: Closed Practices). The same author notes that '''Vodou''' and other African-based traditions are also closed: ''“Most of these practices are closed as well. To join Vodou, one must find a priest and commit to the practice. Like Kabbalah, it is not something that can just be [picked up casually]”'' (Mystic Magic: Closed Practices). Here we see two important factors that pagans consider: '''ancestry''' (being part of an indigenous community) and '''initiation under elders''' (finding a priest, being taught). If a person lacks those, the practice is deemed ''“not for you.”'' In line with this, many Tumblr posts admonished eclectic witches to '''avoid appropriating closed practices''' and to seek alternative, culturally appropriate substitutes. For instance, instead of smudging with white sage (a plant sacred to certain Native tribes), non-Native witches were encouraged to use other herbs for smoke cleansing, or simply refer to the act as generic '''“cleansing”''' rather than using the word “smudge” (Mystic Magic: Closed Practices). Terminology became a sensitive point: using the ''correct names'' and not claiming titles like “shaman” or “voodoo priest” without credentials was part of respecting closed traditions.

It’s noteworthy that '''neo-paganism itself has both open and closed dimensions'''. Some neopagan traditions are ''initiatory'' (for example, Gardnerian Wicca is famously '''closed to non-initiates''', with secret rituals and oath-bound lore). Others are more open and eclectic. This internal reality may have primed pagans to understand the closed/open distinction. As one occultist pointed out, ''“Gardnerian Wicca is a ‘closed’ practice – initiates only – … Buddhism was once initiates-only, as was early Christianity”'' (Feel like I will never meet other practitioners who DON’T steal from closed practises and religions. : r/occult). In other words, exclusivity in spiritual practice has precedent. However, what is new is the ''moral valuation'' attached to it. In online pagan discourse, labeling something a '''closed practice often carries a strong prescriptive tone''': outsiders ''should not'' partake, lest they commit cultural appropriation. This goes beyond simply “secret versus public” rites; it ties into '''social justice''' and anti-colonial ethics. One Tumblr user described the dynamic pointedly: ''“If you are integrating cultural practices from natives who are '''not open to sharing them''' with outsiders… you are appropriating – that is why we are discussing this term.”'' &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. In short, neo-pagans on platforms like Tumblr, Reddit, and Discord came to see guarding closed practices as a way to '''honor marginalized cultures''' and prevent the “theft” of spiritual resources by those in the dominant culture &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;http://animalarchaeology.com/2018/07/16/what-is-old-is-new-again-cultural-appropriation/#:~:text=However%2C%20this%20masks%20the%20negative,can%20recreate%20imperialistic%20power%20structures&lt;/ref&gt;.

Over the last decade, numerous '''online communities and resources sprung up to educate practitioners''' on this subject. Guides and blog posts enumerate which deities, herbs, rituals or symbols are off-limits unless you belong to the originating culture. For example, the Tumblr blog ''“hopeful spirits”'' regularly reminds readers that '''Gaelic polytheism is ''not''''' a closed practice – pushing back against a misconception that one must have Celtic blood to worship Irish gods. ''“Gaelic polytheism is not a closed practice. You do not need to be from Ireland, Scotland, or Man or have any ‘Celtic blood’ to worship the Gods, Ancestors, and Spirits,”'' one post states, adding that ''“Anyone who tells you different is misinformed at best or probably a racist at worst.”'' (hopeful spirits). This example highlights an important nuance: the closed practice discourse itself is '''contested and policed within the community'''. Some worry that calling a practice “closed” can slide into ethnic essentialism (e.g. saying only people of certain ancestry can participate, which can sound like a “blood and soil” ideology). Thus, even as many neo-pagans embrace the closed/open framework, there are internal debates about '''what falls where'''. Which traditions are truly closed? Who has the authority to say so? These questions continue to be hashed out on forums and group chats. Indeed, some online groups have banned the topic altogether to avoid fights – on Reddit’s r/witchcraft, moderators discourage “gatekeeping” discussions and treat any publicly available information as fair game for learning (Feel like I will never meet other practitioners who DON’T steal from closed practises and religions. : r/occult). This underscores that “closed practice” is not a unanimously agreed doctrine, but rather a '''living conversation''' in the community.

== Examples of Closed Practices in Religious Traditions ==
To better grasp what “closed practice” means, it is useful to look at concrete examples of '''restricted ritual or spiritual access''' across various religions. Many mainstream religious traditions have long maintained certain ''boundaries'' around who may participate in what – though their logic may differ from the modern neo-pagan usage. These examples will illustrate how '''diverse the forms of restriction''' can be, and how they sometimes align with, or differ from, the contemporary label ''“closed practice.”''

* '''Catholic Sacraments (Closed Communion):''' In Christianity, the idea of ''“closed communion”'' is centuries old. The Catholic Church, for instance, reserves the Eucharist (Holy Communion) for baptized Catholics in good standing. Non-Christians (and even Christians of other denominations) are not ordinarily permitted to receive the Eucharist at a Catholic Mass (Who Can Receive Holy Communion in the Catholic Church). As a Catholic explainer notes, ''“Non-Christians cannot receive Communion because they have not received baptism, the gateway to the other sacraments.”'' (Who Can Receive Holy Communion in the Catholic Church) This is a clear example of a '''functional restriction''' based on initiation – baptism is effectively an entry rite. Historically, the early Church was even more guarded: in antiquity, the unbaptized were literally ushered out of the church before the Eucharistic prayers began. The rationale here is theological (to protect the sanctity of the sacrament and ensure recipients understand its meaning) rather than stemming from cultural ownership. Anyone ''may'' become Catholic through conversion, and thereafter participate; thus the practice is closed in a '''membership sense''', but not ethnically. This shows a key difference: “closed” in the context of a church means ''“members only”'', whereas in neo-pagan cultural discourse, it often means ''“outsiders can never truly become insiders,”'' except perhaps by rare adoption or heritage.
* '''Jewish Traditions and Kabbalah:''' Some religions are ''ethnically'' inflected in their closed practices. Judaism does allow conversion, but it traditionally does not seek converts, and some esoteric aspects are discouraged for outsiders. For example, '''Kabbalah''', the mystical tradition in Judaism, was historically restricted to learned Jewish practitioners (often males over 40 who had mastered Torah and Talmud). In neo-pagan circles, one often hears that ''“Jewish witchcraft is closed; if you are not Jewish, you cannot use parts of Kabbalah.”'' (Mystic Magic: Closed Practices) Indeed, Jewish voices have objected to non-Jews casually appropriating Kabbalistic symbols or rituals. The pop-occult “Kabbalah Center” (with celebrity non-Jewish followers) drew criticism from rabbis for this reason. Here we see a case where '''lineage and religious identity blur''' – Kabbalah is closed because it is deeply embedded in the Jewish faith and Hebrew language. Without that context, one is missing the necessary initiation (in this case, being part of the covenant of Judaism). This example aligns with the modern closed-practice concept: it’s about '''cultural/religious ownership''' of a practice (Jews for Kabbalah, in this framing). Notably though, Judaism does permit conversion; a converted Jew would be as Jewish as any other and could partake of Kabbalah study in traditional settings. Thus, from an academic view, we might say Kabbalah is ''relatively'' closed – requiring entry into the community first.
* '''Initiation-Based Mystery Cults:''' Throughout history, many societies have had '''secret rites and mystery religions''' that only initiates could attend. A famous example is the '''Eleusinian Mysteries''' of ancient Greece. These were sacred rituals in honor of Demeter and Persephone, celebrated for nearly 2000 years, in which participants had to undergo an initiation and oath of secrecy. The rites and knowledge revealed at Eleusis were ''kept strictly secret'' from the uninitiated public (Eleusinian Mysteries - Wikipedia) (Eleusinian Mysteries | Initiation, Rites &amp; Cult - Britannica). Initiates from all over the Greek world (including women, men, free and enslaved persons of any ethnicity) could participate, but ''only'' if they underwent the prescribed initiation – and they were sworn not to reveal the Mysteries on pain of death. In modern terms, Eleusis was clearly a '''closed practice''': one could not simply walk in and observe without being part of the initiated group, and its “membership” was defined by ritual initiation rather than by culture or lineage. Academically, such cults are often termed '''“mystery religions”''' or '''“esoteric societies.”''' They illustrate that long before the current debates, '''religious secrecy and restricted access''' were common. The purpose was often to safeguard sacred knowledge and enhance group bonds. Similarly, in the '''Freemasonry''' fraternity (originating in the 18th century but drawing on older secret society models), one must be initiated through degrees to learn the inner rituals. These forms of closed practice are based on '''initiation and oath''' as the gatekeeping mechanism – conceptually similar to how neo-pagans describe “must be initiated” for, say, Haitian Vodou or Wicca.
* '''Lineage and Secret Societies in Indigenous Contexts:''' Anthropological literature is rich with examples of '''closed ceremonial societies''' in Indigenous cultures worldwide. In parts of West and Central Africa, for instance, societies like the '''Poro and Sande''' (in Sierra Leone, Liberia, etc.) or the '''Ogboni''' (among the Yoruba of Nigeria) are closed fraternities with secret rites. Members undergo rigorous initiations, and there are often penalties – even death – for insiders who divulge secrets to outsiders (2.cdr) (2.cdr). Knowledge in these societies is tiered: initiates learn progressively deeper secrets, and the uninitiated are not allowed to witness certain ceremonies at all. In many Australian Aboriginal communities, there are “men’s business” and “women’s business” rituals that are strictly segregated; only initiated men can see certain sacred objects or art, for example. Outsiders to the culture are generally ''never'' permitted access to these secret traditions, and even uninitiated community members may be excluded until undergoing the proper rites. Anthropologists have had to tread carefully – early ethnographers who published secret details earned lasting distrust. These indigenous secret-cult examples highlight a form of closed practice grounded in '''sacred secrecy and group identity'''. Unlike the neo-pagan discourse (which often centers on preventing ''cultural exploitation''), in these cases the concern is often '''cosmic or social order''' – i.e., that powerful ritual knowledge, if misused or revealed to the wrong people, could bring harm or lose its efficacy. Nonetheless, the net effect is similar: there are clear boundaries beyond which an outsider (or uninitiated person) ''must not cross''. The modern language of “closed practice” can certainly describe these scenarios.
* '''Initiatory African-Diaspora Religions:''' Religions like '''Haitian Vodou, Cuban Santería (Regla de Ocha), Candomblé, and Hoodoo/Rootwork''' often come up in current debates. These traditions are rooted in specific ethnic and historical experiences (e.g. Vodou in the Haitian context of former enslaved Africans and Catholic influence). They typically have '''formal initiation ceremonies (kanzo in Vodou, making Ocha in Santería, etc.)''' which induct a person into the priesthood or society of the religion. Without initiation, one might attend public ceremonies or be a client, but one is not a full practitioner. Importantly, these traditions ''do'' accept sincere outsiders in many lineages – there are white and non-African-descended priests of Vodou and Santería, for example, who were properly initiated. However, from the perspective of an outsider looking in (and certainly from the perspective of ''internet discourse''), Vodou and related faiths are considered '''closed practices'''. You cannot simply read a book and declare yourself a Vodou priest; you must go through the community’s own channels (Mystic Magic: Closed Practices). Practically, this is an initiation-based restriction akin to the Eleusinian example, but it’s also bound up with '''cultural identity''' (since these faiths carry the heritage of marginalized peoples). Scholars of religion point out that such traditions manage a '''balance between openness and protection''': they often welcome ''genuine seekers'' who apprentice under a house and undergo the rites, but they strongly reject dilettantes or commercial exploiters. Indeed, the very term “'''Hoodoo'''” in African-American communities has an element of closed secrecy – for generations it was practiced quietly within black communities, and knowledge was passed down in families or mentor relationships, kept out of mainstream view. Today, one sees debates (especially on platforms like TikTok or Tumblr) about whether non-black practitioners can or should do Hoodoo; many black American practitioners assert it is a '''closed practice belonging to African-American heritage''', cautioning outsiders against cherry-picking spells or sacred songs from it.
* '''“Conversion-Restricted” Religions:''' Some entire religions are traditionally ''closed'' in the sense that they do not accept converts or make it exceedingly difficult. For example, the '''Parsi Zoroastrians''' (Indian Zoroastrians descended from Persian immigrants) historically do not admit new converts – one must be born into a Zoroastrian family to be recognized. Similarly, certain Hindu temples or sects have rules barring non-Hindus from entering sacred precincts (e.g. the Jagannath Temple in Puri, India prohibits non-Hindus from entry). These cases are about '''ethnic or hereditary criteria''' for participation. They complicate the neat open/closed binary: Is Hindu worship “closed” or “open”? Hinduism as a whole has no conversion sacrament and is broad, but specific lineages and temple communities may be closed to outsiders. Anthropologist Michael Lambek and others have noted that some cultures conceive religion as an inalienable inheritance – ''you can’t just adopt it at will''. This outlook resonates with the neo-pagan insistence that ''certain practices belong to a people'' and outsiders can’t just help themselves. However, it’s worth noting that many world religions have ''opened up over time'' – for instance, '''Buddhism''' in its early monastic form required joining the sangha (monastery) to fully practice, but today it is quite “open” globally with many non-Asian adherents (though even Buddhism retains esoteric initiations in Vajrayana/Tantric contexts).

In summary, examples across the world reveal ''multiple dimensions'' of why a practice might be closed: '''sacred secrecy, initiation status, ethnic lineage, doctrinal purity, or cultural survival'''. The modern label “closed practice” in online discourse tends to blur some of these distinctions, treating them all under one umbrella of “not for outsiders.” Scholars find this both useful and problematic – useful as a shorthand for talking about '''power and permission''' in spirituality, but potentially oversimplifying very different scenarios. The Catholic communion example, for instance, is often cited in pagan forums as a “closed practice” (Which pagan practices are closed? - Reddit), which is true in one sense, though the Church’s reasoning has nothing to do with cultural appropriation. Likewise, someone might argue that if ''all'' practices requiring initiation are “closed,” then even things like Reiki (which has attunements) or certain forms of Yoga could be considered closed. Clearly, context matters.

== Contemporary Online Discourse and Community Dynamics ==
The rise of social media platforms dedicated to witchcraft and paganism (Tumblr’s #witchblr, various Discord servers, subreddits like r/witchcraft and r/pagan) has amplified the discussion of closed practices. These online communities have become '''key sites for both the promotion and the challenging of the concept'''. Ethnographic studies and firsthand accounts indicate that newcomers often learn about closed practices through community guidelines and veteran members. In interviews conducted on the role of online communities for witches, participants noted encountering '''strong moral norms''' against appropriation. Some experienced users took it upon themselves to correct or even scold those seen using closed practices in ignorance (“In the broom closet”: exploring the role of online communities in shaping the identities of contemporary witchcraft practitioners | Current Psychology ) (“In the broom closet”: exploring the role of online communities in shaping the identities of contemporary witchcraft practitioners | Current Psychology ). For example, a new witch posting about burning sage might be met with comments explaining the Native context of smudging and suggesting alternative herbs. While this can be educational, researchers have observed it can also veer into '''policing and gatekeeping''' that ''“was generally perceived as off-putting, particularly for those who were new to witchcraft.”'' (“In the broom closet”: exploring the role of online communities in shaping the identities of contemporary witchcraft practitioners | Current Psychology ) The zeal to enforce respect for closed practices sometimes turns into what one study participant described as ''“moral preaching”'' that could alienate newcomers (“In the broom closet”: exploring the role of online communities in shaping the identities of contemporary witchcraft practitioners | Current Psychology ). In a 2022 study of online witch identities (Frampton &amp; Grandison 2023), some interviewees reported witnessing “bullying of newly practicing witches” over issues like using the wrong terminology or inadvertently invoking a closed practice (“In the broom closet”: exploring the role of online communities in shaping the identities of contemporary witchcraft practitioners | Current Psychology ) (“In the broom closet”: exploring the role of online communities in shaping the identities of contemporary witchcraft practitioners | Current Psychology ). Moderators of groups often have to walk a fine line between '''allowing discussion''' of these issues and preventing flame wars.

There is also a generational or subcultural divide in attitudes. Broadly, the '''Tumblr-born discourse''' of closed practices has been championed by many younger or more socially progressive practitioners, whereas some older or more traditional occultists bristle at what they see as rigid rules. This tension is evident in online arguments. For instance, on Reddit’s r/occult, one user argued that ''“most ‘closed practice’ claims are just veiled racism”'' – an expression of frustration that the concept can become too tied to race and ancestry (Feel like I will never meet other practitioners who DON’T steal from closed practises and religions. : r/occult). He pointed out that historically, religions spread through contact and that ''“clinging to long dead traditions”'' and keeping them closed might not be practical or necessary (Feel like I will never meet other practitioners who DON’T steal from closed practises and religions. : r/occult). On the other hand, many practitioners of color and their allies emphasize that '''power imbalances''' in society make these boundaries necessary. A common refrain is that when a dominant-culture person takes on a minority’s sacred practice without permission, it ''perpetuates the colonial pattern'' of exploitation&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. In one blog, this is phrased as ''“an outsider... gains from their use of practices that are not rightfully theirs, which in effect can recreate imperialistic power structures”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''. Online community ethos often leans toward protecting those who have historically been disempowered in spiritual conversations.

Interestingly, some platforms have institutionalized positions on the matter. As noted, '''Reddit’s r/witchcraft''' decided to consider the sharing of any information that is publicly available (in books or online) as “open,” effectively disallowing users from trying to gatekeep others based on closed practice arguments (Feel like I will never meet other practitioners who DON’T steal from closed practises and religions. : r/occult). This policy was an attempt to reduce infighting. It suggests that while the majority acknowledges closed practices conceptually, ''enforcing'' that norm in a large, diverse online group can be contentious. Meanwhile, specialized groups – for example, a Discord server specifically for Afro-diasporic religions – may have strict rules reflecting closed status (e.g. only initiates can teach certain things, outsiders should ask permission to observe chats, etc.). Thus, online discourse is not monolithic; it is an evolving negotiation. Scholars following these trends sometimes liken it to earlier phenomena of '''internet “flame wars” and norm formation''', but with a new dimension of social justice language.

Despite the debates, the closed practice concept has definitely ''shaped behavior'' in these communities. Many well-intentioned eclectic practitioners now carefully '''vet their practices''': ''Is this symbol from a culture I have no connection to?'', ''Did I learn this chant from a closed tradition?'', ''Do I have the right to use this deity’s name or should I seek a teacher first?'' This self-scrutiny is a marked change from, say, the 1990s when a neo-pagan might cheerfully mix Navajo chant with Celtic rites without a second thought. One tangible outcome is the creation of '''alternative rituals and vocabularies''', as mentioned earlier. A neopagan might opt for a '''“land acknowledgment”''' to honor Native peoples rather than appropriating a smudging ritual; or use the term “'''smoke cleansing'''” instead of “smudging” and choose local herbs to burn (Mystic Magic: Closed Practices). Another example is crafting new ceremonies inspired by indigenous ones but not copying them – e.g. doing a generic four-directions salute in a Wiccan circle, but ''not'' using the exact prayers of the Lakota Sun Dance. These adaptations are sometimes shared online as “'''culturally respectful alternatives'''.” Gottlieb’s research on Tumblr witches found that community members actively developed such alternatives and '''“neutralization techniques”''' – essentially justifications or modifications to avoid the stigma of appropriation (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). In her interviews, some pagans described feeling guilty when they discovered a practice they had been doing might be closed, and then taking steps to change their practice or seek proper permission.

== Scholarly Perspectives and Critiques ==
Academic engagement with the closed practice concept has grown in tandem with its spread in popular discourse. Scholars of contemporary religion, anthropology, and philosophy have approached the issue from several angles:

* '''Understanding the Discourse:''' Researchers have worked to document ''how and why'' the closed-practice idea took hold. Kathryn Gottlieb’s 2017 thesis (University of Maine) was an early scholarly work devoted to this, titled ''“Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft.”'' She examined '''Tumblr discussions''' and interviewed practitioners to understand the discourse’s impact (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). Her study situates the closed-practice debate in the broader history of modern witchcraft, noting that neopaganism’s eclectic roots were being re-evaluated through a lens of cultural sensitivity. She also noted the development of ''“alternative terminologies”'' (like saying ''“cleansing”'' instead of ''“smudging”'') as the community’s response to recognizing a practice as closed (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). This indicates a conscious shift in the community’s identity – an example of what anthropologists call '''reflexive self-regulation''': the community is modifying itself based on ethical reflections. Gottlieb’s work treats the topic seriously, validating that ''this is a significant conversation that tells us about the evolution of modern Pagan values.''
* '''Critical Theory and Power:''' Scholars like Sabina Magliocco (a folklorist/anthropologist) and Amy Hale have discussed appropriation and closed practices in terms of '''power dynamics and authenticity'''. An important point made in academic circles is that cultural appropriation is ''not equivalent to mere cultural exchange'' – it crucially involves '''exploitation and unequal power''' (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium). As anthropologist Amy Hale puts it, ''“Cultural appropriation is not the same as cultural borrowing. Appropriation involves exploitation and differentials in power relations.”'' (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium) In other words, when a majority-culture person adopts a minority culture’s spiritual practice without permission, it’s qualitatively different from two cultures freely sharing with mutual respect. This theoretical framing supports why closed practices ''should'' be respected in many cases – to avoid reinforcing historic inequalities. Furthermore, some scholars tie this to the concept of '''cultural heritage rights'''. There is a growing recognition (even in international law, like UNESCO conventions and the U.N. Declaration on Indigenous Rights) that communities have a right to protect and control their intangible cultural heritage, including sacred rituals. The closed practice ethos can be seen as a grassroots reflection of that principle. It is a form of what some philosophers might call '''“cultural privacy”''' or '''“epistemic self-determination”''' – the idea that a culture can choose how and with whom its sacred knowledge is shared.
* '''Critiques of Essentialism:''' On the other hand, scholars have also critiqued the closed-practice discourse when it becomes too rigid or '''essentialist'''. Amy Hale, for example, while acknowledging the realities of appropriation, warns against an overly zealous focus on cultural purity. ''“Cultural artifacts survive and thrive through transmission and contact,”'' she notes, and it is acceptable for cultures to exchange in healthy ways (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium). Hale argues that demanding perfect purity of lineage for every practice is historically untenable – ''“perfect unbroken transmission is nearly impossible to find with any cultural expression”'' (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium). She cautions that ''“focusing on cultural purity and origins leads to disappointment at best and Nazis at worst.”'' (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium) This provocative statement highlights the danger of a “bloodline-based” approach: it can slide into the same kind of exclusivist thinking that extremist ethnonationalists use. In scholarly terms, Hale and others critique what they call '''reification of culture''' – treating cultures as sealed, static entities. Modern anthropological consensus is that cultures are dynamic, and syncretism (the blending of practices) has been a constant in religious history. Therefore, a blanket interdiction on participating in another culture’s practice might ignore contexts where sharing is welcomed or where identities are mixed. Anthropologist Sabina Magliocco has similarly noted that '''too narrow a view of authenticity''' can be problematic. She observed that some neo-pagans and indigenous groups form alliances and share practices in good faith, complicating the simple open/closed binary (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium). For instance, some Celtic Reconstructionist pagans have respectfully learned from living Celtic folk traditions – is that appropriation or just revival? The answer may depend on perspective.
* '''Contested Boundaries – Academic Analysis:''' A very recent scholarly contribution is a chapter by Apoorvaa Joshi and Ethel Brooks (2025) entitled ''“Whose Craft?: Contentions on Open and Closed Practice in Contemporary Witchcraft(s)”''. This appears in ''The Witch Studies Reader'' (Duke University Press, 2025) and explicitly tackles the debates around open vs. closed practices. The authors describe '''“contested boundaries”''' in the witchcraft community, noting that ''“one such boundary, and the focus of this chapter, is the discussion around ‘open’ and ‘closed’ practices.”'' (Whose Craft?Contentions on Open and Closed Practice in ...). While we only have a preview of their work, it’s clear that academic interest has recognized this as a '''hot-button issue that encapsulates deeper questions''': who “owns” spiritual knowledge? How do decolonial and feminist perspectives influence modern witchcraft? Preliminary information suggests Joshi and Brooks approach it from a '''critical decolonial feminist perspective''', examining how debates on closed practice intersect with issues of race, colonial history, and the self-definition of witches outside Eurocentric narratives (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft) (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). The very title “Whose Craft?” signals the core question of ownership and belonging. Scholars like them likely argue that the closed-practice discourse is part of a larger '''reckoning with colonialism in contemporary Paganism''' – an effort to “decenter Europe,” uplift suppressed indigenous voices, and challenge the free-for-all universalist approach that older occultism sometimes took (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). At the same time, by calling them “contentions,” they acknowledge this is not settled; it’s an evolving negotiation of identity in modern witchcraft.
* '''Ethical and Philosophical Debates:''' Philosophers of religion and ethicists have also weighed in indirectly by discussing '''cultural appropriation ethics'''. One debate is how to balance ''respect for closed practices'' with the values of ''individual spiritual freedom''. Western liberal thought generally supports the idea that individuals can explore any religion. Yet, the closed practice idea posits that moral constraints exist on that freedom out of respect for communities. This is a tension between '''individualism and collective rights'''. Some philosophers argue that if an outsider approaches a tradition humbly, learns the language, even converts or is initiated properly, then morally there is no issue – the practice is no longer “stolen” but rather '''shared with consent'''. Others note that power imbalances complicate the possibility of genuine consent (e.g., an economically pressured shaman might “share” sacred rituals for money, but is that true consent or coerced by circumstances?). In sum, academic discussions probe questions like: ''Can spiritual knowledge be owned?'' ''Is restricting spiritual practices a form of necessary protection or a problematic gatekeeping?'' These remain open questions with thoughtful arguments on both sides.
* '''Lived Reality and Complexity:''' Ethnographers who study particular communities often find that the reality of how practices are shared or closed is quite nuanced. For example, an anthropologist studying Haitian Vodou might find that ''within Haiti'', Vodou priests are proud to initiate foreigners who show respect – hence from their perspective Vodou isn’t “closed” in a racial sense, though it ''is'' closed in that you must go through the proper initiation. Meanwhile, on the internet, one sees non-Haitians doing pseudo-Vodou spells without initiation – which ''is'' offensive to the community. Thus the issue is not that outsiders can ''never'' join, but that they must do so '''on the community’s terms'''. Scholars like Erin Taylor and Elizabeth Perez (who have studied Afro-Caribbean traditions) emphasize the importance of '''relationship and permission'''. A practice might be ''conditionally open'' – if you build a relationship with the culture, you may be welcomed – but it remains ''closed to casual appropriation''. This nuance sometimes gets lost in heated online exchanges. Anthropologist Sabina Magliocco has observed that in some cases neo-pagans have responsibly engaged with indigenous teachers and received permission to adapt certain practices, muddying any simplistic categorization of that practice as strictly “closed” or “open.”

In conclusion, the academic framing of closed practices tends to support the '''intent''' behind the concept – protecting vulnerable cultures from exploitation – while also urging a '''critical, nuanced approach'''. Scholars often encourage moving beyond slogans to ask: ''Who sets the boundaries? How do power and history play in?'' They also draw parallels to similar concepts in other domains, such as intellectual property rights, secrecy in ritual, and cultural revival movements. There is a recognition that the closed-practice discourse is ''part of a broader decolonization trend'' in spirituality. As one commentator noted, the effort to avoid appropriation forces modern Pagans to learn more about the '''“cultural &amp; historical context”''' of traditions, making them more educated and respectful practitioners overall (hopeful spirits) (hopeful spirits). This educational silver lining is something scholars praise – it pushes practitioners toward genuine intercultural understanding rather than shallow borrowing.

== Conclusion ==
The concept of “closed practices” in religion has evolved from a niche concern of indigenous activists into a wide-ranging discussion that engages neo-pagan communities, internet subcultures, and academic thinkers. Its '''historical roots''' lie in legitimate grievances over cultural exploitation – epitomized by the “plastic shaman” backlash and declarations by Native Americans to protect their sacred traditions. From there, neo-pagans (especially in the 2010s) adopted the terminology of ''closed vs. open'' practices as a way to navigate the ethics of borrowing in a post-colonial world. This framework has since permeated online discourse: on Tumblr dashboards and Discord chats, one finds young witches learning that some practices (like smudging, Hoodoo, or Kabbalah) are ''“closed – not for outsiders”''. They also learn that other practices (like Celtic polytheism or Wicca) are more open, or that proper initiation can grant entry across the threshold.

Academically, this phenomenon has been met with both affirmation and critique. '''Anthropologists and scholars of religion largely affirm the importance of respecting the wishes of source communities''', noting that cultural appropriation is harmful when it involves power imbalances and disrespect (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium) (Not For You: Cultural Appropriation in Neo-Paganism and How Archaeology Plays a Role – Animal Archaeology). At the same time, they caution against simplistic absolutism. Culture and religion are dynamic; one era’s closed practice may later spread legitimately through cross-cultural exchange (consider Buddhism’s travel from India across Asia, or Yoga’s global diffusion). The challenge, as scholars frame it, is to ensure '''mutual respect and consent''' guide any adoption of practices. As philosopher James O. Young wrote in a related context, the morality of using another culture’s art or rituals depends on factors like whether the source community consents or is harmed – not merely on the fact of cross-cultural use itself (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium) (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium).

From Catholic communion to Yoruba secret societies, we see that restricting spiritual practices is an age-old aspect of human societies – sometimes for internal theological reasons, sometimes as a shield against outside interference. The ''modern notion'' of a closed practice brings in an additional moral dimension: it asks, ''“By partaking in this practice, am I violating someone’s cultural sovereignty or trust?”'' This question has undoubtedly made modern Pagans more conscientious. It has sparked intense debates, but also deeper research and self-examination. '''Functional restrictions''' (like initiation requirements) and '''cultural boundaries''' (like ethnic lineage) both inform the label, and sometimes lead to overzealous claims (e.g. the erroneous idea that one needs “Celtic blood” to honor Celtic gods, rightly called out as misguided (hopeful spirits)). Yet at its best, the closed-practice discourse encourages a kind of '''ethical spirituality''' – one that strives to practice in a way that is both authentic to oneself ''and'' respectful toward the cultures one draws from.

In the online world, this discourse continues to develop. We now see community-generated lists of what’s closed, nuanced discussions about specific cases (e.g. ''Is Reiki a closed practice since it was once secret in Japan?''; ''Can non-Indigenous people participate in Ayahuasca ceremonies if invited?''; etc.), and even some fatigue and backlash in parts of the community. The push and pull will likely continue, but it has unquestionably altered the landscape of contemporary Pagan and New Age practice. A new practitioner in 2025 is far more likely to think twice about burning white sage or calling themselves a shaman than one in 1985 – a testament to the influence of this concept.

From an academic perspective, the conversation around closed practices is valuable because it forces recognition of '''historical injustices and the need for cultural humility'''. It also raises fascinating questions about the nature of tradition, ownership, and the transmission of knowledge. Scholars will undoubtedly keep studying online pagan forums and real-world communities to see how these ideas play out. As one recent volume on witchcraft studies put it, these debates are part of ''“decentering Europe”'' and challenging old paradigms in understanding witchcraft and religion (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). In plain terms, the closed practice concept is one way marginalized voices are asserting their agency in the spiritual realm – saying ''“this is ours, handle with care.”''

Ultimately, most scholars and practitioners can agree on a middle ground principle: '''context and respect are everything'''. If a practice truly belongs to a living community that considers it closed, outsiders face an ethical mandate to honor that – whether that means abstaining or approaching through proper channels. Conversely, assuming every spiritual element is proprietary can lead to absurd or counterproductive outcomes. The key is ongoing dialogue, education, and empathy. The emergence of the closed practice concept, with all its contentions, has already prompted such dialogue on a wide scale – from academic conferences to coven meetings. It is an evolving example of how modern religious movements grapple with the legacy of colonialism and the meaning of authenticity in an interconnected world.

      <text bytes="27139" sha1="3nqtly2k9y81n7ij95l21fe4e4rvzzl" xml:space="preserve">Neuroimaging research reveals both commonalities and contrasts in brain activation when processing logographic versus alphabetic scripts. All proficient readers engage a core '''reading network''' that includes the '''visual word form area''' (VWFA) in the left occipitotemporal cortex for recognizing written shapes, along with left-hemisphere language areas​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-use-same-brain-regions-to-read-alphabetic-and-logographic-languages/#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence%20that%20for,that%20are%20engaged%20for%20writing&lt;/ref&gt;

. However, '''logographic reading''' (e.g. Chinese) places additional demands on certain regions compared to '''alphabetic reading''' (e.g. English or French):

* '''Frontal vs. Temporal Lobe Emphasis:''' Reading Chinese characters elicits greater activation of the left '''middle frontal gyrus (MFG)''', whereas reading alphabetic text relies more on left '''temporoparietal''' regions​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316271209_Rethinking_the_function_of_brain_regions_for_reading_Chinese_characters_in_a_meta-analysis_of_fMRI_studies#:~:text=Neuroimaging%20studies%20have%20proposed%20specific,summarized%20brain%20regions%20in%20previous&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15343334/#:~:text=Developmental%20dyslexia%20is%20characterized%20by,impaired%20Chinese%20children%20and%20associated&lt;/ref&gt;. The left posterior superior temporal gyrus (part of Wernicke’s area) is strongly engaged during alphabetic reading for phonemic decoding, but in Chinese reading it shows minimal activation&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316271209_Rethinking_the_function_of_brain_regions_for_reading_Chinese_characters_in_a_meta-analysis_of_fMRI_studies#:~:text=Neuroimaging%20studies%20have%20proposed%20specific,summarized%20brain%20regions%20in%20previous&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, Chinese literacy recruits the left MFG as a center for iintegrating character information (visual form, sound, meaning) in working memory&lt;ref&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15343334/#:~:text=controls%2C%20that%20functional%20disruption%20of,in%20verbal%20and%20spatial%20working&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, neuropsychological studies of dyslexia highlight this difference: impaired reading in alphabetic scripts is linked to dysfunction of left temporoparietal areas (affecting grapheme-to-phoneme conversion), whereas Chinese dyslexia is associated with disruption of left MFG, which coordinates written characters in verbal and '''spatial''' working memory&lt;ref&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15343334/#:~:text=Developmental%20dyslexia%20is%20characterized%20by,impaired%20Chinese%20children%20and%20associated&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15343334/#:~:text=controls%2C%20that%20functional%20disruption%20of,in%20verbal%20and%20spatial%20working&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Visual–Motor Integration:''' Logographic reading/writing engages brain networks involved in '''motor planning''' to a greater extent. Studies show that '''Chinese readers''' activate premotor cortex (e.g. Exner’s area) and associated motor “gestural” regions during reading​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-use-same-brain-regions-to-read-alphabetic-and-logographic-languages/#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence%20that%20for,that%20are%20engaged%20for%20writing&lt;/ref&gt;. This reflects the importance of stroke order and handwritten form in Chinese – reading a character implicitly calls on knowledge of how it is written. Indeed, '''fMRI''' comparisons indicate that Chinese '''handwriting''' tasks produce stronger left MFG and premotor activation than writing in alphabetic languages&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316271209_Rethinking_the_function_of_brain_regions_for_reading_Chinese_characters_in_a_meta-analysis_of_fMRI_studies#:~:text=Neuroimaging%20studies%20have%20proposed%20specific,summarized%20brain%20regions%20in%20previous&lt;/ref&gt;. In contrast, '''alphabetic literacy''' more heavily engages auditory-phonological circuits (the “ear” component of reading)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-use-same-brain-regions-to-read-alphabetic-and-logographic-languages/#:~:text=The%20researchers%20found%20that%20both,different%20demands%20of%20each%20language&lt;/ref&gt;, since decoding is based on mapping letters to sounds. In sum, reading in all scripts activates visual shape recognition areas, but '''alphabetic reading''' leans on phonological processing regions (temporal lobe), whereas '''logographic reading''' recruits additional frontoparietal resources for visuo-spatial analysis and motor memory of orthographic patterns&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-use-same-brain-regions-to-read-alphabetic-and-logographic-languages/#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence%20that%20for,that%20are%20engaged%20for%20writing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15343334/#:~:text=controls%2C%20that%20functional%20disruption%20of,in%20verbal%20and%20spatial%20working&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Hemispheric and Connectivity Differences:''' Some studies suggest that processing intricate logographic characters involves more bilateral visual regions or right-hemisphere contribution (due to the pictorial complexity), although the '''“universal” reading network''' largely overlaps for both script types​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-use-same-brain-regions-to-read-alphabetic-and-logographic-languages/#:~:text=Learning%20to%20read%20Chinese%20might,the%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-use-same-brain-regions-to-read-alphabetic-and-logographic-languages/#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence%20that%20for,that%20are%20engaged%20for%20writing&lt;/ref&gt;.  A meta-analysis of Chinese character reading found a broadly shared left-hemisphere network for word recognition across languages, but noted greater involvement of left fusiform and angular gyrus for Chinese under certain tasks&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316271209_Rethinking_the_function_of_brain_regions_for_reading_Chinese_characters_in_a_meta-analysis_of_fMRI_studies#:~:text=shared%20network%20for%20the%20two,shed%20light%20on%20the%20language&lt;/ref&gt;. These differences likely reflect the extra '''semantic and visuo-orthographic processing''' required for Chinese characters (which map onto morphemes and carry meaning even as single units). Overall, while readers of alphabetic and logographic systems utilize similar neural centers, the '''degree and focus of activation''' shifts to accommodate the script: alphabetic reading centers on sequential phonological assembly, whereas logographic reading adds demands on visuo-spatial analysis and memory integration in frontal cortex&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316271209_Rethinking_the_function_of_brain_regions_for_reading_Chinese_characters_in_a_meta-analysis_of_fMRI_studies#:~:text=Neuroimaging%20studies%20have%20proposed%20specific,summarized%20brain%20regions%20in%20previous&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15343334/#:~:text=controls%2C%20that%20functional%20disruption%20of,in%20verbal%20and%20spatial%20working&lt;/ref&gt;

== Working Memory, Spatial Reasoning, and Visual Processing ==
The cognitive demands of logographic vs. alphabetic systems differ in how they tax '''working memory''' and visual-spatial processing. Logographic writing (like Chinese or Japanese Kanji) emphasizes handling complex two-dimensional configurations, whereas alphabetic writing (like English or Arabic) emphasizes linear sequences of symbols. Key differences include:

* '''Verbal vs. Visuo-Spatial Working Memory:''' Alphabetic literacy relies heavily on '''phonological working memory''' – readers must hold sequences of letters or phonemes in mind and map them to sounds. In contrast, logographic literacy engages '''visuo-spatial working memory''' to a greater extent​&lt;ref&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15343334/#:~:text=controls%2C%20that%20functional%20disruption%20of,in%20verbal%20and%20spatial%20working&lt;/ref&gt;. Fluent Chinese reading requires remembering the spatial arrangement of strokes and radicals within characters while linking them to syllables and meanings. Neuroscientists note that the left MFG activation in Chinese reading corresponds to the coordination of information in '''verbal and spatial memory buffers''' during character recognition&lt;ref&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15343334/#:~:text=controls%2C%20that%20functional%20disruption%20of,in%20verbal%20and%20spatial%20working&lt;/ref&gt;. Empirical studies show that phonological awareness (so critical for English reading) is less predictive for learning Chinese; instead, '''visual-orthographic skills''' play a larger role in Chinese reading acquisition&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-0859-5_3#:~:text=Phonological%20Awareness%20in%20Chinese%20Reading,more%20important%20in%20Chinese&lt;/ref&gt;For example, preschool visual skills like shape discrimination and memory span strongly predict later ability to learn characters&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001002779400641W#:~:text=,alphabetic%20script%20such%20as%20English&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-0859-5_3#:~:text=Phonological%20Awareness%20in%20Chinese%20Reading,more%20important%20in%20Chinese&lt;/ref&gt;, whereas English learners lean more on letter-sound awareness.
* '''Visual Discrimination and Memory:''' Because a single logographic character can be intricate, readers of logographic scripts develop acute '''visual discrimination''' abilities. Chinese characters are composed of strokes arranged in precise spatial configurations, so even minor changes can alter meaning. Children learning to read Chinese show a strong correlation between their visual-spatial skills and character reading performance​&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240277642_Spatial_Memory_for_Chinese_and_English#:~:text=visual%20spatial%20memory%20in%20Chinese, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240277642_Spatial_Memory_for_Chinese_and_English#:~:text=visual%20spatial%20memory%20in%20Chinese,]&lt;/ref&gt;. In one study, Chinese kindergartners’ ability to analyze visual patterns (spatial relations) was strongly associated with character recognition skill&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240277642_Spatial_Memory_for_Chinese_and_English#:~:text=visual%20spatial%20memory%20in%20Chinese, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240277642_Spatial_Memory_for_Chinese_and_English#:~:text=visual%20spatial%20memory%20in%20Chinese,]&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, bilingual individuals literate in Chinese have been found to outperform monolingual English speakers on tests of visual memory. Tavassoli (2002) reported that Chinese–English bilinguals had significantly better visuo-spatial memory than English monolinguals, suggesting that learning a logographic script '''facilitates visual–spatial memory''' development&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240277642_Spatial_Memory_for_Chinese_and_English#:~:text=...%20Mcbride, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240277642_Spatial_Memory_for_Chinese_and_English#:~:text=...%20Mcbride,]&lt;/ref&gt;. Indeed, a number of studies have shown that native readers of logographic systems '''outperform alphabetic readers on visual memory tasks''' – including memory for abstract shapes, spatial configurations, and visuo-spatial working memory tasks&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240277642_Spatial_Memory_for_Chinese_and_English#:~:text=,Hsu%2C%201985%3BStevenson%20%26%20Ying&lt;/ref&gt;. The experience of memorizing thousands of characters (each a complex visual pattern) appears to cultivate a more efficient visual processing system for remembering shapes&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240277642_Spatial_Memory_for_Chinese_and_English#:~:text=,Hsu%2C%201985%3BStevenson%20%26%20Ying&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Spatial Reasoning Skills:''' Along with memory, general spatial reasoning and visual–spatial '''problem-solving''' may be enhanced by logographic literacy. Cross-cultural research has noted that people from logographic literacy backgrounds often excel at tasks requiring spatial analysis or mental imagery​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240277642_Spatial_Memory_for_Chinese_and_English#:~:text=,Hsu%2C%201985%3BStevenson%20%26%20Ying&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in comparative studies, Chinese participants showed better performance on spatial visualization and mental rotation tasks than their Western counterparts, which some researchers attribute in part to the cognitive training of character-based reading&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240277642_Spatial_Memory_for_Chinese_and_English#:~:text=,Hsu%2C%201985%3BStevenson%20%26%20Ying&lt;/ref&gt;. By contrast, alphabetic literacy places relatively less demand on fine-grained spatial analysis – letters occupy a linear sequence and have simple shapes, and once the small set of letters is learned, reading new words is mostly a phonological decoding task. Thus, '''working memory load''' in alphabetic reading is more on the temporal order of sounds, whereas in logographic reading it is on maintaining visual-spatial patterns. Educational psychologists echo this: learning to read English hinges on phonemic segmentation and auditory memory, while learning Chinese requires keen visual memory for orthography and awareness of subtle spatial arrangements in characters&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001002779400641W#:~:text=,alphabetic%20script%20such%20as%20English&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001002779400641W#:~:text=,alphabetic%20script%20such%20as%20English&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Eye Movements and Processing Span:''' The format of the script also affects visual processing during reading. Logographic text (e.g. Chinese) typically has no spaces between characters, and each character conveys a syllable or word, leading to different eye-movement patterns than spaced alphabetic text. Chinese readers tend to take in one or two characters per fixation (often processing them as a unit of meaning), and their perceptual span (the range of vision that is useful for reading) may be more balanced vertically and horizontally given the block-like shape of characters. Alphabetic readers, in contrast, scan text left-to-right and use spaces to segment words, which may allow a wider horizontal perceptual span but requires sequential letter processing within each word. These differences in visual processing demands reinforce the distinct cognitive skills each system exercises – '''sequential scanning''' for alphabetic scripts versus '''spatial pattern recognition''' for logographs.

== Holistic vs. Analytical Cognitive Processing ==
A long-standing hypothesis in cognitive psychology is that logographic and alphabetic writing systems encourage different styles of thought – often framed as '''holistic vs. analytical cognition'''. Logographic scripts (like Chinese) are sometimes likened to drawings or '''gestalts''', potentially fostering a more holistic mode of processing, whereas alphabetic scripts (like English) break language into abstract parts, aligning with analytical processing. Several scholarly perspectives and findings illustrate this contrast:

* '''Gestalt Processing of Logographs:''' Chinese characters originated as pictographs and still retain a '''graphic, non-linear quality'''. Readers often must grasp the character’s overall configuration (the arrangement of strokes or sub-parts) to recognize it, integrating multiple parts at once. According to Shlain (1998), perceiving an image or a Chinese character involves taking in '''all parts simultaneously''' and synthesizing them into a whole – the brain processes the pattern “all-at-once” in a holistic fashion​&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=reality%2C%20images%20or%20objects%20are,time%20fashion&lt;/ref&gt;. By comparison, '''reading an alphabetic word''' is a more sequential act: letters are parsed in order, and their sequence (and phonemic assembly) determines the word. This leads to a stepwise, '''analytic''' processing strategy&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=reality%2C%20images%20or%20objects%20are,time%20fashion&lt;/ref&gt;. In Shlain’s terms, logographic reading is akin to viewing a picture (concrete, synthetic, spatial), whereas alphabetic reading is akin to decoding a code (abstract, analytic, linear)&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=letters%20of%20alphabetic%20orthographies%20do,time%20fashion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=manner%20Footnote%205%20,time%20fashion&lt;/ref&gt;, Empirical studies of character recognition support elements of this: skilled Chinese readers can often recognize a character by its overall shape or by a salient sub-component (radical), using parallel processing of visual features. Holistic processing of Chinese characters has been observed especially under conditions of uncertainty, where readers rely on configuring all parts together to identify the character&lt;ref&gt;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10559014/#:~:text=into%20consideration%20information%20from%20each,perception%2C%20there%20is%20weak%20holistic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10559014/#:~:text=provides%20evidence%20that%20in%20word%2Fcharacter,play%20in%20visual%20word%20processing&lt;/ref&gt;, In contrast, less skilled readers of Chinese (or learners) tend to adopt a more analytic strategy (identifying parts sequentially), similar to how alphabetic readers sound out a new word letter by letter&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/45387160#:~:text=Analytic%20Versus%20Holistic%20Recognition%20of,or%20holistic%20strategy%20in&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10559014/#:~:text=cars%20&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Analytic Thought and the “Alphabet Effect”:''' The act of alphabetic reading may reinforce analytical and abstract thinking. The alphabet requires breaking words into constituent sounds and recombining them, an exercise in categorical and '''logical structuring''' of information. Over time, this has been theorized to influence cognitive habits. Logan (2004) described an “'''alphabet effect''',” arguing that the use of alphabetic scripts encourages habits of mind such as classification, abstraction, and linear reasoning​&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=Logan%20,patterns%20between%20Westerners%20and%20Chinese&lt;/ref&gt;. He notes that alphabetic literacy trains individuals in deductive reasoning and sequential logic by virtue of assembling letters into words and words into sentences in a rule-based way&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=as%20evidenced%20by%20research%20on,the%20essence%20of%20the%20alphabet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=Logan%20,patterns%20between%20Westerners%20and%20Chinese&lt;/ref&gt;. These skills mirror the analytical thought patterns often associated with Western cultures (which predominantly use alphabetic writing): e.g. formal logic, categorical grouping, and individualist, detail-focused cognition&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=Chinese%20characters%20or%20other%20nonalphabetic,science%2C%20formal%20logic%2C%20individualism%2C%20and&lt;/ref&gt;. By contrast, some researchers propose that logographic literacy fosters a relatively '''more holistic worldview''' – focusing on relationships and concrete reality rather than abstract categories&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=or%20European%20mode%20of%20thought,If%20there%20is%20a%20truth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=understanding%20the%20difference%20in%20thought,resulting%20in%20analogy%2C%20induction%2C%20and&lt;/ref&gt;. Because Chinese characters directly represent morphemes (concepts) and often carry inherent meaning, Chinese readers may lean toward '''associative and analogical thinking''' (seeing connections between whole concepts) rather than breaking things down into abstract components. In Logan’s comparison, prolonged engagement with alphabetic vs. logographic writing might contribute to the development of “Western” analytical thought vs. “Eastern” holistic thought, respectively&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=Chinese%20characters%20or%20other%20nonalphabetic,science%2C%20formal%20logic%2C%20individualism%2C%20and&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=concrete%20and%20practical%20propensities%20for,a%20consequence%20of%20reading%20logographies&lt;/ref&gt; While this view is somewhat '''contentious''' and cultural cognition is influenced by many factors, it aligns with independent findings in cross-cultural psychology that East Asian learners (immersed in character-based scripts and context-rich languages) tend to attend more to context and relationships, whereas Western learners focus on objects and categories&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=is%20contentious%2C%20the%20insight%20is,alphabets%2C%20while%20Chinese%20tend%20to&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Holistic Attention vs. Part-Based Analysis:''' Experimental evidence on perception corroborates these tendencies. East Asian participants (many of whom read logographic scripts) are more likely to perceive scenes '''holistically''', remembering background details and relationships between elements, whereas Western participants (alphabetic readers) tend to focus on central objects and classify them by category​&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=Chinese%20characters%20or%20other%20nonalphabetic,science%2C%20formal%20logic%2C%20individualism%2C%20and&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=concrete%20and%20practical%20propensities%20for,a%20consequence%20of%20reading%20logographies&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of this difference has been attributed to educational emphases on rote visual memory and pattern recognition in character learning. Additionally, the cognitive strategy used in reading may generalize: a Chinese reader, who must discern meaning from an entire character (which might contain a semantic hint radical and a phonetic hint radical), gets used to '''synthesizing multiple cues''' at once. An English reader, assembling a word from letters, practices '''analytic assembly''' of parts into wholes. Neuroscientific studies even find that processing Chinese characters can recruit brain regions (like the right fusiform gyrus) similar to those used in holistic face recognition, highlighting the emphasis on configural processing, whereas processing English words stays more left-lateralized and segmental&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316271209_Rethinking_the_function_of_brain_regions_for_reading_Chinese_characters_in_a_meta-analysis_of_fMRI_studies#:~:text=Neuroimaging%20studies%20have%20proposed%20specific,summarized%20brain%20regions%20in%20previous&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-use-same-brain-regions-to-read-alphabetic-and-logographic-languages/#:~:text=There%20is%20evidence%20that%20for,that%20are%20engaged%20for%20writing&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, '''logographic writing systems''' engage the brain in ways that emphasize '''visual-spatial cognition, memory for holistic patterns, and simultaneous integration''' of information, which correlates with more holistic cognitive styles. '''Alphabetic systems''', on the other hand, emphasize '''phonological processing, sequential analysis, and abstraction from symbols''', aligning with more analytic cognitive styles. These differences manifest in brain activation patterns (frontal visuo-motor networks vs. temporoparietal phonemic networks), in cognitive skills developed (visual memory and spatial reasoning vs. phonemic awareness and sequential memory), and even in cultural thinking patterns (contextual/holistic vs. discrete/analytical reasoning)​&lt;ref&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15343334/#:~:text=controls%2C%20that%20functional%20disruption%20of,in%20verbal%20and%20spatial%20working&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=reality%2C%20images%20or%20objects%20are,time%20fashion&lt;/ref&gt;. It is important to note that both systems ultimately engage overlapping neural circuits for reading, and skilled readers of any script employ a mix of holistic and analytic strategies; however, the '''weighting''' of those strategies and neural resources is shifted by the demands of the writing system&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316271209_Rethinking_the_function_of_brain_regions_for_reading_Chinese_characters_in_a_meta-analysis_of_fMRI_studies#:~:text=Neuroimaging%20studies%20have%20proposed%20specific,summarized%20brain%20regions%20in%20previous&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55152-0_1#:~:text=Logan%20,patterns%20between%20Westerners%20and%20Chinese&lt;/ref&gt;.

= The Evolving Concept of “God” Across Cultures =
Understanding how different cultures conceive of “god” requires examining both the '''linguistic roots''' of the term and the '''conceptual shifts''' over time. This report compares the Indo-European and Japanese developments in detail, then surveys Chinese, Uralic, Semitic, and Egyptian terms for deity. We will see recurring themes – such as sky gods, ancestor spirits, and cosmic order – that emerge as human societies evolved.

== Indo-European Origins of “God” ==
In Indo-European languages, several distinct root words for “god” emerged in antiquity. The four most commonly cited Proto-Indo-European (PIE) roots reflect different aspects of divinity:

* '''Sky/Light (''deiwos'') – the “Shining Sky” gods
* '''Ritual/Spiritual (*dʰeh₁- / ''dhes-'') – the “Sacred/Consecrated” gods
* '''Invocation/Sacrifice (*ǵhau- / ''gheu-'') – the gods as recipients of libation or invocation
* '''Dispensing Fortune (''bʰag'') – the gods as givers of wealth or fate

=== *Dyēus: Sky and Light ===
One ancient PIE word for god, ''deiwos'', literally meant “celestial” or “shining” – essentially the bright sky​&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus#:~:text=Deus%20,god%20of%20the%20%20200&lt;/ref&gt;. The word is related to the english word "day".
. This root gave rise to words for a '''sky deity''' across Indo-European cultures. For example:

* '''Latin ''deus''''' – meaning “god” in Classical Latin, from PIE ''deiwos''&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus#:~:text=Deus%20,god%20of%20the%20%20200&lt;/ref&gt;. It originally referred to a shining celestial power, cognate with the name of the chief Indo-European sky god (''Dyēus''). In Roman religion ''deus'' was a generic term for any deity&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus#:~:text=Deus%20,god%20of%20the%20%20200&lt;/ref&gt;. Only later, in Late Latin, did ''Deus'' become used primarily for the Christian God&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus#:~:text=In%20Classical%20Latin%20%2C%20,Irish%20and%20Scottish%20Gaelic%20Dia

&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sanskrit ''deva''''' – meaning a god or shining one, likewise from ''deiwos''. In Vedic tradition, ''Deva'' referred to the beneficent gods (like '''Dyaus''' the sky-father, '''Varuna''', '''Indra'''), in contrast to Asuras.
* '''Greek Zeus''' – the name of the sky father god (Zeus &lt; ''Dyēus''). Greek retained ''Zeus'' as a proper name for the chief god, but did not use it as a common noun for “god.” Instead, Greek developed a new word (theos; see below). ''Zeus'' is a true cognate of Latin ''Deus''&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus#:~:text=While%20Latin%20deus%20can%20be,dz%C3%A9us&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus#:~:text=%28,8&lt;/ref&gt;, both tracing back to the PIE “Sky-Father” (''Dyēus Ph₂tḗr'', “Father Sky”&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus#:~:text=,3&lt;/ref&gt;). Other descendants of this Sky-Father title include Vedic '''Dyauṣ Pitṛ́''', Latin '''Jupiter''' (''Iūpiter'' &lt; ''Djous patēr''), and Old Norse '''Týr'''&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus#:~:text=%28,8&lt;/ref&gt;

In early Indo-European belief, this sky god was often envisioned as a fatherly figure associated with daylight, the heavens, and cosmic order. The '''literal meaning''' of ''Dyēus'' as “daylight-sky”​&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-Iranian_paganism#:~:text=,382%20for%20further%20information&lt;/ref&gt;reflects how the deity was essentially the personified sky. Over time, words from this root (''deus'', ''deva'', etc.) became generic terms for any deity or the concept of the divine, especially as religions evolved from sky worship to more complex pantheons.

=== *Dʰeh₁- (Theos): Ritual and Sacred Space ===
The '''ancient Greek word ''theós'' (θεός)''', meaning “god,” has a different origin. Despite its surface similarity to ''deus'', the two are '''false cognates'''&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%8C%CF%82#:~:text=Despite%20its%20similarity%20in%20form,2&lt;/ref&gt;. ''Theos'' comes not from the sky-god root, but likely from PIE ''dʰeh₁-'' (“to put, to place”) with a suffix, forming ''dʰéh₁-s-''&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%8C%CF%82#:~:text=From%20Proto,%E2%80%9Cfestive%E2%80%9D&lt;/ref&gt;. This root carried a sense of '''“doing or placing (in a sacred manner)”''', and it underlies words related to ritual and festivals. Cognates of Greek ''theos'' include Latin ''fēriae'' “holidays” and ''fānum'' “temple,” as well as Latin ''festus'' “festive”&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%8C%CF%82#:~:text=From%20Proto,%E2%80%9Cfestive%E2%80%9D&lt;/ref&gt;. This suggests that ''theos'' originally connoted '''“that which is worshipped or consecrated”''', essentially a being of ritual significance.

Greek religion replaced the old sky-word for god (Zeus) with ''theos'' as the generic term for deity, broadening the concept beyond the sky-father alone. Notably, ''theos'' was often used in plural (''theoi'', “the gods”). The term carried an implication of '''numinous power''' – for example, the Greek root appears in words like ''enthousiasmos'' (“being possessed/inspired by a god”)​&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.oup.com/2009/11/good-god-and-etymology/#:~:text=gods%20,gydig%E2%80%94a&lt;/ref&gt;. This highlights how gods were seen as powerful forces that could inhabit or inspire individuals (sometimes causing ecstasy or even madness, as with the root of English ''enthusiastic''&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.oup.com/2009/11/good-god-and-etymology/#:~:text=gods%20,gydig%E2%80%94a&lt;/ref&gt;).

In summary, the PIE *dhes- line (Greek ''theos'') reflects a conceptualization of gods '''not primarily as sky beings, but as powers encountered in worship and sacred places'''. The enduring use of ''theos'' (and its derivatives like ''theology'', ''atheism'', etc.) in Western languages underscores the legacy of this concept of deity as ''“the object of devotion or festival.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.etymonline.com/word/festival#:~:text=neuter%20plural%20of%20festus%20,forming%20words%20for%20religious%20concepts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.etymonline.com/word/festival#:~:text=It%20might%20also%20be%20the,temple&lt;/ref&gt;​

=== Germanic *Gud: Invocation and Sacrifice ===
The Germanic languages’ word for god (Old English ''god'', Old Norse ''guð'', Gothic ''gudja'', etc.) has a debated etymology. Early Germanic paganism was polytheistic, and tellingly, '''only a plural form existed originally''' – there was no singular “God” until later religious changes​&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.oup.com/2009/11/good-god-and-etymology/#:~:text=along%20with%20witches%2C%20giants%2C%20revenants%2C,However&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.oup.com/2009/11/good-god-and-etymology/#:~:text=Germanic%20languages%3B%20only%20the%20plural,a%20technical%20term%20for%20a&lt;/ref&gt;. The plural ''gods'' (Proto-Germanic ''guðániz'') was neuter in gender, used for a broad class of supernatural beings&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.oup.com/2009/11/good-god-and-etymology/#:~:text=along%20with%20witches%2C%20giants%2C%20revenants%2C,However&lt;/ref&gt;
.
Etymologists have proposed two main PIE roots for ''god'' (Germanic ''ǥuđán''):

* *'''ǵhau-''' “to call, invoke”: one theory links ''god'' to a Sanskrit term for invocation (such as '''huta''' “invoked [one]”)​&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.oup.com/2009/11/good-god-and-etymology/#:~:text=attempts%20to%20find%20an%20Indo,invocation%20also%20has%20learned%20supporters&lt;/ref&gt;. On this view, ''god'' would mean ''“the one who is invoked (in prayer).”''
* *'''gheu-''' “to pour (a libation)”: the more widely accepted theory today is that ''god'' comes from the idea of pouring a sacrifice​&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.oup.com/2009/11/good-god-and-etymology/#:~:text=attempts%20to%20find%20an%20Indo,invocation%20also%20has%20learned%20supporters&lt;/ref&gt;. In many Indo-European rituals, offerings were poured out to the gods. Thus ''god'' could mean ''“the one to whom sacrifices are poured,”'' essentially ''“the libation-worthy being.”'' Modern scholars favor this derivation, interpreting “to pour” in the context of sacrificial rites&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.oup.com/2009/11/good-god-and-etymology/#:~:text=attempts%20to%20find%20an%20Indo,invocation%20also%20has%20learned%20supporters&lt;/ref&gt;

Both theories reflect the act of '''worship''' – calling upon or offering to a deity. In either case, the Germanic concept of ''god'' is tied to '''human interaction with the divine''' (invocation or sacrifice) rather than a description of the deity’s form (unlike “sky” or “shining” in other roots).

It’s worth noting that some scholars have even speculated ''god'' might not derive from any Indo-European root at all but from a pre-Germanic substrate language​&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.oup.com/2009/11/good-god-and-etymology/#:~:text=other%20modern%20Indo,Any%20%E2%80%9Cthick%E2%80%9D%20dictionary%20will&lt;/ref&gt;. However, lacking evidence of such a source, the invocation/pouring origin remains the standard explanation. After the conversion of Germanic peoples to Christianity, ''God'' with a capital G became the singular, masculine term for the one supreme deity. This was essentially a repurposing of the old plural word: ''“the singular was abstracted from the plural, and the neuter yielded to the masculine”'' for the Christian context&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.oup.com/2009/11/good-god-and-etymology/#:~:text=search%20for%20a%20better%20solution,with%20a%20primitive%20sky%20god&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Conceptual development:''' In pagan times, Germanic ''gods'' were a multitude of local spirits and deities (making people “giddy” or possessed, as Old English ''gydig'' implies​&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.oup.com/2009/11/good-god-and-etymology/#:~:text=gods%20,gydig%E2%80%94a&lt;/ref&gt;). With Christianization, ''God'' came to signify an '''all-good, singular Creator''', quite a shift from the earlier fearsome or mischievous spirits. (Importantly, despite the similarity in English, ''god'' is '''not''' related to ''good''&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.oup.com/2009/11/good-god-and-etymology/#:~:text=With%20the%20advent%20of%20Christianity%2C,Some&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.oup.com/2009/11/good-god-and-etymology/#:~:text=of%20our%20word%E2%80%99s%20Indo,bright%20sky%3B%20here%20we%20are&lt;/ref&gt;; folk etymology had linked them, but historical linguistics shows ''good'' has a different origin entirely.)

=== Slavic *Bogŭ: Dispenser of Fortune ===
Slavic languages use a root ''bogŭ'' (Old Church Slavonic ''bogŭ'', Russian ''Bog'', Polish ''Bóg'', etc.) for “god.” This word is '''etymologically linked to the idea of fortune, wealth, or apportionment'''. It is generally accepted that Slavic ''bog'' was borrowed from Indo-Iranian (likely Scythian or Sarmatian) ''bhaga'', a word meaning ''“distributor”'' or ''“lord of shares/fortune”''&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-Iranian_paganism#:~:text=,Name%20of&lt;/ref&gt;. In the Vedic Sanskrit context, '''Bhaga''' is indeed a deity who grants wealth and prosperity, and the Sanskrit noun ''bhaga'' meant “portion” or “lot” (hence fortune)&lt;ref&gt;https://aratta.wordpress.com/2014/11/22/the-etymology-of-bagh/#:~:text=Bhagavan%20literally%20means%20%E2%80%9Cpossessing%20fortune%2C,to%20Slavic%20bog%20%E2%80%9Cgod&lt;/ref&gt;.

Evidence of this origin is that Slavic ''bogŭ'' is cognate with words for wealth: e.g. Russian ''bogat'' (“rich”) and Sanskrit '''Bhagavān''' (an epithet of God meaning “possessor of fortune”) share the same root​&lt;ref&gt;https://kids.kiddle.co/Bhagavan#:~:text=...%20bhaga%2C%20meaning%20,Turkish%20bey%2C%20and&lt;/ref&gt;. A scholarly summary notes: ''“Slavic bog (‘god’) and bogatyj (‘rich’) are generally seen as loanwords from Iranian,”'' linked to a deity distributing prosperity&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-Iranian_paganism#:~:text=%5D,cf&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Conceptually''', the Slavic ''bog'' suggests a god as a '''benefactor or patron''' – one who gives wealth, good luck, or blessings. In pre-Christian Slavic religion, ''Bog'' may not have been the name of a specific god but rather a general term (possibly influenced by the reverence of a “Lord” of plenty). When Slavic peoples converted to Christianity, ''Bog'' straightforwardly became the term for the one God, now viewed as the source of all blessings. The old meaning survives in subtle ways: for instance, to say “thank you” in Russian (''spasibo'') originally meant “[may] God save [you]” and Polish ''Bóg'' remains the word for the Christian God. The core idea of '''God as provider''' underlies this term’s evolution, from pagan fortune-bestower to the almighty Providence in Christian thought.

=== Summary of Indo-European Developments ===
Across the Indo-European family, we see that '''different facets of divinity''' were emphasized in different branches:

* The '''Sky-Father and shining celestial''' aspect (''dyeus'') gave words like ''deus, deva'', emphasizing glory and heaven. This often correlates with fatherly or ruler-of-sky roles in myth (Zeus, Jupiter, Dyaus).
* The '''Sacred rite''' aspect (''dhes'') gave Greek ''theos'', framing gods as those invested with sanctity, tied to temples and festivals – gods defined by worship and awe rather than by location in the sky.
* The '''Invocation/Sacrifice''' aspect (''ghu-'') gave Germanic ''god'', defining gods by human action toward them (calling, offering). This highlights early Germanic gods as beings of appeasement and interaction.
* The '''Fortune/Lord''' aspect (''bhag'') gave Slavic ''bog'', defining god as a generous master of fate – reflective of a social structure where the deity is like a feudal lord dispensing bounty (and where wealth itself was seen as divine favor).

Despite these varied origins, as Indo-European cultures moved into the Common Era (and especially under the influence of Christianity), many of these terms converged in meaning. Latin ''Deus'', Greek ''Theos'', Germanic ''God'', and Slavic ''Bog'' all came to be used to denote the one Judaeo-Christian God by the Middle Ages. Yet the '''older, plural, and context-specific senses''' often persisted in mythology, language, and folk culture. For example, English still uses “gods” in a mythological or figurative sense, and words like “deity” (from Latin ''deus'') or “divine” (''dīvus'', from ''deiwos'') carry the original PIE sense of “shining/exalted.” Meanwhile, “enthuse/enthusiastic” carry the legacy of Greek ''theos'' (to be filled with a god’s spirit), and “to bless” in Slavic languages (Russian ''blagoslovit’'', “speak a good [word]”) echoes the connection between goodness and the favor of ''Bog''. These echoes remind us that the concept of “god” in Indo-European traditions was '''multifaceted from the start''' – encompassing the vault of heaven, the sacred rites, the act of worship, and the blessings of fortune.

== Japanese Conceptions of “Kami” ==
In contrast to Indo-European sky fathers and thunder gods, the '''Japanese concept of “god” (神, ''kami'')''' developed in an animistic and Shintō context that is quite distinct. The Japanese term ''kami'' does '''not''' neatly translate to the Western notion of a single omnipotent God. Instead, ''kami'' refers broadly to '''spirits or deities, a myriad of invisible forces or beings that inspire awe'''.

=== Etymology and Meaning of ''Kami'' ===
The word ''kami'' in Japanese is written with the character 神 (which was borrowed from Chinese ''shén'', “spirit/god”). In the indigenous Japanese reading, ''kami'' can be understood as '''“divine spirit”''' in the widest sense. Historical linguists have long debated the origin of the word. A popular folk etymology ties ''kami'' to the word ''kami'' (上) meaning “above” or “high up.” In the 14th century, scholars like Inbe no Masamichi noted that ''kami'' (deity) is homonymous with ''kami'' (above) and reasoned that '''“kami refers to what is above”''', since the gods dwell in the High Plain of Heaven in mythology​&lt;ref&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=9958#:~:text=South%20courts%20%28ca.%201333,are%20said%20to%20be%20kami&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=9958#:~:text=meaning%20,said%20to%20be%20%2013&lt;/ref&gt;. This idea – ''“kami = that which is above (superior)”'' – gained wide currency by the Edo period&lt;ref&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=9958#:~:text=The%20claim%20that%20,In%20contrast&lt;/ref&gt;.

Modern scholarship, however, suggests this is a coincidence of homophones. The characters for “above” (上) and “god” (神) are read the same, but likely have '''different etymological origins'''&lt;ref&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=9958#:~:text=The%20claim%20that%20,In%20contrast&lt;/ref&gt;. Motoori Norinaga, an 18th-century Shintō scholar, famously argued that trying to derive the meaning of ''kami'' from its phonetic components was misguided&lt;ref&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=9958#:~:text=led%20to%20the%20understanding%20that,the%20Japanese%20understanding%20of%20kami&lt;/ref&gt;. He asserted that only by observing usage in texts can one grasp what ''kami'' truly means. Norinaga’s definition, now classic, is that:&lt;blockquote&gt;'''“In general, ''kami'' refers first to the myriad ''kami'' of heaven and earth we see in the ancient classics, and the spirits (''mitama'') enshrined in shrines dedicated to them. Further, it refers to all awe-inspiring things — not only the noble, good, or virtuous, but also anything evil or strange that arouses awe — are called ''kami''.”'''&lt;ref&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=9958#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20kami%20%20refers,awe%2C%20are%20also%20called%20kami&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words, ''kami'' in Japanese are '''any entities, phenomena, or beings that possess extraordinary power and inspire awe, reverence, or fear'''&lt;ref&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=9958#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20kami%20%20refers,awe%2C%20are%20also%20called%20kami&lt;/ref&gt;. This could be a great deity like Amaterasu (the sun goddess) or a tiny spirit of a particular tree or rock. It includes natural forces (wind, thunder), natural objects (mountains, rivers), ancestral spirits of clan leaders, and even living people of remarkable charisma or danger.

Thus, unlike the more specific Indo-European terms, Japanese ''kami'' is a '''fluid and inclusive term'''. Everything from a benign harvest deity to a vengeful ghost might be ''kami'' if it has that ineffable quality of ''takusu'' (awe). Notably, ''kami'' can be plural or singular without change (Japanese has no plural ending for it) – often people speak of ''yaoyorozu no kami'', “the eight million kami,” to mean countless deities/spirits.

=== Historical Development of the ''Kami'' Concept ===
Japan’s earliest written records, the ''Kojiki'' (712 CE) and ''Nihon Shoki'' (720 CE), already contain a rich tapestry of ''kami''. These texts recount how the islands of Japan and all their elemental features were created by the primordial kami Izanagi and Izanami, and how a multitude of kami (gods of wind, sea, fire, fields, etc., as well as ancestral deities of each clan) populated the world. The sun goddess '''Amaterasu Ōmikami''' is a central ''kami'', ancestress of the imperial line. The very multiplicity of these tales shows that ''kami'' did not refer to a single supreme being but to '''an ever-expanding collection of deities and spirits''' connected to natural and social phenomena.

Over time, the concept of ''kami'' in Shintō religion maintained this broad inclusiveness. When Buddhism arrived in Japan (6th century CE), rather than displacing ''kami'', it syncretized with them: Buddhas and bodhisattvas were seen as another kind of ''kami'' or conversely ''kami'' were seen as local manifestations of Buddhas (the theory of ''honji suijaku''). The term ''kami'' thus extended to even include some foreign deities interpreted through a Japanese lens.

From the '''linguistic perspective''', ''kami'' remained the native word for any deity or numinous entity. It had to stretch to cover the monotheistic concept when Christianity was later introduced. For example, 16th-century Christian missionaries in Japan (like Francis Xavier) used “Deus” (from Latin/Portuguese) for God; but eventually the Japanese language settled on ''kami'' (often with the honorific ''-sama'') to translate the Christian God as well. Even today, in colloquial Japanese, ''kamI-sama'' can mean the singular God in Christian or Islamic contexts, while ''kami'' by itself might mean “a god/deity” or “the gods” generally.

'''Importantly, the Japanese idea of ''kami'' differs from Indo-European “god” concepts in a few key ways:'''

* ''Kami'' are often '''localized''' and '''plural'''. Each shrine has its own ''saijin'' (enshrined deity), and nature is full of ''kami''. There isn’t a strict hierarchy with one creator god at the top (though the emperor was traditionally said to descend from the top ''kami'', Amaterasu). In contrast, Indo-European pantheons often gravitated toward a chief sky god or a single creator figure over time. Shintō cosmology, however, is less about an omnipotent creator and more about the interplay of many forces.
* ''Kami'' include '''ancestral spirits''' to a notable degree. While ancestor worship exists in many cultures, in Japan the boundary between ancestor and deity is thin – e.g., legendary heroes or clan founders become enshrined as ''kami''. (The Emperor himself was considered a living ''kami'' historically.) This is somewhat akin to the Roman practice of deifying emperors (''divus'')​&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus#:~:text=In%20Classical%20Latin%20%2C%20,and%20by&lt;/ref&gt;, but in Japan it was broader and tied to indigenous beliefs about the afterlife and reverence for predecessors.
* Morality and goodness are not prerequisites to be a ''kami''. As Norinaga noted, even evil or fearful beings (if powerful enough to awe) are ''kami''&lt;ref&gt;https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=9958#:~:text=we%20see%20in%20the%20ancient,awe%2C%20are%20also%20called%20kami&lt;/ref&gt;. This concept hearkens back to a time when ''kami'' were essentially '''wondrous or fearsome manifestations of nature and existence''', not exclusively moral governors or beneficent fathers. Indo-European sky gods, by contrast, often took on roles as '''lawgivers or moral overseers''' (e.g. Zeus with justice, Varuna with cosmic order). Shintō ''kami'' primarily maintain the harmony of nature and community (through rituals) but did not traditionally dictate ethical codes – that aspect in Japan was more influenced by Confucian and Buddhist thought.

In summary, ''kami'' developed as a concept alongside Japan’s unique religious culture. It retained an '''animistic pluralism''' – the world is alive with countless spirits – and did not crystallize into a single all-powerful deity. This fundamental difference is often highlighted by scholars:&lt;blockquote&gt;'''“‘God’ as represented in the world of Abrahamic religions – a single being, creator of the world, transcendent – does not exist in Shintō. As an animist and polytheist religion, Shintō speaks rather of divine beings in many forms.”'''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.japan-experience.com/plan-your-trip/to-know/understanding-japan/god-in-japanese#:~:text=,notion%20in%20Japanese&lt;/ref&gt;​&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, any direct comparison between ''kami'' and, say, ''deus'' or ''theos'' must be made with caution. Linguistically, ''kami'' stands on its own, not known to be related to any other language’s word for god. Conceptually, it reminds us of an early stage in religious thought where '''the divine is everywhere around us''' – in the high mountains, the stormy seas, the ancestors’ spirits – an idea that, while present in ancient Indo-European paganism, was later overshadowed by more centralized deity concepts in the West.</text>

Author: Immanuelle Leonhart

Purpose

Polytheism has existed throughout all cultures since the dawn of time. It is in human nature to recognize the fundamental plurality of the divine which cannot be reduced into one. From the earliest cave paintings to the grand monuments of ancient civilizations, people have honored millions of gods, and there are millions more yet to be found.

We are not here to promote polytheism. Polytheism does not need promotion. It is the default of humanity. What we are here to do is to bring polytheism back into public life. Be it ancient gods, new gods, or gods people do not realize are gods, all gods deserve worship.

In authoritarian hubris, empires sought to deny this fact and ban the worship of most or all gods. Yet the people never truly stopped believing. They kept their faiths, and even found new gods underground. And their faiths, our faiths are growing as we realize we are not alone.

For this reason, we—the Polytheist Association—operate on an ecumenical polytheism that treats all gods with respect. The purpose of this organization is not to promote any one belief system but to build a platform allowing existing polytheisms to retake their rightful place in public life.

Organizational structure

We will establish a network of local shrines and regional temples, each holding its own autonomy while contributing to a shared, collaborative structure. A shrine will be a small facility—potentially beginning as a single household altar or a modest public site—dedicated to one god or a closely related group of gods. Every shrine will be overseen by a priest who documents its sacred lineage, rituals, and relics. Because many contemporary polytheistic practices have remained hidden or private, we recognize homes as entirely valid starting points for shrines, with the longer-term goal of returning open worship to public spaces.

Beyond these local shrines, we will create regional temples that serve as central hubs uniting and supporting multiple shrines within a given area. These temples will function much like community centers, hosting larger festivals, providing training for new priests, and safeguarding sacred objects if a smaller shrine must close. Each temple will also enshrine the gods honored throughout its region, ensuring every deity has a public place of reverence. This layered, decentralized structure will promote local autonomy—allowing practitioners to honor their gods in ways most meaningful to them—while fostering collective collaboration through shared resources, community-building, and the exchange of knowledge.

Establishing a shrine

If you have a personal practice and want to invite others into a shared, public expression of devotion, founding a shrine will be your next step. '''Shrines''' are the foundation of the Polytheist Association—not individual believers—because our goal is to cultivate living traditions and honor the gods, rather than claim ownership of human minds or private beliefs.

If you carry an interesting history of practice, or if your path reflects a unique syncretism, we encourage you to '''document''' it and create a shrine that brings your devotion into the public sphere.

'''Basic Requirements for a Shrine''':

# '''Designated Space''' – You will select a specific location for your shrine, which may begin as a dedicated area in your home.
# '''Relic or Sacred Object''' – You will identify a tangible focal point that houses or represents the deity (or deities) you wish to honor.
# '''Open Access (Upon Request)''' – While full public hours may not be feasible initially, you will ensure there is a way for community members or visitors to request entry.
# '''Annual Festival''' – You will designate at least one day per year for a festival celebrating the shrine’s deity, inviting the local community to gather and participate.
# '''Lineage Documentation''' – You will record any relevant background of your deity or practice, including where the relic came from and how you came to honor this particular god or gods.
# '''Pilgrim’s Mark''' – You will provide a physical calligraphic mark to be written in the pilgrimage diaries of visitors. This will help bring in revenue and encourage people to go on pilgrimages to many shrines in a local area.
# '''Coordination with the local temple''' – You must coordinate with the local temple. This will be covered more in the upcoming Temples section.

By meeting these essential points, you will help weave your shrine into the broader '''network''' of polytheistic worship. In time, should you or your community outgrow the home-based setup, your shrine may evolve into a more established public venue, strengthening both your local circle of practitioners and our collective movement for public polytheism.

You are encouraged to monetize the shrine. Incorporate it as a nonprofit and make it self sustaining. Because this is a necessary part to help bring polytheism into public life rather than remaining as small personal practice. 

== Relics ==
Relics are the tangible focal points through which the presence of a deity is acknowledged and made accessible. They may be naturally occurring objects (like a revered stone or sacred tree) or crafted items (such as statues, mirrors, or tokens). In some cases, even a living being—human or animal—can serve as a relic if it embodies divine power or lineage. Whichever form they take, relics provide a concrete anchor for devotion, bridging the intangible presence of a god with the material world. This not only helps worshipers focus their reverence but also preserves a sense of continuity; when you record the origin and history of a relic, you link today’s practice to both past traditions and future generations.

Here are the four types of relics
----

=== 1. Immovable Natural Object ===
These relics are part of the natural environment—sacred landmarks such as mountains, trees, or rock formations. By virtue of their sheer presence and history, they have come to embody a deity, acting as a profound spiritual anchor in the landscape.

* '''Sacred Mountains''' (e.g., Mount Fuji)
* '''Sacred Rocks''' (e.g., Uluru/Ayers Rock, Meoto Iwa, Acasta Gneiss)
* '''Ancient Trees''' (e.g., Methuselah bristlecone pine, Pando)
* '''Rivers or Lakes''' (e.g., Mississippi River)
* '''Burial Mounds''' (e.g., Kofun in Japan)
* '''Celestial bodies''' (e.g., Praise the Sun)
* '''Buildings or Institutions''' (e.g., The New York Public Library, The Capitol building)

----

=== 2. Movable Object ===
These relics are portable, allowing them to be carried to new sites or enshrined indoors. Craftsmanship and consecration often play a key role, transforming everyday items into divinely charged objects.

* '''Statues/Idols''' (e.g., Honzon Buddha statues)
* '''Swords'''
* '''Mirrors'''
* '''Magatama (sacred jewels)'''
* '''Body parts or belongings of saints'''

----

=== 3. Living Vessel (Human) ===
In this form, the deity resides in a human being who serves as a conduit of divine presence. Often, these individuals belong to a lineage or undergo specific training or consecration.

* '''Priests/Clergy with Holy Spirit Transmission''' (e.g., Catholic or Mormon)
* '''Dharma Transmission''' (e.g., certain Buddhist lineages)
* '''Inspired Oracles''' (e.g., the Ōhōri of Suwa-taisha Kamisha)

----

=== 4. Sacred Animal ===
Some traditions revere living animals or plants as direct embodiments of a deity. Whether through mythic origin stories or ongoing ritual practices, these beings are cherished as integral, animated manifestations of the divine.

* '''Apis Bull''' (Memphis in ancient Egypt)
* '''Sacred Crocodiles''' (Crocodilopolis)
* '''Temple Rats''' (Karni Mata Temple)
* '''Sacred Cows''' (various regions in India)

Temples

A '''Temple''' is essentially a '''shrine in a local area''' that has been '''elected''' or recognized to serve a broader public and administrative role. While our ultimate aim is for these temples to occupy more visible, publicly accessible locations, they may begin in someone’s residence if necessary. Over time, as resources and community engagement grow, these temples can expand to meet the needs of the region.

'''Core Functions'''

# '''Pantheon Shrine'''
#* Within each temple, there will be a dedicated '''pantheon shrine''' that enshrines or '''preserves backup relics''' for the deities of its region—'''but only for movable objects'''.
#* This ensures that if a smaller shrine closes or relocates, the deity’s presence remains safeguarded until a new shrine can be established.
# '''Centralized Training'''
#* '''Every year, priests''' from local shrines will attend a '''training session''' at the temple, refining their skills in ritual procedure, recordkeeping, and other communal duties.
#* This helps maintain consistency and quality across all shrines in the region.
#* A Temple can help people set up their own shrines for their own traditions, or help someone “adopt” a shrine whose priest was unable to continue their duties
# '''Regional Administration'''
#* Because a temple is recognized as a regional hub, it coordinates '''larger festivals''' or multi-shrine events and facilitates communication among local priests.
#* By holding this position, the temple eases the administrative burden on individual shrine keepers.
# '''Elected Status'''
#* A temple’s status is not solely about size or grandeur; rather, '''local consensus''' or formal selection grants a particular shrine the responsibilities of a temple.
#* Although we encourage establishing temples in public, easy-to-access spaces, a home-based temple remains legitimate if it effectively serves its regional duties.

In this way, temples become indispensable '''community centers''', uniting local shrines, safeguarding movable relics, and providing structured training. They stand at the crossroads between '''private devotion''' and the broader '''public life''' of polytheism, ensuring continuity, collaboration, and ongoing communal growth.

Documentation and Preservation

Every shrine carries its own '''unique story''', reflecting the culture, history, and lineage of the gods it serves. In keeping with our commitment to celebrate and honor this diversity, we will create a '''centralized digital archive''' to preserve and share these stories with the world.

# '''Public Online Registry'''
#* We will develop a '''website''' cataloging each shrine’s background, its deity (or deities), and the lineage or origin of its relic.
#* All shrines will be listed here, including branch shrines, so visitors can easily trace lineages back to their sources.
# '''Interactive Tools and App'''
#* We intend to create a '''user-friendly app''' that allows travelers, pilgrims, or curious individuals to '''locate shrines''', request visits, and even donate directly if they wish.
#* The app will be '''optional''' and '''open-source''', ensuring that nobody is required to use it to participate in Ecumenical Polytheism.
# '''Periodic Publications'''
#* We plan to '''publish a comprehensive book''' on a regular schedule, compiling information on active shrines, their stories, and any significant developments.
#* This ensures a physical record remains available for posterity, even if digital systems fail or are inaccessible.
# '''Translation Efforts'''
#* As a central organization, we will '''translate key information''' about each shrine into the official languages of the Polytheist Association (English, Japanese, French, Spanish, and Chinese).
#* While we encourage shrines to share or translate any scriptures or extensive teachings they may have, we will focus primarily on '''basic shrine data'''—deity names, origin stories, and lineage details—to keep the process manageable.
# '''Library Partnerships'''
#* Regional temples or local libraries may '''host physical collections''' of any scriptures, texts, or artifacts that belong to individual shrines.
#* Where feasible, we will also work on '''translating''' essential materials so that interested practitioners and researchers worldwide can learn from these unique traditions.
#* We do not have scripture. But shrines and temples may have their own scriptures.

By '''preserving''' and '''documenting''' every shrine’s story, we will ensure the '''continuity''' of diverse polytheistic practices, allowing future generations to explore their heritage and embrace the divine multiplicity that has always been humanity’s birthright.

Conclusion

We stand at a turning point where centuries of overlooked or suppressed polytheistic traditions are returning to public life. The Polytheist Association’s '''ecumenical approach''' seeks not to amalgamate these diverse faiths, but to provide them with the '''space, support, and recognition''' they deserve. Through the '''establishment of local shrines and regional temples,''' the careful preservation of '''relics''' and '''lineages,''' and open platforms for '''documentation''' and '''education,''' we are forging a living tapestry of devotion—one that honors '''every''' god, whether ancient, newly emerged, or yet to be widely recognized.

We invite all those who share our vision to '''join us''': build or adopt a shrine, celebrate festivals that fill neighborhoods with song and community spirit, and preserve the stories that keep our gods alive. Working together, we will ensure that '''plurality of the divine''' thrives in the public sphere, carrying our collective traditions forward into a bright, expansive future.

      <text bytes="105982" sha1="idgy6m63qm2sfoj5vrehdw465dw5p55" xml:space="preserve">The term '''“closed practice”''' has gained prominence in recent years, especially within neo-pagan, witchcraft, and online spiritual communities. In broad terms, a closed practice refers to a '''religious or ritual practice that is restricted''' – typically to members of a particular culture, community, or lineage – and '''not freely open to everyone'''. As one pagan writer succinctly explains: ''“Closed practices are those that you can only be a part of if you were born into the community, or if you have been initiated into it.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://thecritograph.com/2021/04/07/mystic-magic-closed-practices/#:~:text=Closed%20practices%20are%20those%20that,have%20been%20initiated%20into%20it&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, an “open” practice is accessible to anyone, while a “closed” practice requires some form of '''insider status''', whether by birth, heritage, or formal initiation​.&lt;ref&gt;https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1303&amp;context=honors#:~:text=,initiated%20into%20a%20closed%20religion&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has become central in discussions of '''cultural appropriation''' and respect for boundaries in spirituality. It is especially emphasized in online spaces (Tumblr blogs, Discord groups, Reddit forums) where modern pagans and witches deliberate what practices outsiders should ''not'' partake in.

Importantly, the idea of closed practices is '''not an entirely new phenomenon'''. Many religions throughout history have drawn lines around who may participate in certain rituals or access certain knowledge. However, the ''language'' of “open vs. closed practice” – and the specific concerns about cultural theft or misuse – have emerged in particular force within '''20th–21st century discourse'''. This report examines the academic history and discussion of closed practices: from early critiques of “plastic shamans” in the 1970s–80s, through the term’s origin in neo-pagan communities, to contemporary online debates and scholarly analyses. We will also highlight well-documented examples of restricted rituals in world religions (such as Catholic sacraments, initiation rites, or lineage-based esoteric knowledge) to see how they compare to the modern label of a “closed practice.” Throughout, the focus will be on '''academic and anthropological perspectives''' – how scholars of religion, anthropology, and philosophy have articulated or critiqued the notion of closed practices – rather than on purely informal debate.

== Historical Origins: From “Plastic Shamans” to Cultural Protection ==
Issues of outsiders appropriating sacred traditions were already a point of contention by the late 20th century. In the 1970s and 1980s, as New Age spirituality and neo-shamanism grew in popularity, Native American communities began '''speaking out against the misuse of their ceremonies'''. Activists coined the term '''“plastic shaman”''' to denounce non-Native gurus and authors who profited from imitations of Indigenous rituals&lt;ref&gt;https://web.mnstate.edu/robertsb/380/plastic%20shamans%20and%20astroturf%20sun%20dances.pdf#:~:text=plastic%20medicine%20men%20for%20hire,Bake%20Shamans%2C%E2%80%9D%20as%20some%20Na%02tive&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.mnstate.edu/robertsb/380/plastic%20shamans%20and%20astroturf%20sun%20dances.pdf#:~:text=commented%20on%20the%20bitter%20irony,Age%20interest%20in%20Native%20American&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, anthropologist Lisa Aldred noted in 2000 that ''“Euro-Americans professing to be medicine people have profited from publications and workshops”'' selling purported Native wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.mnstate.edu/robertsb/380/plastic%20shamans%20and%20astroturf%20sun%20dances.pdf#:~:text=Commercial%20exploitation%20of%20Native%20American,New%20Agers%20persist%20in%20consuming&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1980s, Native activists were directly confronting these exploiters: the American Indian Movement (AIM) even disrupted “plastic medicine men” workshops and publicly '''condemned those who profited from Native ceremonies.'''&lt;ref&gt;https://web.mnstate.edu/robertsb/380/plastic%20shamans%20and%20astroturf%20sun%20dances.pdf#:~:text=by%20%E2%80%9Cplastics%E2%80%9D%20and%20their%20workshops,The%20document&lt;/ref&gt; A famous statement from a 1993 gathering of Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota leaders – ''“A Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality”'' – declared ''“war against all persons who persist in exploiting, abusing, and misrepresenting the sacred traditions and spiritual practices”'' of Indigenous peoples&lt;ref&gt;https://web.mnstate.edu/robertsb/380/plastic%20shamans%20and%20astroturf%20sun%20dances.pdf#:~:text=by%20%E2%80%9Cplastics%E2%80%9D%20and%20their%20workshops,The%20document&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=3&amp;psid=730&lt;/ref&gt;. This strong language underscored that certain rituals (e.g. the Lakota Sun Dance or sacred pipe ceremonies) were '''not meant for outsiders''', especially not for commercial gain.

Such activism laid an important foundation for the '''ethic of closed practices'''. The message was that Indigenous spiritual knowledge is ''not open-access'' and that unauthorized use by outsiders is a form of harm or '''colonial theft'''. Anthropologists and scholars took note of these developments. Aldred, for instance, described how New Age appropriation amounts to a ''“commercialization of Native American spirituality”'' and how Indigenous peoples’ objections were rooted in the feeling that their sacred traditions were being degraded and '''exploited by those with no real authority'''&lt;ref&gt;https://web.mnstate.edu/robertsb/380/plastic%20shamans%20and%20astroturf%20sun%20dances.pdf#:~:text=Commercial%20exploitation%20of%20Native%20American,New%20Agers%20persist%20in%20consuming&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.mnstate.edu/robertsb/380/plastic%20shamans%20and%20astroturf%20sun%20dances.pdf#:~:text=commented%20on%20the%20bitter%20irony,Age%20interest%20in%20Native%20American&lt;/ref&gt;. In effect, Native critics were asserting that these ceremonies are ''closed'' – to be conducted only by those within the culture or by persons explicitly sanctioned. This early discourse did not yet use the term “closed practice,” but it articulated the '''core principle''': ''not everything is free for outsiders to take''. As one commentator later summarized, ''“everything is not open property just because we wish it to be so… everything is not ours to take, everything is not ours to sell”.''&lt;ref&gt;https://wildhunt.org/2014/11/culture-and-community-appropriation-exchange-and-modern-paganism.html#:~:text=that%20reminds%20us%20that%20everything,treasures%20are%20taken%20from%20a&lt;/ref&gt;

These debates in the 1970s–90s predominantly involved '''Indigenous and New Age contexts''', but they influenced neo-pagan communities as well. Many neo-pagans in the 1960s–80s had freely borrowed from a variety of global traditions in forming new Witchcraft and Pagan practices. For example, modern Wicca – founded by Gerald Gardner mid-20th century – cobbled together elements from ceremonial magic, folk practices, Eastern philosophy, and even Indigenous lore&lt;ref&gt;https://thecritograph.com/2021/04/07/mystic-magic-closed-practices/#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20reason%20for,very%20convoluted%20over%20the%20years&lt;/ref&gt;. By the 1980s, prominent Pagan authors like Starhawk and others were incorporating Native American terms (such as “smudging” with sage) or aspects of Afro-Caribbean religions into eclectic Witchcraft manuals. At the time, this syncretism was often seen as positive and creative. However, as '''post-colonial awareness grew''', some pagans began to question whether ''borrowing could become stealing''. The late 1980s and early 90s saw pagan writers start to acknowledge cultural appropriation as a problem. For instance, at the 1993 Parliament of the World’s Religions, Indigenous representatives forcefully criticized New Age and Pagan appropriations of their rites. This created a ripple effect: '''respect for closed traditions''' slowly entered the ethics of Pagan circles. By the mid-1990s, certain practices (like the sweat lodge, vision quest, or use of specific sacred herbs) were increasingly understood by Pagans to be '''off-limits unless one had proper permission or training'''. In essence, the concept of “closed practice” was germinating – even if it wasn’t yet called that – through these early cultural appropriation debates.

A notable contrast between then and now is the relative lack of contemporary commercialization. 

== Emergence of the Term in Neo-Pagan Communities ==
Within neo-pagan and witchcraft communities, the explicit terminology of '''“closed” vs. “open” practices''' seems to have crystallized in the 2000s and 2010s. Scholars note that by the 2010s, discussions of cultural appropriation had become ''“a central topic in the witch and neopagan community”'', especially online&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317819957_Cultural_Appropriation_in_Contemporary_Neopaganism_and_Witchcraft#:~:text=This%20thesis%20examines%20the%20discourse,to%20examine%20how%20the%20discourse&lt;/ref&gt;. An important study by Kathryn Gottlieb (2017) traced how this discourse evolved on the blogging platform Tumblr, which in the 2010s hosted a vibrant “witchblr” subculture. Gottlieb explains that neo-pagans began distinguishing '''open religions''' (those ''“available to everyone who wishes to practice them”'') from '''closed religions''' (those in which ''“one must be born or initiated”'' to participate)&lt;ref&gt;https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1303&amp;context=honors#:~:text=,initiated%20into%20a%20closed%20religion&lt;/ref&gt;. In practice, community members were creating '''informal lists''' of which spiritual traditions or rituals were considered closed. A Reddit user’s explanation captures the emerging consensus: ''“A closed practice is any practice that requires some type of initiation to take part in. A well-known example would be Catholic communion – you must be baptized (initiated) to receive it.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/pagan/comments/pxd4dg/comment/heoec8l/&lt;/ref&gt; While people often cite indigenous and magical traditions, this user’s example shows they were also framing even Christian sacraments in terms of “closed” access. The vocabulary of ''closed/open practice'' thus provided a new, simple heuristic: '''open = free for all; closed = requires invitation, initiation, or cultural belonging'''.
Online neo-pagan forums in the 2010s frequently debated specific cases. For example, many agreed that '''Native American spiritual ceremonies, Afro-Caribbean religions like Vodou and Santería, and Romani (Gypsy) folk practices''' were closed practices not open to outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/pagan/comments/pxd4dg/which_pagan_practices_are_closed/#:~:text=Which%20pagan%20practices%20are%20closed%3F,Some%20people%20will&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial on decolonizing paganism gives typical reasoning: ''Burning '''white sage''' and calling it “smudging” is closed to anyone who is not part of the Indigenous community.''&lt;ref&gt;https://thecritograph.com/2021/04/07/mystic-magic-closed-practices/#:~:text=Indigenous%20peoples,and%20a%20few%20other%20herbs&lt;/ref&gt; The same author notes that '''Vodou''' and other African-based traditions are also closed: ''“Most of these practices are closed as well. To join Vodou, one must find a priest and commit to the practice. Like Kabbalah, it is not something that can just be [picked up casually]”''&lt;ref&gt;https://thecritograph.com/2021/04/07/mystic-magic-closed-practices/#:~:text=Besides%20Kabbalah%20and%20Indigenous%20practices%2C,something%20that%20can%20just%20be&lt;/ref&gt; Here we see two important factors that pagans consider: '''ancestry''' (being part of an indigenous community) and '''initiation under elders''' (finding a priest, being taught). If a person lacks those, the practice is deemed ''“not for you.”'' In line with this, many Tumblr posts admonished eclectic witches to '''avoid appropriating closed practices''' and to seek alternative, culturally appropriate substitutes. For instance, instead of smudging with white sage (a plant sacred to certain Native tribes), non-Native witches were encouraged to use other herbs for smoke cleansing, or simply refer to the act as generic '''“cleansing”''' rather than using the word “smudge”&lt;ref&gt;https://thecritograph.com/2021/04/07/mystic-magic-closed-practices/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20Gardner%20and%20other,and%20a%20few%20other%20herbs&lt;/ref&gt;. Terminology became a sensitive point: using the ''correct names'' and not claiming titles like “shaman” or “voodoo priest” without credentials was part of respecting closed traditions.

It’s noteworthy that '''neo-paganism itself has both open and closed dimensions'''. Some neopagan traditions are ''initiatory'' (for example, Gardnerian Wicca is famously '''closed to non-initiates''', with secret rituals and oath-bound lore). Others are more open and eclectic. This internal reality may have primed pagans to understand the closed/open distinction. As one occultist pointed out, ''“Gardnerian Wicca is a ‘closed’ practice – initiates only – … Buddhism was once initiates-only, as was early Christianity”''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/11h71nh/feel_like_i_will_never_meet_other_practitioners/#:~:text=Prototaxite&lt;/ref&gt;. In other words, exclusivity in spiritual practice has precedent. However, what is new is the ''moral valuation'' attached to it. In online pagan discourse, labeling something a '''closed practice often carries a strong prescriptive tone''': outsiders ''should not'' partake, lest they commit cultural appropriation. This goes beyond simply “secret versus public” rites; it ties into '''social justice''' and anti-colonial ethics. One Tumblr user described the dynamic pointedly: ''“If you are integrating cultural practices from natives who are '''not open to sharing them''' with outsiders… you are appropriating – that is why we are discussing this term.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://wildhunt.org/2014/11/culture-and-community-appropriation-exchange-and-modern-paganism.html#:~:text=November%2015%2C%202014%20at%205%3A01,pm%20said&lt;/ref&gt;. In short, neo-pagans on platforms like Tumblr, Reddit, and Discord came to see guarding closed practices as a way to '''honor marginalized cultures''' and prevent the “theft” of spiritual resources by those in the dominant culture&lt;ref&gt;https://wildhunt.org/2014/11/culture-and-community-appropriation-exchange-and-modern-paganism.html#:~:text=their%20part%2C%20it%20is%20about,our%20intentions%20are%20honorably%20to&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://animalarchaeology.com/2018/07/16/what-is-old-is-new-again-cultural-appropriation/#:~:text=However%2C%20this%20masks%20the%20negative,can%20recreate%20imperialistic%20power%20structures&lt;/ref&gt;.

Over the last decade, numerous '''online communities and resources sprung up to educate practitioners''' on this subject. Guides and blog posts enumerate which deities, herbs, rituals or symbols are off-limits unless you belong to the originating culture. For example, the Tumblr blog ''“hopeful spirits”'' regularly reminds readers that '''Gaelic polytheism is ''not''''' a closed practice – pushing back against a misconception that one must have Celtic blood to worship Irish gods. ''“Gaelic polytheism is not a closed practice. You do not need to be from Ireland, Scotland, or Man or have any ‘Celtic blood’ to worship the Gods, Ancestors, and Spirits,”'' one post states, adding that ''“Anyone who tells you different is misinformed at best or probably a racist at worst.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://ceallaighcreature.tumblr.com/#:~:text=%3E%20Semi,probably%20a%20racist%20at%20worst&lt;/ref&gt;. This example highlights an important nuance: the closed practice discourse itself is '''contested and policed within the community'''. Some worry that calling a practice “closed” can slide into ethnic essentialism (e.g. saying only people of certain ancestry can participate, which can sound like a “blood and soil” ideology). Thus, even as many neo-pagans embrace the closed/open framework, there are internal debates about '''what falls where'''. Which traditions are truly closed? Who has the authority to say so? These questions continue to be hashed out on forums and group chats. Indeed, some online groups have banned the topic altogether to avoid fights – on Reddit’s r/witchcraft, moderators discourage “gatekeeping” discussions and treat any publicly available information as fair game for learning&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/11h71nh/feel_like_i_will_never_meet_other_practitioners/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20%E2%80%A2%20Edited&lt;/ref&gt;. This underscores that “closed practice” is not a unanimously agreed doctrine, but rather a '''living conversation''' in the community.

== Examples of Closed Practices in Religious Traditions ==
To better grasp what “closed practice” means, it is useful to look at concrete examples of '''restricted ritual or spiritual access''' across various religions. Many mainstream religious traditions have long maintained certain ''boundaries'' around who may participate in what – though their logic may differ from the modern neo-pagan usage. These examples will illustrate how '''diverse the forms of restriction''' can be, and how they sometimes align with, or differ from, the contemporary label ''“closed practice.”''

* '''Catholic Sacraments (Closed Communion):''' In Christianity, the idea of ''“closed communion”'' is centuries old. The Catholic Church, for instance, reserves the Eucharist (Holy Communion) for baptized Catholics in good standing. Non-Christians (and even Christians of other denominations) are not ordinarily permitted to receive the Eucharist at a Catholic Mass​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.catholic.com/tract/who-can-receive-communion#:~:text=gateway%20to%20the%20other%20sacraments%2C,Christians%20cannot%20receive%20Communion&lt;/ref&gt;. As a Catholic explainer notes, ''“Non-Christians cannot receive Communion because they have not received baptism, the gateway to the other sacraments.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.catholic.com/tract/who-can-receive-communion#:~:text=Who%20Can%20Receive%20Holy%20Communion,Christians%20cannot%20receive%20Communion&lt;/ref&gt; This is a clear example of a '''functional restriction''' based on initiation – baptism is effectively an entry rite. Historically, the early Church was even more guarded: in antiquity, the unbaptized were literally ushered out of the church before the Eucharistic prayers began. The rationale here is theological (to protect the sanctity of the sacrament and ensure recipients understand its meaning) rather than stemming from cultural ownership. Anyone ''may'' become Catholic through conversion, and thereafter participate; thus the practice is closed in a '''membership sense''', but not ethnically. This shows a key difference: “closed” in the context of a church means ''“members only”'', whereas in neo-pagan cultural discourse, it often means ''“outsiders can never truly become insiders,”'' except perhaps by rare adoption or heritage.
* '''Jewish Traditions and Kabbalah:''' Some religions are ''ethnically'' inflected in their closed practices. Judaism does allow conversion, but it traditionally does not seek converts, and some esoteric aspects are discouraged for outsiders. For example, '''Kabbalah''', the mystical tradition in Judaism, was historically restricted to learned Jewish practitioners (often males over 40 who had mastered Torah and Talmud). In neo-pagan circles, one often hears that ''“Jewish witchcraft is closed; if you are not Jewish, you cannot use parts of Kabbalah.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://thecritograph.com/2021/04/07/mystic-magic-closed-practices/#:~:text=Closed%20practices%20are%20those%20that,have%20been%20initiated%20into%20it&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Jewish voices have objected to non-Jews casually appropriating Kabbalistic symbols or rituals. The pop-occult “Kabbalah Center” (with celebrity non-Jewish followers) drew criticism from rabbis for this reason. Here we see a case where '''lineage and religious identity blur''' – Kabbalah is closed because it is deeply embedded in the Jewish faith and Hebrew language. Without that context, one is missing the necessary initiation (in this case, being part of the covenant of Judaism). This example aligns with the modern closed-practice concept: it’s about '''cultural/religious ownership''' of a practice (Jews for Kabbalah, in this framing). Notably though, Judaism does permit conversion; a converted Jew would be as Jewish as any other and could partake of Kabbalah study in traditional settings. Thus, from an academic view, we might say Kabbalah is ''relatively'' closed – requiring entry into the community first. Although Judaism and Kabbalah raise additional issues that will be raised in their own section later.
* '''Initiation-Based Mystery Cults:''' Throughout history, many societies have had '''secret rites and mystery religions''' that only initiates could attend. A famous example is the '''Eleusinian Mysteries''' of ancient Greece. These were sacred rituals in honor of Demeter and Persephone, celebrated for nearly 2000 years, in which participants had to undergo an initiation and oath of secrecy. The rites and knowledge revealed at Eleusis were ''kept strictly secret'' from the uninitiated public.{{Citation needed}} . Initiates from all over the Greek world (including women, men, free and enslaved persons of any ethnicity) could participate, but ''only'' if they underwent the prescribed initiation – and they were sworn not to reveal the Mysteries on pain of death. In modern terms, Eleusis was clearly a '''closed practice''': one could not simply walk in and observe without being part of the initiated group, and its “membership” was defined by ritual initiation rather than by culture or lineage. Academically, such cults are often termed '''“mystery religions”''' or '''“esoteric societies.”''' They illustrate that long before the current debates, '''religious secrecy and restricted access''' were common. The purpose was often to safeguard sacred knowledge and enhance group bonds. Similarly, in the '''Freemasonry''' fraternity (originating in the 18th century but drawing on older secret society models), one must be initiated through degrees to learn the inner rituals. These forms of closed practice are based on '''initiation and oath''' as the gatekeeping mechanism – conceptually similar to how neo-pagans describe “must be initiated” for, say, Haitian Vodou or Wicca.
* '''Lineage and Secret Societies in Indigenous Contexts:''' Anthropological literature is rich with examples of '''closed ceremonial societies''' in Indigenous cultures worldwide. In parts of West and Central Africa, for instance, societies like the '''Poro and Sande''' (in Sierra Leone, Liberia, etc.) or the '''Ogboni''' (among the Yoruba of Nigeria) are closed fraternities with secret rites. Members undergo rigorous initiations, and there are often penalties – even death – for insiders who divulge secrets to outsiders​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ajol.info/index.php/jrhr/article/view/180262/169609#:~:text=match%20at%20L352%20Secret%20societies,not%20a%20common%20sight%20to&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ajol.info/index.php/jrhr/article/view/180262/169609#:~:text=Secret%20societies%20in%20Africa%20have,not%20a%20common%20sight%20to&lt;/ref&gt;. Knowledge in these societies is tiered: initiates learn progressively deeper secrets, and the uninitiated are not allowed to witness certain ceremonies at all. In many Australian Aboriginal communities, there are “men’s business” and “women’s business” rituals that are strictly segregated; only initiated men can see certain sacred objects or art, for example. Outsiders to the culture are generally ''never'' permitted access to these secret traditions, and even uninitiated community members may be excluded until undergoing the proper rites. Anthropologists have had to tread carefully – early ethnographers who published secret details earned lasting distrust. These indigenous secret-cult examples highlight a form of closed practice grounded in '''sacred secrecy and group identity'''. Unlike the neo-pagan discourse (which often centers on preventing ''cultural exploitation''), in these cases the concern is often '''cosmic or social order''' – i.e., that powerful ritual knowledge, if misused or revealed to the wrong people, could bring harm or lose its efficacy. Nonetheless, the net effect is similar: there are clear boundaries beyond which an outsider (or uninitiated person) ''must not cross''. The modern language of “closed practice” can certainly describe these scenarios.
* '''Initiatory African-Diaspora Religions:''' Religions like '''Haitian Vodou, Cuban Santería (Regla de Ocha), Candomblé, and Hoodoo/Rootwork''' often come up in current debates. These traditions are rooted in specific ethnic and historical experiences (e.g. Vodou in the Haitian context of former enslaved Africans and Catholic influence). They typically have '''formal initiation ceremonies (kanzo in Vodou, making Ocha in Santería, etc.)''' which induct a person into the priesthood or society of the religion. Without initiation, one might attend public ceremonies or be a client, but one is not a full practitioner. Importantly, these traditions ''do'' accept sincere outsiders in many lineages – there are white and non-African-descended priests of Vodou and Santería, for example, who were properly initiated. However, from the perspective of an outsider looking in (and certainly from the perspective of ''internet discourse''), Vodou and related faiths are considered '''closed practices'''. You cannot simply read a book and declare yourself a Vodou priest; you must go through the community’s own channels​.&lt;ref&gt;https://thecritograph.com/2021/04/07/mystic-magic-closed-practices/#:~:text=Besides%20Kabbalah%20and%20Indigenous%20practices%2C,something%20that%20can%20just%20be&lt;/ref&gt; Practically, this is an initiation-based restriction akin to the Eleusinian example, but it’s also bound up with '''cultural identity''' (since these faiths carry the heritage of marginalized peoples). Scholars of religion point out that such traditions manage a '''balance between openness and protection''': they often welcome ''genuine seekers'' who apprentice under a house and undergo the rites, but they strongly reject dilettantes or commercial exploiters. Indeed, the very term “'''Hoodoo'''” in African-American communities has an element of closed secrecy – for generations it was practiced quietly within black communities, and knowledge was passed down in families or mentor relationships, kept out of mainstream view. Today, one sees debates (especially on platforms like TikTok or Tumblr) about whether non-black practitioners can or should do Hoodoo; many black American practitioners assert it is a '''closed practice belonging to African-American heritage''', cautioning outsiders against cherry-picking spells or sacred songs from it.
* '''“Conversion-Restricted” Religions:''' Some entire religions are traditionally ''closed'' in the sense that they do not accept converts or make it exceedingly difficult. For example, the '''Parsi Zoroastrians''' (Indian Zoroastrians descended from Persian immigrants) historically do not admit new converts – one must be born into a Zoroastrian family to be recognized. Similarly, certain Hindu temples or sects have rules barring non-Hindus from entering sacred precincts (e.g. the Jagannath Temple in Puri, India prohibits non-Hindus from entry). These cases are about '''ethnic or hereditary criteria''' for participation. They complicate the neat open/closed binary: Is Hindu worship “closed” or “open”? Hinduism as a whole has no conversion sacrament and is broad, but specific lineages and temple communities may be closed to outsiders. Anthropologist Michael Lambek and others have noted that some cultures conceive religion as an inalienable inheritance – ''you can’t just adopt it at will''. This outlook resonates with the neo-pagan insistence that ''certain practices belong to a people'' and outsiders can’t just help themselves. However, it’s worth noting that many world religions have ''opened up over time'' – for instance, '''Buddhism''' in its early monastic form required joining the sangha (monastery) to fully practice, but today it is quite “open” globally with many non-Asian adherents (though even Buddhism retains esoteric initiations in Vajrayana/Tantric contexts).

In summary, examples across the world reveal ''multiple dimensions'' of why a practice might be closed: '''sacred secrecy, initiation status, ethnic lineage, doctrinal purity, or cultural survival'''. The modern label “closed practice” in online discourse tends to blur some of these distinctions, treating them all under one umbrella of “not for outsiders.” Scholars find this both useful and problematic – useful as a shorthand for talking about '''power and permission''' in spirituality, but potentially oversimplifying very different scenarios. The Catholic communion example, for instance, is often cited in pagan forums as a “closed practice”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/pagan/comments/pxd4dg/which_pagan_practices_are_closed/#:~:text=A%20closed%20practice%20is%20any,you&lt;/ref&gt;, which is true in one sense, though the Church’s reasoning has nothing to do with cultural appropriation. Likewise, someone might argue that if ''all'' practices requiring initiation are “closed,” then even things like Reiki (which has attunements) or certain forms of Yoga could be considered closed. Clearly, context matters.

== Contemporary Online Discourse and Community Dynamics ==
The rise of social media platforms dedicated to witchcraft and paganism (Tumblr’s #witchblr, various Discord servers, subreddits like r/witchcraft and r/pagan) has amplified the discussion of closed practices. These online communities have become '''key sites for both the promotion and the challenging of the concept'''. Ethnographic studies and firsthand accounts indicate that newcomers often learn about closed practices through community guidelines and veteran members. In interviews conducted on the role of online communities for witches, participants noted encountering '''strong moral norms''' against appropriation. Some experienced users took it upon themselves to correct or even scold those seen using closed practices in ignorance​&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-03441-z#:~:text=reinforcing%20cultural%20appropriation%20or%20stereotypical,the%20trends%20described%2C%20where%20different&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-03441-z#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D%20%28Ash&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, a new witch posting about burning sage might be met with comments explaining the Native context of smudging and suggesting alternative herbs. While this can be educational, researchers have observed it can also veer into '''policing and gatekeeping''' that ''“was generally perceived as off-putting, particularly for those who were new to witchcraft.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-03441-z#:~:text=reinforcing%20cultural%20appropriation%20or%20stereotypical,the%20trends%20described%2C%20where%20different&lt;/ref&gt;The zeal to enforce respect for closed practices sometimes turns into what one study participant described as ''“moral preaching”'' that could alienate newcomers&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-03441-z#:~:text=reinforcing%20cultural%20appropriation%20or%20stereotypical,the%20trends%20described%2C%20where%20different&lt;/ref&gt;. In a 2022 study of online witch identities (Frampton &amp; Grandison 2023), some interviewees reported witnessing “bullying of newly practicing witches” over issues like using the wrong terminology or inadvertently invoking a closed practice&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-03441-z#:~:text=reinforcing%20cultural%20appropriation%20or%20stereotypical,the%20trends%20described%2C%20where%20different&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-03441-z#:~:text=elements%20of%20practitioners%E2%80%99%20identities%20appeared,or%20create%20their%20own%20groups&lt;/ref&gt;. Moderators of groups often have to walk a fine line between '''allowing discussion''' of these issues and preventing flame wars.

There is also a generational or subcultural divide in attitudes. Broadly, the '''Tumblr-born discourse''' of closed practices has been championed by many younger or more socially progressive practitioners, whereas some older or more traditional occultists bristle at what they see as rigid rules. This tension is evident in online arguments. For instance, on Reddit’s r/occult, one user argued that ''“most ‘closed practice’ claims are just veiled racism”'' – an expression of frustration that the concept can become too tied to race and ancestry​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/11h71nh/feel_like_i_will_never_meet_other_practitioners/#:~:text=Prototaxite&lt;/ref&gt;. He pointed out that historically, religions spread through contact and that ''“clinging to long dead traditions”'' and keeping them closed might not be practical or necessary&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/11h71nh/feel_like_i_will_never_meet_other_practitioners/#:~:text=You%20won%27t,colonial%20traditions%20taken%20from%20westerners&lt;/ref&gt;. On the other hand, many practitioners of color and their allies emphasize that '''power imbalances''' in society make these boundaries necessary. A common refrain is that when a dominant-culture person takes on a minority’s sacred practice without permission, it ''perpetuates the colonial pattern'' of exploitation&lt;ref&gt;https://animalarchaeology.com/2018/07/16/what-is-old-is-new-again-cultural-appropriation/#:~:text=However%2C%20this%20masks%20the%20negative,can%20recreate%20imperialistic%20power%20structures&lt;/ref&gt;. In one blog, this is phrased as ''“an outsider... gains from their use of practices that are not rightfully theirs, which in effect can recreate imperialistic power structures”''&lt;ref&gt;https://animalarchaeology.com/2018/07/16/what-is-old-is-new-again-cultural-appropriation/#:~:text=However%2C%20this%20masks%20the%20negative,can%20recreate%20imperialistic%20power%20structures&lt;/ref&gt;. Online community ethos often leans toward protecting those who have historically been disempowered in spiritual conversations.

Interestingly, some platforms have institutionalized positions on the matter. As noted, '''Reddit’s r/witchcraft''' decided to consider the sharing of any information that is publicly available (in books or online) as “open,” effectively disallowing users from trying to gatekeep others based on closed practice arguments​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/11h71nh/feel_like_i_will_never_meet_other_practitioners/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20%E2%80%A2%20Edited&lt;/ref&gt;.

This policy was an attempt to reduce infighting. It suggests that while the majority acknowledges closed practices conceptually, ''enforcing'' that norm in a large, diverse online group can be contentious. Meanwhile, specialized groups – for example, a Discord server specifically for Afro-diasporic religions – may have strict rules reflecting closed status (e.g. only initiates can teach certain things, outsiders should ask permission to observe chats, etc.). Thus, online discourse is not monolithic; it is an evolving negotiation. Scholars following these trends sometimes liken it to earlier phenomena of '''internet “flame wars” and norm formation''', but with a new dimension of social justice language.

Despite the debates, the closed practice concept has definitely ''shaped behavior'' in these communities. Many well-intentioned eclectic practitioners now carefully '''vet their practices''': ''Is this symbol from a culture I have no connection to?'', ''Did I learn this chant from a closed tradition?'', ''Do I have the right to use this deity’s name or should I seek a teacher first?'' This self-scrutiny is a marked change from, say, the 1990s when a neo-pagan might cheerfully mix Navajo chant with Celtic rites without a second thought. One tangible outcome is the creation of '''alternative rituals and vocabularies''', as mentioned earlier. A neopagan might opt for a '''“land acknowledgment”''' to honor Native peoples rather than appropriating a smudging ritual; or use the term “'''smoke cleansing'''” instead of “smudging” and choose local herbs to burn​&lt;ref&gt;https://thecritograph.com/2021/04/07/mystic-magic-closed-practices/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20Gardner%20and%20other,and%20a%20few%20other%20herbs&lt;/ref&gt;. Another example is crafting new ceremonies inspired by indigenous ones but not copying them – e.g. doing a generic four-directions salute in a Wiccan circle, but ''not'' using the exact prayers of the Lakota Sun Dance. These adaptations are sometimes shared online as “'''culturally respectful alternatives'''.” Gottlieb’s research on Tumblr witches found that community members actively developed such alternatives and '''“neutralization techniques”''' – essentially justifications or modifications to avoid the stigma of appropriation&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317819957_Cultural_Appropriation_in_Contemporary_Neopaganism_and_Witchcraft#:~:text=This%20thesis%20examines%20the%20discourse,to%20examine%20how%20the%20discourse&lt;/ref&gt;. In her interviews, some pagans described feeling guilty when they discovered a practice they had been doing might be closed, and then taking steps to change their practice or seek proper permission.

== Scholarly Perspectives and Critiques ==
Academic engagement with the closed practice concept has grown in tandem with its spread in popular discourse. Scholars of contemporary religion, anthropology, and philosophy have approached the issue from several angles:

* '''Understanding the Discourse:''' Researchers have worked to document ''how and why'' the closed-practice idea took hold. Kathryn Gottlieb’s 2017 thesis (University of Maine) was an early scholarly work devoted to this, titled ''“Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft.”'' She examined '''Tumblr discussions''' and interviewed practitioners to understand the discourse’s impact​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317819957_Cultural_Appropriation_in_Contemporary_Neopaganism_and_Witchcraft#:~:text=This%20thesis%20examines%20the%20discourse,to%20examine%20how%20the%20discourse&lt;/ref&gt;. Her study situates the closed-practice debate in the broader history of modern witchcraft, noting that neopaganism’s eclectic roots were being re-evaluated through a lens of cultural sensitivity. She also noted the development of ''“alternative terminologies”'' (like saying ''“cleansing”'' instead of ''“smudging”'') as the community’s response to recognizing a practice as closed&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317819957_Cultural_Appropriation_in_Contemporary_Neopaganism_and_Witchcraft#:~:text=This%20thesis%20examines%20the%20discourse,to%20examine%20how%20the%20discourse&lt;/ref&gt;. This indicates a conscious shift in the community’s identity – an example of what anthropologists call '''reflexive self-regulation''': the community is modifying itself based on ethical reflections. Gottlieb’s work treats the topic seriously, validating that ''this is a significant conversation that tells us about the evolution of modern Pagan values.''
* '''Critical Theory and Power:''' Scholars like Sabina Magliocco (a folklorist/anthropologist) and Amy Hale have discussed appropriation and closed practices in terms of '''power dynamics and authenticity'''. An important point made in academic circles is that cultural appropriation is ''not equivalent to mere cultural exchange'' – it crucially involves '''exploitation and unequal power'''&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@amyhale93/on-paganism-fakelore-and-tired-conversations-about-authenticity-10ab0c9537d0#:~:text=make%20the%20practices%20illegitimate%20or,in%20respectful%20and%20healthy%20circumstances&lt;/ref&gt;. As anthropologist Amy Hale puts it, ''“Cultural appropriation is not the same as cultural borrowing. Appropriation involves exploitation and differentials in power relations.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@amyhale93/on-paganism-fakelore-and-tired-conversations-about-authenticity-10ab0c9537d0#:~:text=make%20the%20practices%20illegitimate%20or,in%20respectful%20and%20healthy%20circumstances&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, when a majority-culture person adopts a minority culture’s spiritual practice without permission, it’s qualitatively different from two cultures freely sharing with mutual respect. This theoretical framing supports why closed practices ''should'' be respected in many cases – to avoid reinforcing historic inequalities. Furthermore, some scholars tie this to the concept of '''cultural heritage rights'''. There is a growing recognition (even in international law, like UNESCO conventions and the U.N. Declaration on Indigenous Rights) that communities have a right to protect and control their intangible cultural heritage, including sacred rituals. The closed practice ethos can be seen as a grassroots reflection of that principle. It is a form of what some philosophers might call '''“cultural privacy”''' or '''“epistemic self-determination”''' – the idea that a culture can choose how and with whom its sacred knowledge is shared.
* '''Critiques of Essentialism:''' On the other hand, scholars have also critiqued the closed-practice discourse when it becomes too rigid or '''essentialist'''. Amy Hale, for example, while acknowledging the realities of appropriation, warns against an overly zealous focus on cultural purity. ''“Cultural artifacts survive and thrive through transmission and contact,”'' she notes, and it is acceptable for cultures to exchange in healthy ways​&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@amyhale93/on-paganism-fakelore-and-tired-conversations-about-authenticity-10ab0c9537d0#:~:text=situationally%20addressed,in%20respectful%20and%20healthy%20circumstances&lt;/ref&gt;. Hale argues that demanding perfect purity of lineage for every practice is historically untenable – ''“perfect unbroken transmission is nearly impossible to find with any cultural expression”''&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@amyhale93/on-paganism-fakelore-and-tired-conversations-about-authenticity-10ab0c9537d0#:~:text=Perfect%20unbroken%20transmission%20is%20nearly,a%20deep%20emotional%20core%20within&lt;/ref&gt;. She cautions that ''“focusing on cultural purity and origins leads to disappointment at best and Nazis at worst.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@amyhale93/on-paganism-fakelore-and-tired-conversations-about-authenticity-10ab0c9537d0#:~:text=Perfect%20unbroken%20transmission%20is%20nearly,a%20deep%20emotional%20core%20within&lt;/ref&gt;This provocative statement highlights the danger of a “bloodline-based” approach: it can slide into the same kind of exclusivist thinking that extremist ethnonationalists use. In scholarly terms, Hale and others critique what they call '''reification of culture''' – treating cultures as sealed, static entities. Modern anthropological consensus is that cultures are dynamic, and syncretism (the blending of practices) has been a constant in religious history. Therefore, a blanket interdiction on participating in another culture’s practice might ignore contexts where sharing is welcomed or where identities are mixed. Anthropologist Sabina Magliocco has similarly noted that '''too narrow a view of authenticity''' can be problematic. She observed that some neo-pagans and indigenous groups form alliances and share practices in good faith, complicating the simple open/closed binary&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@amyhale93/on-paganism-fakelore-and-tired-conversations-about-authenticity-10ab0c9537d0#:~:text=3,may%20be%20of%20interest%20here&lt;/ref&gt;. For instance, some Celtic Reconstructionist pagans have respectfully learned from living Celtic folk traditions – is that appropriation or just revival? The answer may depend on perspective.
* '''Contested Boundaries – Academic Analysis:''' A very recent scholarly contribution is a chapter by Apoorvaa Joshi and Ethel Brooks (2025) entitled ''“Whose Craft?: Contentions on Open and Closed Practice in Contemporary Witchcraft(s)”''. This appears in ''The Witch Studies Reader'' (Duke University Press, 2025) and explicitly tackles the debates around open vs. closed practices. The authors describe '''“contested boundaries”''' in the witchcraft community, noting that ''“one such boundary, and the focus of this chapter, is the discussion around ‘open’ and ‘closed’ practices.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/3469/chapter/10164502/Whose-Craft-Contentions-on-Open-and-Closed#:~:text=,around%20%E2%80%9Copen%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Cclosed%E2%80%9D%20prac&lt;/ref&gt;. While we only have a preview of their work, it’s clear that academic interest has recognized this as a '''hot-button issue that encapsulates deeper questions''': who “owns” spiritual knowledge? How do decolonial and feminist perspectives influence modern witchcraft? Preliminary information suggests Joshi and Brooks approach it from a '''critical decolonial feminist perspective''', examining how debates on closed practice intersect with issues of race, colonial history, and the self-definition of witches outside Eurocentric narratives&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317819957_Cultural_Appropriation_in_Contemporary_Neopaganism_and_Witchcraft#:~:text=that%20witches%20loom%20large%20in,in%20which%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20witch%E2%80%9D%20is&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317819957_Cultural_Appropriation_in_Contemporary_Neopaganism_and_Witchcraft#:~:text=colonial%2C%20patriarchal%20knowledge%20regimes%2C%20this,Quilty%2C%20Anna%20Rogel%2C%20Karen%20Schaller&lt;/ref&gt;. The very title “Whose Craft?” signals the core question of ownership and belonging. Scholars like them likely argue that the closed-practice discourse is part of a larger '''reckoning with colonialism in contemporary Paganism''' – an effort to “decenter Europe,” uplift suppressed indigenous voices, and challenge the free-for-all universalist approach that older occultism sometimes took&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317819957_Cultural_Appropriation_in_Contemporary_Neopaganism_and_Witchcraft#:~:text=that%20witches%20loom%20large%20in,in%20which%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20witch%E2%80%9D%20is&lt;/ref&gt;. At the same time, by calling them “contentions,” they acknowledge this is not settled; it’s an evolving negotiation of identity in modern witchcraft.
* '''Ethical and Philosophical Debates:''' Philosophers of religion and ethicists have also weighed in indirectly by discussing '''cultural appropriation ethics'''. One debate is how to balance ''respect for closed practices'' with the values of ''individual spiritual freedom''. Western liberal thought generally supports the idea that individuals can explore any religion. Yet, the closed practice idea posits that moral constraints exist on that freedom out of respect for communities. This is a tension between '''individualism and collective rights'''. Some philosophers argue that if an outsider approaches a tradition humbly, learns the language, even converts or is initiated properly, then morally there is no issue – the practice is no longer “stolen” but rather '''shared with consent'''. Others note that power imbalances complicate the possibility of genuine consent (e.g., an economically pressured shaman might “share” sacred rituals for money, but is that true consent or coerced by circumstances?). In sum, academic discussions probe questions like: ''Can spiritual knowledge be owned?'' ''Is restricting spiritual practices a form of necessary protection or a problematic gatekeeping?'' These remain open questions with thoughtful arguments on both sides.
* '''Lived Reality and Complexity:''' Ethnographers who study particular communities often find that the reality of how practices are shared or closed is quite nuanced. For example, an anthropologist studying Haitian Vodou might find that ''within Haiti'', Vodou priests are proud to initiate foreigners who show respect – hence from their perspective Vodou isn’t “closed” in a racial sense, though it ''is'' closed in that you must go through the proper initiation. Meanwhile, on the internet, one sees non-Haitians doing pseudo-Vodou spells without initiation – which ''is'' offensive to the community. Thus the issue is not that outsiders can ''never'' join, but that they must do so '''on the community’s terms'''. Scholars like Erin Taylor and Elizabeth Perez (who have studied Afro-Caribbean traditions) emphasize the importance of '''relationship and permission'''. A practice might be ''conditionally open'' – if you build a relationship with the culture, you may be welcomed – but it remains ''closed to casual appropriation''. This nuance sometimes gets lost in heated online exchanges. Anthropologist Sabina Magliocco has observed that in some cases neo-pagans have responsibly engaged with indigenous teachers and received permission to adapt certain practices, muddying any simplistic categorization of that practice as strictly “closed” or “open.”

In conclusion, the academic framing of closed practices tends to support the '''intent''' behind the concept – protecting vulnerable cultures from exploitation – while also urging a '''critical, nuanced approach'''. Scholars often encourage moving beyond slogans to ask: ''Who sets the boundaries? How do power and history play in?'' They also draw parallels to similar concepts in other domains, such as intellectual property rights, secrecy in ritual, and cultural revival movements. There is a recognition that the closed-practice discourse is ''part of a broader decolonization trend'' in spirituality. As one commentator noted, the effort to avoid appropriation forces modern Pagans to learn more about the '''“cultural &amp; historical context”''' of traditions, making them more educated and respectful practitioners overall​&lt;ref&gt;https://ceallaighcreature.tumblr.com/#:~:text=,to%20better%20understand%20the%20historical&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ceallaighcreature.tumblr.com/#:~:text=context%20of%20the%20spiritual%20traditions,Paganism%20is%20not%20an%20aesthetic&lt;/ref&gt;. This educational silver lining is something scholars praise – it pushes practitioners toward genuine intercultural understanding rather than shallow borrowing.

== Conclusion ==
The concept of “closed practices” in religion has evolved from a niche concern of indigenous activists into a wide-ranging discussion that engages neo-pagan communities, internet subcultures, and academic thinkers. Its '''historical roots''' lie in legitimate grievances over cultural exploitation – epitomized by the “plastic shaman” backlash and declarations by Native Americans to protect their sacred traditions. From there, neo-pagans (especially in the 2010s) adopted the terminology of ''closed vs. open'' practices as a way to navigate the ethics of borrowing in a post-colonial world. This framework has since permeated online discourse: on Tumblr dashboards and Discord chats, one finds young witches learning that some practices (like smudging, Hoodoo, or Kabbalah) are ''“closed – not for outsiders”''. They also learn that other practices (like Celtic polytheism or Wicca) are more open, or that proper initiation can grant entry across the threshold.

Academically, this phenomenon has been met with both affirmation and critique. '''Anthropologists and scholars of religion largely affirm the importance of respecting the wishes of source communities''', noting that cultural appropriation is harmful when it involves power imbalances and disrespect​&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@amyhale93/on-paganism-fakelore-and-tired-conversations-about-authenticity-10ab0c9537d0#:~:text=make%20the%20practices%20illegitimate%20or,in%20respectful%20and%20healthy%20circumstances&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://animalarchaeology.com/2018/07/16/what-is-old-is-new-again-cultural-appropriation/#:~:text=However%2C%20this%20masks%20the%20negative,can%20recreate%20imperialistic%20power%20structures&lt;/ref&gt;. At the same time, they caution against simplistic absolutism. Culture and religion are dynamic; one era’s closed practice may later spread legitimately through cross-cultural exchange (consider Buddhism’s travel from India across Asia, or Yoga’s global diffusion). The challenge, as scholars frame it, is to ensure '''mutual respect and consent''' guide any adoption of practices. As philosopher James O. Young wrote in a related context, the morality of using another culture’s art or rituals depends on factors like whether the source community consents or is harmed – not merely on the fact of cross-cultural use itself&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@amyhale93/on-paganism-fakelore-and-tired-conversations-about-authenticity-10ab0c9537d0#:~:text=make%20the%20practices%20illegitimate%20or,in%20respectful%20and%20healthy%20circumstances&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@amyhale93/on-paganism-fakelore-and-tired-conversations-about-authenticity-10ab0c9537d0#:~:text=Perfect%20unbroken%20transmission%20is%20nearly,a%20deep%20emotional%20core%20within&lt;/ref&gt;
.
From Catholic communion to Yoruba secret societies, we see that restricting spiritual practices is an age-old aspect of human societies – sometimes for internal theological reasons, sometimes as a shield against outside interference. The ''modern notion'' of a closed practice brings in an additional moral dimension: it asks, ''“By partaking in this practice, am I violating someone’s cultural sovereignty or trust?”'' This question has undoubtedly made modern Pagans more conscientious. It has sparked intense debates, but also deeper research and self-examination. '''Functional restrictions''' (like initiation requirements) and '''cultural boundaries''' (like ethnic lineage) both inform the label, and sometimes lead to overzealous claims (e.g. the erroneous idea that one needs “Celtic blood” to honor Celtic gods, rightly called out as misguided​&lt;ref&gt;https://ceallaighcreature.tumblr.com/#:~:text=%3E%20Semi,probably%20a%20racist%20at%20worst&lt;/ref&gt;). Yet at its best, the closed-practice discourse encourages a kind of '''ethical spirituality''' – one that strives to practice in a way that is both authentic to oneself ''and'' respectful toward the cultures one draws from.

In the online world, this discourse continues to develop. We now see community-generated lists of what’s closed, nuanced discussions about specific cases (e.g. ''Is Reiki a closed practice since it was once secret in Japan?''; ''Can non-Indigenous people participate in Ayahuasca ceremonies if invited?''; etc.), and even some fatigue and backlash in parts of the community. The push and pull will likely continue, but it has unquestionably altered the landscape of contemporary Pagan and New Age practice. A new practitioner in 2025 is far more likely to think twice about burning white sage or calling themselves a shaman than one in 1985 – a testament to the influence of this concept.

From an academic perspective, the conversation around closed practices is valuable because it forces recognition of '''historical injustices and the need for cultural humility'''. It also raises fascinating questions about the nature of tradition, ownership, and the transmission of knowledge. Scholars will undoubtedly keep studying online pagan forums and real-world communities to see how these ideas play out. As one recent volume on witchcraft studies put it, these debates are part of ''“decentering Europe”'' and challenging old paradigms in understanding witchcraft and religion​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317819957_Cultural_Appropriation_in_Contemporary_Neopaganism_and_Witchcraft#:~:text=that%20witches%20loom%20large%20in,in%20which%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20witch%E2%80%9D%20is&lt;/ref&gt;. In plain terms, the closed practice concept is one way marginalized voices are asserting their agency in the spiritual realm – saying ''“this is ours, handle with care.”''

Ultimately, most scholars and practitioners can agree on a middle ground principle: '''context and respect are everything'''. If a practice truly belongs to a living community that considers it closed, outsiders face an ethical mandate to honor that – whether that means abstaining or approaching through proper channels. Conversely, assuming every spiritual element is proprietary can lead to absurd or counterproductive outcomes. The key is ongoing dialogue, education, and empathy. The emergence of the closed practice concept, with all its contentions, has already prompted such dialogue on a wide scale – from academic conferences to coven meetings. It is an evolving example of how modern religious movements grapple with the legacy of colonialism and the meaning of authenticity in an interconnected world.

= The Risk of practices "becoming" closed practices =
With the common idea of "closed practices" often being substantially more respected than the actual beliefs of indigenous and minority religions, this leads to a risk where much like how many of these practices needed to alter their organizations to present themselves as "religions" there is a further risk that they may need to adopt this Judaism inspired model to present themselves as "closed practices" to gain desired treatment even if it goes contrary to their own beliefs.

With Kabbalah discourse 

== Introduction ==
The mystical tradition of '''Kabbalah''' has branched into multiple streams over the past five centuries. Notably, '''Christian Kabbalah''' (often spelled ''Cabala'') and '''Hermetic Qabalah''' developed within Christian and Western esoteric contexts, diverging greatly from their Jewish origins. Today, debates swirl around whether non-Jewish Kabbalistic practices constitute the appropriation of a Jewish ''“closed practice.”'' This report explores two interrelated issues: '''(1)''' the historical independence of Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah traditions and how their long evolution complicates claims of them being Jewish “closed practices,” and '''(2)''' the modern construction of the “closed practice” concept in neo-pagan and online communities, examining its impact on understanding religious traditions. The analysis draws on religious history, philosophy, and anthropology to unpack ideas of tradition ownership, syncretism, and the social dynamics of cultural gatekeeping.

== Part 1: Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah as Divergent Traditions ==

=== Origins and Major Texts of Christian Kabbalah ===
Christian interest in Kabbalah emerged in the Renaissance. In the late 15th century, scholars like '''Giovanni Pico della Mirandola''' and '''Johannes Reuchlin''' pioneered ''Christian Kabbalah'', integrating Jewish mystical ideas into a Christian theological framework​&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Kabbalah#:~:text=Christian%20Kabbalah%20arose%20during%20the,as%20a%20tool%20for%20conversion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10900/149678/Stengel_070.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y#:~:text=The%20so,as%20well%20as%20to%20Jewish&lt;/ref&gt;. Pico’s ''900 Theses'' (1486) included Kabbalistic propositions, and Reuchlin’s seminal works ''De verbo mirifico'' (1494) and ''De arte cabalistica'' (1517) adapted Kabbalistic symbolism to affirm Christian doctrines&lt;ref&gt;https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10900/149678/Stengel_070.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y#:~:text=as%20a%20kind%20of%20super,the%20interpretation%20of%20the%20Tetragrammaton&lt;/ref&gt;. A core motivation was the belief in a '''prisca theologia''' – an ancient, universal theology – which allowed Christians to interpret Kabbalah as a primordial truth pointing to Christianity&lt;ref&gt;https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10900/149678/Stengel_070.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y#:~:text=well%20as%20to%20Jewish%20post,This%20hegemonic&lt;/ref&gt;. Early Christian Kabbalists re-read Jewish mystical texts through a Christocentric lens. For example, they linked the ten '''Sefirot''' (divine emanations) to the Christian Trinity and other dogmas, even re-spelling the Hebrew name of God (YHWH) to include the letter ''shin'' (yielding ''YHSWH'') to reveal the name “Jesus”&lt;ref&gt;https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10900/149678/Stengel_070.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y#:~:text=aspects%20of%20soteriology%20related%20to,YHSWH%29%20became%20an&lt;/ref&gt;. Major figures of this era – Pico, Reuchlin, and '''Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa''' (who incorporated Kabbalah in ''De occulta philosophia'', 1510) – treated Kabbalah as a divinely inspired system that, properly decoded, proved Christian truth&lt;ref&gt;https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10900/149678/Stengel_070.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y#:~:text=Giovanni%20Pico%20della%20Miran%02dola%20%281463,religio%29%20to%20a%20prisca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10900/149678/Stengel_070.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y#:~:text=as%20a%20kind%20of%20super,the%20interpretation%20of%20the%20Tetragrammaton&lt;/ref&gt;.

Christian Kabbalah literature expanded in the 16th–17th centuries. '''Athanasius Kircher''', a Jesuit polymath, published Kabbalistic diagrams (e.g. the ''Tree of Life'') in ''Œdipus Ægyptiacus'' (1652), and '''Christian Knorr von Rosenroth''' compiled ''Kabbala Denudata'' (1677–84), translating portions of Jewish Kabbalistic texts into Latin. These works were not simply translations; they often included commentary aligning with Christian '''angelology''' and cosmology​&lt;ref&gt;https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10900/149678/Stengel_070.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y#:~:text=meaning%20of%20the%20HB%20on,literal%20content%2C%20but%20also%20inserted&lt;/ref&gt;. By the 18th century, however, Christian Kabbalah’s influence waned in theology. As the Enlightenment took hold, Christian Kabbalah survived mostly in occult circles&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Kabbalah#:~:text=such%20as%20Athanasius%20Kircher%20,ideas%2C%20influencing%20later%20esoteric%20traditions&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Independence from Jewish Kabbalah:''' It is crucial to note that ''Christian Kabbalah should be expressly differentiated from Jewish Kabbalah''&lt;ref&gt;https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10900/149678/Stengel_070.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y#:~:text=The%20so,appealing%20to%20the%20OT%20as&lt;/ref&gt;. From the start, Christian Kabbalists operated largely ''outside'' the living Jewish tradition, using Jewish sources but reinterpreting them without authorization from Jewish authorities. Their agenda—finding Christ in Kabbalah—was foreign to Judaism, and sometimes explicitly aimed at conversion of Jews&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Kabbalah#:~:text=Christian%20scholars%20interpreted%20Kabbalistic%20ideas,back%20against%20the%20Jews%20to&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Kabbalah#:~:text=to%20transform%20Kabbalah%20into%20,5&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, although Christian Cabala borrowed Hebrew terms and concepts, it quickly became a self-contained tradition within Christian mysticism. Historian Gershom Scholem observed that these Christian interpretations often amounted to a ''“dogmatic weapon”'' against Jews&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Kabbalah#:~:text=Christian%20scholars%20interpreted%20Kabbalistic%20ideas,back%20against%20the%20Jews%20to&lt;/ref&gt;, underscoring how divergent the intent and context were from Jewish practice.

=== Origins and Major Texts of Hermetic Qabalah ===
In the 19th century, a revival and transformation occurred within Western esotericism: the rise of '''Hermetic Qabalah'''. This tradition emerged out of the Renaissance Christian Cabalistic corpus, but was further syncretized with Hermeticism, alchemy, astrology, and magic​&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Qabalah#:~:text=Hermetic%20Qabalah%20arose%20from%20Christian,many%20concepts%20with%20Jewish%20Kabbalah&lt;/ref&gt;. Hermetic Qabalah became the mystical backbone of organizations like the '''Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn''' (founded 1888) and, later, Aleister Crowley’s '''A∴A∴''' and the '''Ordo Templi Orientis'''. Key texts in this lineage include S.L. MacGregor Mathers’ ''The Kabbalah Unveiled'' (1887), which presented Kabbalistic teachings to an English-speaking occult audience, and '''Dion Fortune’s''' ''The Mystical Qabalah'' (1935), a comprehensive handbook linking the Sefirot to Western mystery symbolism&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Qabalah#:~:text=Dion%20Fortune%2C%20an%20initiate%20of,general%20introductions%20to%20modern%20Hermetic&lt;/ref&gt;. Fortune’s work in particular is considered one of the best introductions to modern Hermetic Qabalah, systematizing the correspondences between the Kabbalistic Tree of Life and Tarot, astrology, and classical elements&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Qabalah#:~:text=Dion%20Fortune%2C%20an%20initiate%20of,general%20introductions%20to%20modern%20Hermetic&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Hermetic Qabalah''' differs from both Jewish and Christian forms by its highly eclectic nature. As one synopsis explains, ''“Hermetic Qabalah arose from Christian Cabala… becoming variously esoteric Christian, non-Christian, or anti-Christian across its different schools in the modern era.”'' It ''“draws on many influences, most notably Jewish Kabbalah, Western astrology, Alchemy, Pagan religions (especially Egyptian and Greco-Roman), Neoplatonism, Hermeticism, and the symbolism of the Tarot.”'' In short, Hermetic Qabalah is a ''syncretic'' system, freely combining elements from disparate traditions​&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Qabalah#:~:text=Hermetic%20Qabalah%20arose%20from%20Christian,many%20concepts%20with%20Jewish%20Kabbalah&lt;/ref&gt;. Its '''Tree of Life''' diagram – adapted from earlier Kabbalistic sources – became a kind of universal map onto which occultists mapped planets, alchemical processes, and even Jungian archetypes. Importantly, Hermetic Qabalists did not limit themselves to Jewish exegesis; they read Kabbalah as ''“universalist ancient wisdom”'' rather than as a uniquely Jewish mystical path&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah#:~:text=Hermetic%20%20occultists.,and%20divination%2C%20Kabbalah%20acquired%20some&lt;/ref&gt;.

By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Hermetic Qabalah had firmly established itself as an independent pillar of the '''Western Mystery Tradition'''. Members of the Golden Dawn and its offshoots produced an extensive occult literature that treated the Qabalistic schema as Western esoteric lore. For example, Israel Regardie’s publications on Golden Dawn teachings and Aleister Crowley’s works (''777'', ''Sepher Sephiroth'', etc.) integrated Qabalistic terminology while largely divorcing it from Jewish ritual or covenantal context.

=== Long-Standing Independence from Judaic Kabbalah ===
Both Christian Cabala and Hermetic Qabalah have had '''centuries of evolution separate from Jewish Kabbalah'''. By entering non-Jewish cultural spheres in the Renaissance, these traditions ''“developed independently of Judaic Kabbalah, reading the Jewish texts as universalist ancient wisdom… [and] adapted the Jewish concepts freely from their Jewish understanding, to merge with multiple other theologies, religious traditions and magical associations.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah#:~:text=Hermetic%20%20occultists.,and%20divination%2C%20Kabbalah%20acquired%20some&lt;/ref&gt;. In other words, once Kabbalistic ideas were adopted by Christian mystics and occultists, they underwent interpretive transformation and took on a life of their own. The '''syncretic''' character of these offshoots meant that over time they incorporated meanings and practices that '''no orthodox Jewish Kabbalist would recognize''' as their own. For instance, Jewish Kabbalah developed in the 16th century through '''Lurianic''' theology (with concepts like ''Tzimtzum'' and ''Tikkun''), and later through Hasidic spirituality – developments that largely did not penetrate Christian or Hermetic Kabbalah. Conversely, Hermetic Qabalah’s integration of Tarot cards or Egyptian gods has no basis in Jewish sources; these are distinctly non-Jewish accretions. By the '''Age of Reason''' (18th century), Christian Cabala had declined, but Hermetic Qabalah persisted as an ''“underground tradition in Western esotericism”'', adding layers of occult ''“connotations”'' to Kabbalah that were ''forbidden within Judaism''&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah#:~:text=from%20their%20Jewish%20understanding%2C%20to,rather%20than%20giving%20an%20accurate&lt;/ref&gt;(e.g. overt magic and divination).

This long-standing independence raises an intriguing question: Can Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah be considered ''Jewish'' practices at all, let alone “closed” Jewish practices, given how far removed they are from any Jewish community’s sanction or transmission? From a historical perspective, these currents functioned outside of Jewish communal bounds for hundreds of years. They had their own '''lineages''' of teaching (e.g. Christian Hebraists teaching other Christian scholars; Golden Dawn initiates teaching their pupils), their own '''major texts and commentaries''', and goals often opposed to those of Jewish mystics. In effect, Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah became new traditions ''inspired'' by Jewish Kabbalah, rather than branches of Judaism. Scholars of religion would classify them under '''Western esotericism''' or Christian mysticism, not as part of Jewish religious practice​&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah#:~:text=Hermetic%20%20occultists.,and%20divination%2C%20Kabbalah%20acquired%20some&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Qabalah#:~:text=influences%2C%20most%20notably%3A%20Jewish%20Kabbalah,many%20concepts%20with%20Jewish%20Kabbalah&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Syncretism, Appropriation, and Tradition Ownership ===
The evolution of Christian Cabala and Hermetic Qabalah exemplifies the complex boundary between '''syncretism''' and '''cultural appropriation'''. Syncretism refers to blending elements from different traditions to create something new, whereas cultural appropriation involves adopting elements of a culture (often a marginalized one) in a way deemed disrespectful or detached from their original context. Renaissance Christian Kabbalists saw their project as syncretic and even ''ecumenical'' – an attempt to reconcile religions in a universal theology​&lt;ref&gt;https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10900/149678/Stengel_070.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y#:~:text=well%20as%20to%20Jewish%20post,This%20hegemonic&lt;/ref&gt;. However, from a Jewish standpoint, this “reconciliation” was one-sided and instrumental. Indeed, some historians note a '''hegemonic impulse''' in Christian Kabbalah: it often treated Judaism as incomplete truth to be fulfilled by Christianity&lt;ref&gt;https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10900/149678/Stengel_070.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y#:~:text=philosophia%20catholica,satisfaction%20and%20im%02putation%2C%20are%20transformed&lt;/ref&gt;. The power dynamics were evident – Christians (often from a majority culture) were extracting and reinterpreting a minority tradition for their own theological ends. This is a classic scenario of appropriation, albeit one occurring in the 15th–17th centuries rather than in today’s pop culture. A contemporary Jewish writer bluntly states that Kabbalah ''“is unquestioningly a closed practice, and cannot be fully understood outside of the context of Judaism. Yet the appropriation of Kabbalah goes back centuries.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rootsmetals.com/blogs/news/judaism-is-a-closed-practice#:~:text=match%20at%20L840%20until%20they,of%20Kabbalah%20goes%20back%20centuries&lt;/ref&gt;. From this view, Christian and Hermetic adaptations – no matter how old – began as appropriation of Jewish sacred knowledge.

However, the '''passage of time and independent evolution''' muddle the ethical verdict. Over centuries, Christian and Hermetic Kabbalists developed their own '''interpretive communities''', arguably creating distinct mystical systems. By the 20th century, a Hermetic Qabalist learning the Tree of Life from a Golden Dawn manual is inheriting a primarily ''Western occult lineage'', not taking teachings directly from living Jewish sages. Does the ''origin'' of the ideas in medieval Kabbalah still make it a Jewish “closed practice”? Or has it become an '''open Western esoteric practice''', albeit one with Jewish roots? Scholars of religion and philosophy of tradition have different perspectives on '''“ownership”''' of spiritual traditions. Some argue that religious ideas cannot be owned or copyrighted – once knowledge is published or revealed, it enters the realm of humanity’s shared heritage (barring secret rites). Others counter that communities have a right to guard their esoteric knowledge and that using such knowledge out of context can be harmful or sacrilegious. In the case of Kabbalah, Jewish Kabbalists historically imposed restrictions (study reserved for learned Jews above a certain age and piety), effectively treating it as ''closed within Judaism''. But they had no mechanism to enforce those norms on Christian scholars. The result was a form of '''lineage rupture''': Christian Cabalists learned from Jewish texts but did not become part of the Jewish chain of transmission (they created their own chain). From a '''lineage''' standpoint, Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah lineages are separate and self-contained.

This independence does not erase the fact that these movements drew on Jewish intellectual property, so to speak. But it does mean that labeling them simply as ''Jewish'' practices may be inaccurate. They are better seen as '''derivative traditions''': related to Judaism historically, yet distinct in practice and authority. The claim that non-Jewish Kabbalah is a “closed Jewish practice” becomes problematic when applied to someone studying Hermetic Qabalah today, because that person is likely engaging with a corpus and community far removed from any Jewish authority. In other words, the ''cultural context'' has shifted. A parallel might be drawn to '''Christianity’s use of the Hebrew Bible''': Christians appropriated Jewish scripture, reinterpreting it as the Old Testament pointing to Christ. While Jews might see that as appropriation of their sacred text, Christianity grew into a separate religion; today a Christian reading Isaiah is not expected to seek Jewish permission – the text and its interpretation have long since entered a ''different interpretive universe''. By analogy, one could argue that Hermetic Qabalah has become a ''different interpretive universe'' for Kabbalistic symbols.

=== Retroactive Claims of Appropriation ===
The issue of '''retroactive cultural appropriation''' arises when modern sensibilities judge historical interactions. Renaissance Christians did not frame their engagement with Kabbalah in terms of cultural theft – concepts of intellectual property or “closed practice” were not in play; instead, they saw truth as universal (albeit fulfilled in their religion). Likewise, 19th-century occultists saw themselves as ''esoteric researchers'', mining all cultures for wisdom. Today, activists might critique those past actions as exploitative or orientalist. Such critiques can be illuminating, but they also struggle with the fact that centuries have passed. The Christian Cabalists and occultists are long dead; their works, for better or worse, contributed to Western esoteric thought. Thus, while a Jewish scholar can point out the ''misinterpretations and removal from context'' in Christian/Hermetic Kabbalah, it may be impractical to consider those entire traditions illegitimate or off-limits now – they have an identity of their own.

Moreover, contrasts are often made with '''more recent appropriations'''. For example, the appropriation of Native American ceremonies by New Age practitioners in the last few decades is an ''ongoing'' concern, where living communities today object to misuse of their rites. In those cases, the '''original custodians of the practice are actively resisting appropriation in real time'''. By contrast, Jewish reactions to Christian Kabbalah occurred in a very different historical milieu (Jews of the Renaissance had little power to protest in Christian courts, though some did quietly criticize the distortions). In modern times, many Jews are unaware of Hermetic Qabalah unless they encounter it in occult or interfaith contexts; it’s somewhat niche. Thus, while the '''principle''' of respecting closed practices can be applied (Kabbalah being deeply embedded in Judaism), the ''pragmatics'' of treating Christian/Hermetic Kabbalah as verboten is tricky. It would entail, for instance, forbidding a non-Jewish occultist from using the ''Tree of Life'' diagram even if their group has done so for generations. Some Jewish voices indeed advocate that non-Jews desist from Kabbalistic study unless they properly convert or contextualize in Judaism​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rootsmetals.com/blogs/news/judaism-is-a-closed-practice#:~:text=match%20at%20L840%20until%20they,of%20Kabbalah%20goes%20back%20centuries&lt;/ref&gt;. On the other hand, philosophical perspectives on syncretism suggest that religious traditions are dynamic – ideas migrate and get transformed. '''No tradition is born in a vacuum'''; even Jewish Kabbalah itself absorbed Neoplatonic and Gnostic influences in medieval times. Does that make Kabbalah guilty of appropriating earlier pagan philosophy? Most would not frame it that way, because those ideas were thoroughly ''naturalized'' into the Jewish worldview. Similarly, Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah naturalized Jewish ideas into their worldviews. The ethical evaluation might differ (due to power imbalances and the question of permission), but the mechanism – cross-cultural borrowing – is a historically common one.

In summary, Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah present a complex case where '''syncretism and independent development''' over centuries make simple labels of “closed practice” difficult to apply. These traditions underscore that once knowledge is transmitted, it can undergo radical reinterpretation. Whether one views this as ''illegitimate cultural appropriation'' or as the ''organic evolution of spiritual ideas'' often depends on one’s stance on who “owns” culture and whether sacred knowledge can be universal. The historical reality is that Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah have operated as largely ''autonomous traditions'' apart from Judaism​&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah#:~:text=Hermetic%20%20occultists.,and%20divination%2C%20Kabbalah%20acquired%20some&lt;/ref&gt;. This does not erase their Jewish origin, but it does mean any discussion of them as “Jewish practices” must acknowledge the substantial '''distance''' (in time, interpretation, and community) from the Jewish context.

== Part 2: Constructing “Closed Practices” and Neo-Pagan Online Dynamics ==

=== “Closed Practices” as a Modern Construct ===
The term '''“closed practice”''' has gained currency in recent years, especially in neo-pagan, witchcraft, and online spiritual communities. It denotes a spiritual practice or tradition that is restricted to a certain group – often by '''ethnicity, lineage, or initiation status''' – and which outsiders should not participate in without permission. Examples commonly cited include Native American ceremonies, African diasporic religions (like Vodou or Ifá), or indeed Judaism and Kabbalah. It is important to recognize that the idea of labeling practices as “closed” or “open” is a product of contemporary discourse. In fact, scholars have noted that the very category of “religion” is itself a modern Western construct that was not universal​&lt;ref&gt;https://womrel.sitehost.iu.edu/Rel433%20Readings/01_SearchableTextFiles/Asad_ConstructionOfReligionAnthroCategory.pdf#:~:text=category%20of%20belief%20but%20of,developed%20in%20the%20essay%20by&lt;/ref&gt;. Just as '''“religion” had to be defined and invented''' in certain contexts (for instance, when Western scholars and colonial administrators tried to classify Asian traditions in the 19th century), the notion of “closed practices” is a '''conceptual schema''' that has emerged from particular social concerns and conversations, rather than a timeless principle.

Analyses like Jason Josephson-Storm’s ''The Invention of Religion in Japan'' show that what counts as “a religion” was actively defined in modern times, often for political and comparative purposes​&lt;ref&gt;https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo13657764.html#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D&lt;/ref&gt;. Similarly, the classification of some practices as '''“closed”''' can be seen as a '''social invention''' of late 20th and early 21st-century thought. It arises from heightened awareness of cultural appropriation and the rights of indigenous and marginalized peoples. In academic terms, one might say we are witnessing the ''discursive construction'' of the category “closed practice.” Anthropologist '''Talal Asad''' famously argued that even the attempt to define “religion” universally ''“is itself the historical product of discursive processes”'' tied to Western modernity&lt;ref&gt;https://womrel.sitehost.iu.edu/Rel433%20Readings/01_SearchableTextFiles/Asad_ConstructionOfReligionAnthroCategory.pdf#:~:text=category%20of%20belief%20but%20of,developed%20in%20the%20essay%20by&lt;/ref&gt;. By extension, defining what counts as a “closed” versus “open” spiritual practice is a discourse that reflects contemporary values – particularly values of cultural sovereignty, anti-colonialism, and identity politics.

This is not to say that the concept is invalid, but rather that it is ''situated''. Different cultures traditionally had their own ways of regulating sacred knowledge (through initiation, taboo, etc.), but the umbrella term “closed practice” packages many disparate customs into a single category governed by modern sensibilities. '''Suzanne Owen’s''' work on the notion of “indigenous religion” is instructive here. Owen examines how the category “Indigenous Religion” was formulated in scholarly and political arenas, often lumping diverse traditions together for strategic reasons (such as asserting rights or authenticity)​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/appropriation-of-native-american-spirituality-9781441185303/#:~:text=Native%20Americans%20and%20Canadians%20are,and%20perspective%20to%20these%20debates&lt;/ref&gt;. In one analysis, Owen notes that modern representations of Native American spirituality were frequently romanticized or homogenized with ''“little concern for the diversity of Native American opinions.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/appropriation-of-native-american-spirituality-9781441185303/#:~:text=Native%20Americans%20and%20Canadians%20are,and%20perspective%20to%20these%20debates&lt;/ref&gt;This critique can be applied to “closed practice” rhetoric: by making a blanket rule that a practice is closed, one might ignore internal diversity and debates within that tradition.

=== Neo-Pagan and Online Communities’ Use of “Closed Practice” ===
In neo-pagan and witchcraft communities online (on platforms like Tumblr, TikTok, Reddit, etc.), lists of “closed practices” are often shared as guidelines for ethical spirituality. These lists typically caution against non-initiates using Palo Santo or white sage (indigenous smudging herbs), against laypeople invoking '''Orishas''' (Yoruba deities) without initiation, against non-Jews doing Kabbalistic ritual, and so on. The intent – coming from a good place – is to encourage respect and prevent culturally insensitive appropriation. However, a striking feature of much of this discourse is a '''lack of deep engagement with the specific content or structure of the original traditions'''. In other words, the policing is ''generic''. A young witch on Tumblr might declare something like, “Vodou is a closed practice, do not do voodoo spells if you’re not initiated.” While this statement has truth (Vodou societies do require initiation for many practices), the person saying it often has not studied Vodou themselves or spoken to a Vodou priest; they are parroting a general rule they’ve heard. The '''focus is on the identity of the practitioner''' (insider vs outsider) rather than on the nuances of the practice itself.

This phenomenon can flatten the rich complexity of religious traditions. '''Blanket categorizations''' can indeed ''erase internal diversity or dissent'' within the source culture. For instance, in reality '''not all members of a given community agree''' on sharing practices. Some Native American elders have chosen to teach non-Natives (consider the '''Native American Church''' which has both Native and non-Native members using peyote in a controlled, respectful setting). Some others vehemently oppose any sharing. By labeling the entire sphere “closed” in an online post, those nuances are lost. As Owen pointed out in the Native American context, debates over appropriation often proceed with minimal input from the full range of Native voices​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/appropriation-of-native-american-spirituality-9781441185303/#:~:text=Native%20Americans%20and%20Canadians%20are,and%20perspective%20to%20these%20debates&lt;/ref&gt;. Similarly, among Jews, there is a spectrum of views on teaching Kabbalah to non-Jews – from stringent opposition to more openness in certain Kabbalistic schools or modern outreach movements. Yet the online narrative may simplistically assert, “Kabbalah is closed: non-Jews ''cannot'' understand it,” sweeping aside the fact that some Kabbalists historically did interact with non-Jewish seekers. The '''diversity within traditions''' – based on different theological interpretations, historical circumstances, or personal attitudes – gets obscured when outsiders impose a single label of closed/open.

Another issue is '''outsiders policing insiders'''. In online forums, one sometimes sees non-members of a culture shushing actual members. For example, a well-meaning pagan might tell a person of Jewish heritage who is sharing Kabbalistic insight, “Be careful, Kabbalah is a closed practice, you shouldn’t share that.” The irony is thick: someone outside the tradition is ''overruling or policing an individual from that culture''. There have been cases in neo-pagan spaces where, say, a Native person explained a certain practice and was then lectured by non-Natives about how that practice is closed and they shouldn’t be discussing it publicly. This paternalistic dynamic can be problematic. It raises questions: '''Who has the authority to declare a practice closed?''' Ideally, one would think the community of origin decides. But online, authority often defaults to whoever projects a morally righteous stance. It leads to what we might call ''performative allyship'' or ''performative indigeneity'' – people zealously guarding someone else’s tradition to display their own enlightenment.

=== Performative Gatekeeping and Community Governance ===
The discourse around closed practices in online communities has a strong '''performative and normative''' element. Declaring something “closed” is not just an informative statement; it’s a signal of the speaker’s values. It says: ''“I stand against cultural appropriation. I am a respectful practitioner.”'' Sociologically, this functions as a way to establish credibility and moral high ground within the community. There is an element of '''community governance''': group moderators and experienced members set rules (“No discussion of smudging, it’s closed unless you’re Indigenous,” or “Don’t use the word ‘spirit animal,’ that’s appropriation”). These rules are then enforced through social sanction (calling out, education, or sometimes dogpiling and shaming). The intentions are often to create a safe and respectful environment, but the ''methods and knowledge base'' can be shaky.

One observed pattern is that arguments about closed practices are often '''shaped more by social-justice theory than by theology or ethnography'''. In other words, participants rely on general principles about power and harm rather than detailed knowledge of the practice’s spiritual logic. For instance, few of the online arbiters could explain ''why'' in Yoruba religion one must be initiated to work with Orishas (the theological reasoning or ritual mechanisms); they just know that allowing uninitiated outsiders has been decried as harmful appropriation of Afro-Caribbean culture. The conversation is framed in terms of ''cultural ownership and historical oppression'' (“white colonizers took so much, so don’t take this too”) rather than the ''internal sacred logic'' of the tradition (“certain knowledge is kept esoteric to preserve its power and integrity among initiates”). These social arguments are valid, especially given colonial histories, but they aren’t the full story of the traditions themselves. An ethnographic approach might reveal, for example, that some traditions have protocols for adopting outsiders (many Afro-diasporic religions do allow non-ethnic members if they commit to initiation and the community – which complicates the label “closed” as a binary). A theological approach might consider that some religions actively seek converts (which makes them “open” in intention despite being ethnically rooted, like Buddhism or certain Hindu lineages accepting Westerners). The “closed practice” label, however, tends to present a static picture: you’re either in or out by birth or secret initiation, case closed.

Anthropologists and scholars have critiqued this static view. Notably, the very idea of sharply bounded, homogenous “cultures” is something anthropology has moved away from – cultures are porous and have contested boundaries. The closed practice discourse can paradoxically echo an old anthropological fallacy: treating cultures as monoliths with strict fences. It sometimes ignores '''historical change''' and '''internal debate'''. For example, '''“Indigenous religion”''' as a category often had to be negotiated in international forums (like the United Nations or the AAR) to even be recognized; it’s not that all indigenous peoples naturally thought of themselves as having “religions” – that classification was in part a response to external pressures and the need for a collective voice. Suzanne Owen’s research highlights how groups like British Druids have even tried to claim the label “indigenous religion” to gain legitimacy, which shows how fluid and constructed these labels can be​&lt;ref&gt;https://leedstrinity.academia.edu/SuzanneOwen#:~:text=&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/2580977/Druidry_and_the_Definition_of_Indigenous_Religion#:~:text=This%20book%20will%20further%20our,defining%20and%20contextualizing%20the&lt;/ref&gt;. In online neo-pagan contexts, invoking “closed practice” is a way of drawing lines, but those lines may be based on external social narratives more than the '''emic''' (insider) categories of the traditions.

This is not to say the concern is misplaced – indeed, many traditions '''do''' have sacred knowledge not meant for casual public use, and appropriation ''can'' cause real harm or offense. The closed practice norm in online communities serves as a blunt tool to prevent obvious harms (like someone mimicking a Lakota Sundance without any guidance – clearly dangerous and disrespectful). The challenge is that as a blunt tool, it can also '''overreach or misfire'''. It may label something as off-limits even when the tradition itself might allow a path for outsiders, or it may shut down legitimate intercultural exchange and learning. Furthermore, because the enforcement is social, it can devolve into performance and identity-policing where nuance is lost. In extreme cases, forums become more about ''demonstrating one’s anti-colonial credentials'' than about genuinely engaging with the richness of different spiritual paths.

=== Social vs. Theological Framing of “Closed” ===
A key observation is that '''social-media debates on closed practices are rooted in social ethics''' rather than in the theological self-understanding of the religions in question. We see a collision of frameworks: ''Social justice activism'' meets ''religious tradition''. Each has its own language. Activists talk of privilege, power imbalance, oppression, and respect. Practitioners of a tradition might talk of ancestors, purity, initiation vows, or the wrath of spirits when protocols are broken. Sometimes the activist framework and the tradition’s framework align (e.g. both agree outsiders shouldn’t barge in), but other times they misalign. For example, some Afro-diasporic priests may have no political objection to an outsider seeking initiation (they might even welcome the respect shown by doing it properly), yet an outside activist might still criticize a non-black person for adopting an “African” religion, seeing it through a racial lens of appropriation. Here the '''social logic (outsider appropriating marginalized culture)''' conflicts with the '''internal logic (the Orisha accepts devotees regardless of race if they undergo the proper rituals)'''. Which logic prevails in online discourse? Often, it’s the social one, because the arbiters are peers on social media rather than authorities from within the tradition.

This dynamic can lead to situations where '''individuals from a culture can be “gatekept” by outsiders''' who claim to protect that culture. It also leads to a phenomenon where people accumulate a kind of informal social capital by identifying and calling out instances of supposed appropriation. There is performativity in being the one to say “No, that’s closed, you can’t use it,” especially if one doesn’t belong to that group – it shows one’s awareness and allyship. Meanwhile, actual members of the culture might have varied opinions that are not monolithic.

In academic circles, there is growing critique of applying simplistic identity politics to religious practice. Scholars like '''Suzanne Owen''' and others in the study of indigenous religions caution that we must listen to ''insider debates'' and avoid treating any tradition as having a single voice. The case of “neo-pagan appropriation of Native American spirituality” has been studied to show both the objections raised by many Native people and the nuanced ways in which some neo-pagans attempt to indigenize their own practices​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/appropriation-of-native-american-spirituality-9781441185303/#:~:text=Native%20Americans%20and%20Canadians%20are,and%20perspective%20to%20these%20debates&lt;/ref&gt;. The lesson is that issues of appropriation are '''context-dependent'''. The ''history'' of relations between the groups, the ''power dynamics'', and the ''sacred meanings'' all matter. Online “closed practice” discourse sometimes reduces this to a checklist – which, while easy to follow, might bypass context.

To tie back to Part 1 with an example: In online communities, one often sees Judaism and Kabbalah listed as closed. Judaism is indeed not a proselytizing religion and has barriers to conversion (one must formally convert to be considered Jewish). Kabbalah, as traditionally taught, required being an observant Jew well-versed in Torah/Talmud, etc. So on the face of it, calling it closed is aligning with those facts. Yet, the '''history of Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah''' complicates this, as we discussed. The online community, in many cases, is ''not aware of that history in detail'' – they enforce the closed label without acknowledging that ''the horse has long left the barn'', so to speak, with Kabbalah ideas permeating Western esotericism. Indeed, you might encounter neo-pagans who simultaneously say “Kabbalah is closed, don’t use it,” and then in another breath talk about their favorite Tarot spread (oblivious that Tarot’s incorporation of the Tree of Life is itself a product of Hermetic Qabalah). This highlights a certain ''incoherence born of superficial knowledge'': the content of the practice (like occult Tarot reading) has Kabbalistic elements, but the policing happens at the level of labels (“don’t use Hebrew godnames, that’s closed”). The discourse is driven by ''social awareness'' (do’s and don’ts gleaned from community norms) rather than a holistic understanding of how these symbols have traveled.

=== Constructive Paths Forward ===
Anthropological critiques of religious classification urge us to approach these matters with nuance and respect for actual practitioners. Instead of relying solely on broad labels, engaging with the '''lineages, permissions, and transformations''' of a practice can be more fruitful. For neo-pagan communities, this might mean encouraging research and perhaps dialogue with members of the source traditions. It also means accepting complexity: for example, understanding that '''syncretism''' has been a driving force in religious history (not always a nefarious one) and that '''borrowing can occur alongside respect'''. The difference between harmful appropriation and creative syncretism often lies in ''consent, context, and the power balance''. When Aleister Crowley, a British occultist, took Jewish, Egyptian, and Hindu concepts and mixed them, he was participating in a long Western esoteric habit of seeing the world’s traditions as a smörgåsbord of symbols – a very ''colonial'' approach in hindsight, assuming everything is there for the taking. Today’s practitioners are trying to be more conscientious, which is commendable. The challenge is doing so in an informed, rather than performative, way.

Suzanne Owen’s examination of how “indigenous religion” is defined suggests the need for reflexivity – understanding that our categories (be it “religion” or “closed”) are shaped by our contemporary interests​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/appropriation-of-native-american-spirituality-9781441185303/#:~:text=Native%20Americans%20and%20Canadians%20are,and%20perspective%20to%20these%20debates&lt;/ref&gt;. The concept of '''“ownership” of traditions''' is itself debated in philosophy. Some argue that spiritual knowledge is not a commodity and framing it in terms of ownership might inadvertently impose a modern property-based model on something that traditionally was governed by other logics (like kinship or initiatory lineage). Others rightly point out that in a world of unequal power, ''not'' talking about ownership allows dominant groups to continue exploitative behavior unchecked. Thus, there is a tension between universalist and particularist views of spiritual culture.

In the end, what becomes clear is that '''dialogue and education''' are preferable to fiat declarations. If one is drawn to a practice that might be “closed,” the respectful approach is to learn ''why'' it is considered closed, and if appropriate, seek legitimate pathways (such as formal conversion or apprenticeship) or else choose a different path. For those doing the policing in communities, a more informed approach would involve citing voices from within the tradition (for example, if saying something is closed, perhaps link to a Native person explaining why their ceremony is not for outsiders). This makes the conversation more grounded in the '''actual community’s stance''' rather than an abstract rule.

The discourse on closed practices, much like the academic discourse on “what counts as religion,” is evolving. It reflects a larger societal attempt to balance '''respect for cultural diversity''' with the reality of '''global interconnectedness'''. Religions have always interacted and sometimes collided – the current generation is wrestling with how to do so ethically. By understanding the history of cross-cultural interactions (like the case of Kabbalah’s journey through Christian and occult hands) and by critically examining our own categories, we can hopefully avoid both the naivety of uncritical borrowing and the rigidity of uninformed gatekeeping. The goal should be to honor the '''lineage and living stakeholders''' of any spiritual practice, while also acknowledging the shared human curiosity that has always led people to seek wisdom beyond the bounds of their birth culture.

== Conclusion ==
'''Christian Kabbalah and Hermetic Qabalah''' demonstrate that religious traditions can, over time, branch off and establish themselves as independent systems, even when they originated in a closed or context-specific practice. Their centuries-long divergence from Jewish Kabbalah complicates simple claims of ownership: they are rooted in Jewish mysticism yet are not synonymous with it. This historical perspective urges caution in retroactively applying modern labels like “closed practice” without nuance. It illustrates that '''syncretism and reinterpretation''' – however controversial – have been part of religious history, raising questions about how we define a tradition’s boundaries and who has the authority to do so.

'''The modern idea of “closed practices,”''' as used in neo-pagan and online circles, is a well-intentioned construct aimed at preventing exploitation of marginalized spiritual traditions. However, as a construct, it has inherent limitations. It tends to simplify complex traditions and can inadvertently silence the very voices it seeks to protect by imposing external consensus over internal debate. The analysis here suggests that while respecting closed practices is important, one must also critically assess how those closures are defined and by whom. The '''performative aspect''' of online closed-practice discourse highlights that these debates often serve social and community-regulatory functions. They are as much about signalling group values and enforcing norms as about the traditions themselves.

By incorporating insights from religious studies and anthropology, we see that concepts like “religion” or “indigenous tradition” have always been negotiated and ''invented'' to some extent​&lt;ref&gt;https://womrel.sitehost.iu.edu/Rel433%20Readings/01_SearchableTextFiles/Asad_ConstructionOfReligionAnthroCategory.pdf#:~:text=category%20of%20belief%20but%20of,developed%20in%20the%20essay%20by&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/appropriation-of-native-american-spirituality-9781441185303/#:~:text=Native%20Americans%20and%20Canadians%20are,and%20perspective%20to%20these%20debates&lt;/ref&gt;
. “Closed practice” is no different. It is a category we are in the process of inventing and refining. The challenge and opportunity moving forward is to ground this category in genuine '''dialogue with source communities''' and careful understanding of each tradition’s nature. Rather than blanket proclamations, a case-by-case approach that considers '''history, power relations, and the voices of practitioners''' will yield better ethical guidance.

In sum, the intersection of Kabbalah’s multi-religious history with today’s identity-conscious spirituality discourse teaches us that '''ownership of tradition is not a straightforward matter'''. It involves lineage, context, and consent. Respecting a tradition means not only keeping out when required, but also truly appreciating its depth and listening to those who carry it. As we navigate a pluralistic world, both the borrowers and the gatekeepers have much to learn from each other. The hope is for a respectful engagement that honors the sacred while fostering mutual understanding – a balance between guarding what must be cherished and recognizing the shared human quest that underlies all spiritual seeking.

= Cultural Appropriation and Shinto: Global Perspectives and Practices =

== Official Shinto Positions on Non-Japanese Participation ==
Shinto authorities have explicitly addressed whether non-Japanese can take part in Shinto. The Association of Shinto Shrines (神社本庁 ''Jinja Honchō''), which oversees about 80,000 shrines in Japan, emphasizes that Shinto is open to anyone who approaches it with respect. In its official English ''Q&amp;A'', Jinja Honchō makes clear there is '''no formal conversion process''' in Shinto – one does not “become” a Shintoist in the way one might formally convert to another religion​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/faq/#:~:text=Shinto%20is%20not%20the%20sort,religion%2C%20or%20as%20being%20Buddhist&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, ''“Shinto is something that you do, rather than something that you are,”'' and it is fully compatible with simultaneously adhering to other faiths or none&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/faq/#:~:text=Shinto%20is%20not%20the%20sort,religion%2C%20or%20as%20being%20Buddhist&lt;/ref&gt;
. Some key points from Jinja Honchō and other Shinto institutions include:

* '''Open Access to Shrines:''' There are no restrictions barring outsiders from shrine grounds. Shrines (''jinja'') are considered public, communal spaces open to everyone, regardless of religious background​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/faq/#:~:text=All%20jinja%20are%20public%20in,religion%2C%20and%20this%20is%20respected&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/faq/#:~:text=There%20are%20no%20specific%20restrictions,a%20polite%20and%20sincere%20manner&lt;/ref&gt;Visitors of any faith may enter and worship, provided they behave respectfully and maintain the dignity of the sacred space&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/faq/#:~:text=There%20are%20no%20specific%20restrictions,a%20polite%20and%20sincere%20manner&lt;/ref&gt;. In Jinja Honchō’s words, ''“all jinja are public in the sense that they are open to everyone”''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/faq/#:~:text=All%20jinja%20are%20public%20in,religion%2C%20and%20this%20is%20respected&lt;/ref&gt;. Non-Shinto or non-Japanese guests are welcomed to participate in rituals (such as the bowing and clapping prayer etiquette) as long as it is done sincerely and politely.
* '''No Concept of Conversion or Exclusivity:''' Shinto has no baptism or confession of faith to mark “conversion.” Jinja Honchō explicitly states that ''“you are welcome to practise Shinto, both by visiting jinja in Japan, and in personal practice at home”'', without any formal initiation&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/faq/#:~:text=Shinto%20is%20not%20the%20sort,religion%2C%20or%20as%20being%20Buddhist&lt;/ref&gt;In fact, Shinto in Japan is often practiced alongside Buddhism; most Japanese do not identify exclusively as Shinto followers&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/faq/#:~:text=Shinto%20is%20not%20the%20sort,religion%2C%20or%20as%20being%20Buddhist&lt;/ref&gt;. This means a non-Japanese person can incorporate Shinto practices (such as honoring kami at a home altar or observing Shinto festivals) into their life even if they belong to another religion. Shinto institutions do not consider this cultural appropriation; they see it as a normal extension of Shinto’s non-exclusive nature.
* '''Non-Japanese Shinto Priests:''' It is even possible for foreigners to become Shinto priests (神職 ''shinshoku''). Jinja Honchō notes that a ''handful'' of non-Japanese individuals have undergone the requisite training and been licensed as priests​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/faq/#:~:text=Yes,the%20practical%20hurdles%20are%20considerable&lt;/ref&gt;The training – typically a year or more of study in Japan, in Japanese – poses high practical hurdles, but there is no ethnic bar to ordination&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/faq/#:~:text=Yes,the%20practical%20hurdles%20are%20considerable&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, for example, an Austrian man named Florian Wiltschko became the first foreigner certified by Jinja Honchō as a Shinto priest, after rigorous training in Tokyo&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/faq/#:~:text=Yes,the%20practical%20hurdles%20are%20considerable&lt;/ref&gt;. Likewise, the Tsubaki Grand Shrine of America (in Washington state) has long been headed by a non-Japanese priest. These cases show that official Shinto organizations can accommodate non-Japanese practitioners even in clergy roles. The underlying stance is that '''sincerity and proper training''', not ethnicity, are what qualify a person to serve the kami (deities).
* '''Shinto Abroad:''' Shinto shrines exist outside Japan in communities of the Japanese diaspora (e.g. in Hawai’i, Brazil, the mainland U.S., Europe, etc.), and they too fall under or cooperate with Jinja Honchō​&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/faq/#:~:text=Yes,as%20one%20in%20San%20Marino&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, such shrines were founded to serve emigrant Japanese communities, but today they often welcome local participants of diverse backgrounds. Jinja Honchō officially recognizes some overseas shrines (for instance, a shrine in San Marino in Europe)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/faq/#:~:text=Yes,as%20one%20in%20San%20Marino&lt;/ref&gt;. This international presence implies an acceptance that '''local, non-Japanese worshippers''' may venerate the kami. In summary, the official policy of Shinto authorities is inclusive: anyone may visit shrines and honor the kami, and one can practice Shinto rituals without being ethnically Japanese. Rather than viewing this as misappropriation, Shinto leaders encourage ''respectful'' participation. They do, however, expect outsiders to '''observe proper decorum''' (e.g. bowing, purity rituals) as a sign of respect toward Shinto traditions&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/faq/#:~:text=There%20are%20no%20specific%20restrictions,a%20polite%20and%20sincere%20manner&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shinto in a Global Context: Scholarship on Globalization, Nationalism, and Spiritual Tourism ==
Academic researchers have been studying the globalization of Shinto and the complexities that arise when a tradition so rooted in Japanese culture spreads to non-Japanese contexts. A key question is how Shinto – often seen as the “indigenous religion” of Japan – transforms when people outside Japan adopt its practices. Scholars of religion have noted both '''opportunities''' and '''tensions''' in this process, often discussing cultural appropriation, nationalism, and the role of tourism and pop culture in popularizing Shinto abroad.

'''Motivations for Non-Japanese Adopting Shinto:''' Recent research by Kaitlyn Ugoretz, who conducts digital ethnography of online Shinto communities, identifies several common “paths” by which non-Japanese become interested in Shinto&lt;ref&gt;https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/journal/3/issue/348/pdf/download#:~:text=or%20plural,world%20are%20interested%20in%20recovering&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/journal/3/issue/348/pdf/download#:~:text=The%20first%20path%20to%20discovering,surveys%20and%20fieldwork%2C%20I%20have&lt;/ref&gt;

list of TLDs: https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db

RFC 952 (modified by RFC 1123) requires the first and last character of a hostname to be a letter or a digit.  Between
the first and last characters the name may use letters, digits, and the hyphen.

Also allowed are IPv4 addresses. IPv6 not supported

domain is expected to be stripped of any path so that the last character in the last character of the TLD.  tld
is two or more alpha characters.  Any preceding '//' (from splitting a URL with a scheme) will be stripped
here.  Perhaps not necessary but retained in case it is necessary for IPv4 dot decimal.

There are several tests:
	the first character of the whole domain name including subdomains must be a letter or a digit
	internationalized domain name (ASCII characters with .xn-- ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) prefix xn-- in the TLD) see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3490
	single-letter/digit second-level domains in the .org, .cash, and .today TLDs

find bracketed URLs are required because the parameters that call this test (currently |title=, |chapter=, |work=,

|script-title= holds title parameters that are not written in Latin-based scripts: Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hebrew, etc. These scripts should
not be italicized and may be written right-to-left.  The value supplied by |script-title= is concatenated onto Title after Title has been wrapped
in italic markup.

Regardless of language, all values provided by |script-title= are wrapped in &lt;bdi&gt;...&lt;/bdi&gt; tags to isolate RTL languages from the English left to right.

|script-title= provides a unique feature.  The value in |script-title= may be prefixed with a two-character ISO 639-1 language code and a colon:
	|script-title=ja:*** *** (where * represents a Japanese character)
Spaces between the two-character code and the colon and the colon and the first script character are allowed:
	|script-title=ja : *** ***
	|script-title=ja: *** ***
	|script-title=ja :*** ***
Spaces preceding the prefix are allowed: |script-title = ja:*** ***

The prefix is checked for validity.  If it is a valid ISO 639-1 language code, the lang attribute (lang="ja") is added to the &lt;bdi&gt; tag so that browsers can
know the language the tag contains.  This may help the browser render the script more correctly.  If the prefix is invalid, the lang attribute
is not added.  At this time there is no error message for this condition.

For Vancouver style, author/editor names are supposed to be rendered in Latin
(read ASCII) characters.  When a name uses characters that contain diacritical
marks, those characters are to be converted to the corresponding Latin
character. When a name is written using a non-Latin alphabet or logogram, that
name is to be transliterated into Latin characters. The module doesn't do this
so editors may/must.

This test allows |first= and |last= names to contain any of the letters defined
in the four Unicode Latin character sets

	or nil == mw.ustring.find (first, "^[A-Za-zÀ-ÖØ-öø-ƿǄ-ɏ%-%s%'%.]+[2-6%a]*$") then
was written outside of the code editor and pasted here because the code editor
gets confused between character insertion point and cursor position. The test has
been rewritten to use decimal character escape sequence for the individual bytes
of the Unicode characters so that it is not necessary to use an external editor
to maintain this code.

Compares values assigned to various parameters according to the string provided as &lt;item&gt; in the function call.
&lt;item&gt; can have on of two values:
	'generic_names' – for name-holding parameters: |last=, |first=, |editor-last=, etc
	'generic_titles' – for |title=

There are two types of generic tests.  The 'accept' tests look for a pattern that should not be rejected by the
'reject' test.  For example,
	|author=[[John Smith (author)|Smith, John]]
would be rejected by the 'author' reject test.  But piped wikilinks with 'author' disambiguation should not be
rejected so the 'accept' test prevents that from happening.  Accept tests are always performed before reject
tests.

Each of the 'accept' and 'reject' sequence tables hold tables for en.wiki (['en']) and local.wiki (['local'])
that each can hold a test sequence table  The sequence table holds, at index [1], a test pattern, and, at index
[2], a boolean control value.  The control value tells string.find() or mw.ustring.find() to do plain-text search (true)
or a pattern search (false).  The intent of all this complexity is to make these searches as fast as possible so
that we don't run out of processing time on very large articles.

Returns
	true when a reject test finds the pattern or string
	false when an accept test finds the pattern or string
	nil else

Gets name list from the input arguments

Searches through args in sequential order to find |lastn= and |firstn= parameters
(or their aliases), and their matching link and mask parameters. Stops searching
when both |lastn= and |firstn= are not found in args after two sequential attempts:
found |last1=, |last2=, and |last3= but doesn't find |last4= and |last5= then the
search is done.

This function emits an error message when there is a |firstn= without a matching
|lastn=.  When there are 'holes' in the list of last names, |last1= and |last3=
are present but |last2= is missing, an error message is emitted. |lastn= is not
required to have a matching |firstn=.

When an author or editor parameter contains some form of 'et al.', the 'et al.'
is stripped from the parameter and a flag (etal) returned that will cause list_people()
to add the static 'et al.' text from Module:Citation/CS1/Configuration.  This keeps
'et al.' out of the template's metadata.  When this occurs, an error is emitted.

Gets language name from a provided two- or three-character ISO 639 code.  If a code
is recognized by MediaWiki, use the returned name; if not, then use the value that
was provided with the language parameter.

When |language= contains a recognized language (either code or name), the page is
assigned to the category for that code: Category:Norwegian-language sources (no).
For valid three-character code languages, the page is assigned to the single category
for '639-2' codes: Category:CS1 ISO 639-2 language sources.

Languages that are the same as the local wiki are not categorized.  MediaWiki does
not recognize three-character equivalents of two-character codes: code 'ar' is
recognized but code 'ara' is not.

This function supports multiple languages in the form |language=nb, French, th
where the language names or codes are separated from each other by commas with
optional space characters.

Returns a number that defines the number of names displayed for author and editor
name lists and a Boolean flag to indicate when et al. should be appended to the name list.

When the value assigned to |display-xxxxors= is a number greater than or equal to zero,
return the number and the previous state of the 'etal' flag (false by default
but may have been set to true if the name list contains some variant of the text 'et al.').

When the value assigned to |display-xxxxors= is the keyword 'etal', return a number
that is one greater than the number of authors in the list and set the 'etal' flag true.
This will cause the list_people() to display all of the names in the name list followed by 'et al.'

In all other cases, returns nil and the previous state of the 'etal' flag.

Check archive.org URLs to make sure they at least look like they are pointing at valid archives and not to the 
save snapshot URL or to calendar pages.  When the archive URL is 'https://web.archive.org/save/' (or http://...)
archive.org saves a snapshot of the target page in the URL.  That is something that Wikipedia should not allow
unwitting readers to do.

When the archive.org URL does not have a complete timestamp, archive.org chooses a snapshot according to its own
algorithm or provides a calendar 'search' result.  [[WP:ELNO]] discourages links to search results.

This function looks at the value assigned to |archive-url= and returns empty strings for |archive-url= and
|archive-date= and an error message when:
	|archive-url= holds an archive.org save command URL
	|archive-url= is an archive.org URL that does not have a complete timestamp (YYYYMMDDhhmmss 14 digits) in the
		correct place
otherwise returns |archive-url= and |archive-date=

There are two mostly compatible archive.org URLs:
	//web.archive.org/&lt;timestamp&gt;...		-- the old form
	//web.archive.org/web/&lt;timestamp&gt;...	-- the new form

The old form does not support or map to the new form when it contains a display flag.  There are four identified flags
('id_', 'js_', 'cs_', 'im_') but since archive.org ignores others following the same form (two letters and an underscore)
we don't check for these specific flags but we do check the form.

This function supports a preview mode.  When the article is rendered in preview mode, this function may return a modified
archive URL:
	for save command errors, return undated wildcard (/*/)
	for timestamp errors when the timestamp has a wildcard, return the URL unmodified
	for timestamp errors when the timestamp does not have a wildcard, return with timestamp limited to six digits plus wildcard (/yyyymm*/)

A secondary function is to return an archive-url timestamp from those urls that have them (archive.org and
archive.today).  The timestamp is used by validation.archive_date_check() to see if the value in |archive-date=
matches the timestamp in the archive url.

Look at the contents of a parameter. If the content has a string of characters and digits followed by an equal
sign, compare the alphanumeric string to the list of cs1|2 parameters.  If found, then the string is possibly a
parameter that is missing its pipe.  There are two tests made:
	{{cite ... |title=Title access-date=2016-03-17}}	-- the first parameter has a value and whitespace separates that value from the missing pipe parameter name
	{{cite ... |title=access-date=2016-03-17}}			-- the first parameter has no value (whitespace after the first = is trimmed by MediaWiki)
cs1|2 shares some parameter names with XML/HTML attributes: class=, title=, etc.  To prevent false positives XML/HTML
tags are removed before the search.

If a missing pipe is detected, this function adds the missing pipe maintenance category.

at en.wiki Greek characters are used as sort keys for certain items in a category so that those items are
placed at the end of a category page.  See Wikipedia:Categorization#Sort_keys.  That works well for en.wiki
because English is written using the Latn script.  This may not work well for other languages.  At en.wiki it
is desireable to place content from certain namespaces at the end of a category listing so the module adds sort
keys to error and maintenance category links when rendering a cs1|2 template on a page in that namespace.

--[[--------------------------&lt; D A T E _ N A M E S &gt;----------------------------------------------------------

This table of tables lists local language date names and fallback English date names.
The code in Date_validation will look first in the local table for valid date names.
If date names are not found in the local table, the code will look in the English table.

Because citations can be copied to the local wiki from en.wiki, the English is
required when the date-name translation function date_name_xlate() is used.

In these tables, season numbering is defined by
Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF) Specification (https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/)
which became part of ISO 8601 in 2019.  See '§Sub-year groupings'. The standard
defines various divisions using numbers 21-41. CS1|2 only supports generic seasons.
EDTF does support the distinction between north and south hemisphere seasons
but CS1|2 has no way to make that distinction.

33-36 = Quarter 1, Quarter 2, Quarter 3, Quarter 4 (3 months each)

The standard does not address 'named' dates so, for the purposes of CS1|2,
Easter and Christmas are defined here as 98 and 99, which should be out of the
ISO 8601 (EDTF) range of uses for a while.

local_date_names_from_mediawiki is a boolean.  When set to:
	true – module will fetch local month names from MediaWiki for both date_names['local']['long'] and date_names['local']['short']; this will unconditionally overwrite manual translations
	false – module will *not* fetch local month names from MediaWiki

Caveat lector:  There is no guarantee that MediaWiki will provide short month names.  At your wiki you can test
the results of the MediaWiki fetch in the debug console with this command (the result is alpha sorted):
	=mw.dumpObject (p.date_names['local'])

While the module can fetch month names from MediaWiki, it cannot fetch the quarter, season, and named date names
from MediaWiki.  Those must be translated manually.

The following contains a list of values for various defined identifiers.  For each
identifier we specify a variety of information necessary to properly render the
identifier in the citation.

	parameters: a list of parameter aliases for this identifier; first in the list is the canonical form
	link: Wikipedia article name
	redirect: a local redirect to a local Wikipedia article name;  at en.wiki, 'ISBN (identifier)' is a redirect to 'International Standard Book Number'
	q: Wikidata q number for the identifier
	label: the label preceding the identifier; label is linked to a Wikipedia article (in this order):
		redirect from id_handlers['&lt;id&gt;'].redirect when use_identifier_redirects is true
		Wikidata-supplied article name for the local wiki from id_handlers['&lt;id&gt;'].q
		local article name from id_handlers['&lt;id&gt;'].link
	prefix: the first part of a URL that will be concatenated with a second part which usually contains the identifier
	suffix: optional third part to be added after the identifier
	encode: true if URI should be percent-encoded; otherwise false
	COinS: identifier link or keyword for use in COinS:
		for identifiers registered at info-uri.info use: info:.... where '...' is the appropriate identifier label 
		for identifiers that have COinS keywords, use the keyword: rft.isbn, rft.issn, rft.eissn
		for |asin= and |ol=, which require assembly, use the keyword: url
		for others make a URL using the value in prefix/suffix and #label, use the keyword: pre (not checked; any text other than 'info', 'rft', or 'url' works here)
		set to nil to leave the identifier out of the COinS
	separator: character or text between label and the identifier in the rendered citation
	id_limit: for those identifiers with established limits, this property holds the upper limit
	access: use this parameter to set the access level for all instances of this identifier.
		the value must be a valid access level for an identifier (see ['id-access'] in this file).
	custom_access: to enable custom access level for an identifier, set this parameter
		to the parameter that should control it (normally 'id-access')

This module is intended to provide access to basic string functions.

Most of the functions provided here can be invoked with named parameters,
unnamed parameters, or a mixture.  If named parameters are used, Mediawiki will
automatically remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the parameter.
Depending on the intended use, it may be advantageous to either preserve or
remove such whitespace.

Global options
    ignore_errors: If set to 'true' or 1, any error condition will result in
        an empty string being returned rather than an error message.

    error_category: If an error occurs, specifies the name of a category to
        include with the error message.  The default category is
        [Category:Errors reported by Module String].

    no_category: If set to 'true' or 1, no category will be added if an error
        is generated.

Unit tests for this module are available at Module:String/tests.

len

This function returns the length of the target string.

Usage:
{{#invoke:String|len|target_string|}}
OR
{{#invoke:String|len|s=target_string}}

Parameters
    s: The string whose length to report

If invoked using named parameters, Mediawiki will automatically remove any leading or
trailing whitespace from the target string.
]]
function str.len( frame )
	local new_args = str._getParameters( frame.args, {'s'} )
	local s = new_args['s'] or ''
	return mw.ustring.len( s )
end

--[[
sub

This function returns a substring of the target string at specified indices.

Usage:
{{#invoke:String|sub|target_string|start_index|end_index}}
OR
{{#invoke:String|sub|s=target_string|i=start_index|j=end_index}}

Parameters
    s: The string to return a subset of
    i: The first index of the substring to return, defaults to 1.
    j: The last index of the string to return, defaults to the last character.

The first character of the string is assigned an index of 1.  If either i or j
is a negative value, it is interpreted the same as selecting a character by
counting from the end of the string.  Hence, a value of -1 is the same as
selecting the last character of the string.

If the requested indices are out of range for the given string, an error is
reported.

_match

This function returns a substring from the source string that matches a
specified pattern. It is exported for use in other modules

Usage:
strmatch = require("Module:String")._match
sresult = strmatch( s, pattern, start, match, plain, nomatch )

Parameters
    s: The string to search
    pattern: The pattern or string to find within the string
    start: The index within the source string to start the search.  The first
        character of the string has index 1.  Defaults to 1.
    match: In some cases it may be possible to make multiple matches on a single
        string.  This specifies which match to return, where the first match is
        match= 1.  If a negative number is specified then a match is returned
        counting from the last match.  Hence match = -1 is the same as requesting
        the last match.  Defaults to 1.
    plain: A flag indicating that the pattern should be understood as plain
        text.  Defaults to false.
    nomatch: If no match is found, output the "nomatch" value rather than an error.

match

This function returns a substring from the source string that matches a
specified pattern.

Usage:
{{#invoke:String|match|source_string|pattern_string|start_index|match_number|plain_flag|nomatch_output}}
OR
{{#invoke:String|match|s=source_string|pattern=pattern_string|start=start_index
    |match=match_number|plain=plain_flag|nomatch=nomatch_output}}

Parameters
    s: The string to search
    pattern: The pattern or string to find within the string
    start: The index within the source string to start the search.  The first
        character of the string has index 1.  Defaults to 1.
    match: In some cases it may be possible to make multiple matches on a single
        string.  This specifies which match to return, where the first match is
        match= 1.  If a negative number is specified then a match is returned
        counting from the last match.  Hence match = -1 is the same as requesting
        the last match.  Defaults to 1.
    plain: A flag indicating that the pattern should be understood as plain
        text.  Defaults to false.
    nomatch: If no match is found, output the "nomatch" value rather than an error.

If invoked using named parameters, Mediawiki will automatically remove any leading or
trailing whitespace from each string.  In some circumstances this is desirable, in
other cases one may want to preserve the whitespace.

If the match_number or start_index are out of range for the string being queried, then
this function generates an error.  An error is also generated if no match is found.
If one adds the parameter ignore_errors=true, then the error will be suppressed and
an empty string will be returned on any failure.

pos

This function returns a single character from the target string at position pos.

Usage:
{{#invoke:String|pos|target_string|index_value}}
OR
{{#invoke:String|pos|target=target_string|pos=index_value}}

Parameters
    target: The string to search
    pos: The index for the character to return

If invoked using named parameters, Mediawiki will automatically remove any leading or
trailing whitespace from the target string.  In some circumstances this is desirable, in
other cases one may want to preserve the whitespace.

The first character has an index value of 1.

If one requests a negative value, this function will select a character by counting backwards
from the end of the string.  In other words pos = -1 is the same as asking for the last character.

A requested value of zero, or a value greater than the length of the string returns an error.

--[[
str_find

This function duplicates the behavior of {{str_find}}, including all of its quirks.
This is provided in order to support existing templates, but is NOT RECOMMENDED for
new code and templates.  New code is recommended to use the "find" function instead.

Returns the first index in "source" that is a match to "target".  Indexing is 1-based,
and the function returns -1 if the "target" string is not present in "source".

Important Note: If the "target" string is empty / missing, this function returns a
value of "1", which is generally unexpected behavior, and must be accounted for
separatetly.

--[[
find

This function allows one to search for a target string or pattern within another
string.

Usage:
{{#invoke:String|find|source_str|target_string|start_index|plain_flag}}
OR
{{#invoke:String|find|source=source_str|target=target_str|start=start_index|plain=plain_flag}}

Parameters
    source: The string to search
    target: The string or pattern to find within source
    start: The index within the source string to start the search, defaults to 1
    plain: Boolean flag indicating that target should be understood as plain
        text and not as a Lua style regular expression, defaults to true

If invoked using named parameters, Mediawiki will automatically remove any leading or
trailing whitespace from the parameter.  In some circumstances this is desirable, in
other cases one may want to preserve the whitespace.

This function returns the first index &gt;= "start" where "target" can be found
within "source".  Indices are 1-based.  If "target" is not found, then this
function returns 0.  If either "source" or "target" are missing / empty, this
function also returns 0.

This function should be safe for UTF-8 strings.

    replace: The replacement text
    count: The number of occurences to replace, defaults to all.

--      This module implements the {{category handler}} template in Lua,      --
--      with a few improvements: all namespaces and all namespace aliases     --
--      are supported, and namespace names are detected automatically for     --
--      the local wiki. This module requires [[Module:Namespace detect]]      --
--      and [[Module:Yesno]] to be available on the local wiki. It can be     --
--      configured for different wikis by altering the values in              --
--      [[Module:Category handler/config]], and pages can be blacklisted      --
--      from categorisation by using [[Module:Category handler/blacklist]].   --
--                                                                            --
