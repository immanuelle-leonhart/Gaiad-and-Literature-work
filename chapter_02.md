This tale you hear is not just woven lore,
But truths divine, a map for every soul.
In Aster’s yarn and Andromeda’s core,
We find the threads that make the cosmos whole.

As you embark, this journey shall reveal,
The path to reunite the love once torn.
Your life, a thread, within this cosmic wheel,
Will help to weave the dawn of their new morn.

Aster, with bow in hand, released a thread,
A string of red that soared through cosmic space,
But in its flight, it faltered, lost ahead,
And failed to reach Andromeda’s embrace.

Andromeda, with bow and string of blue,
She aimed her shot across the starry sea,
But like the red, her thread could not break through,
And fell just short, her love still out of reach.

Triangulum and Magellanic clouds,
They gathered bits of green from space’s weave,
And tied the strings, with careful, gentle shrouds,
Uniting red and blue, a bond to weave.

And so, each day, we gaze up to the sky,
At Sagittarius and the Princess
We hope their union, once again, draws nigh,
When Milkdromeda forms from love endless

The threads we see above, they are our own,
Our destinies in red, in green, in blue,
We weave the fabric where their love is shown,
Together in the sky, our fates accrue.

The Omega point, all will unify,
As Aster and Andromeda break free.
To join at last, in celestial tie,
A final act in cosmic harmony.
