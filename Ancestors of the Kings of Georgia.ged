2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Armenians did not allow Bak'ar to rule, for they wanted to enthrone the son of Trdat's daughter [Salome]. Bak'ar took [62] refuge in Iran, giving the country to them. To P'eroz he gave from Sha
2 CONC mshoylde to the head of Ashots'k'. Similarly he sent protests to Byzantium ("Greece") and mustered troops from all parts. He fought the Armenians in Jawaxet', driving them out. [g69] Then Bak'ar reign
2 CONC ed [Aspacures II/ Varaz-Bakur I, 363-365], through the might of the Byzantines and Iranians. He obtained a document from Salome and her son stating that they would not seek the throne unless Bak'ar's 
2 CONC line was extinguished. He gave them Kuxet' and set him up as prince of Risha. He himself remained firm in the faith and converted many of the Caucasians to Christianity. He built a church at Tsilkan a
2 CONC nd increased the clergy and deacons. He died in peace and was buried near his brother. Then his son, Mirdat [Mithridates/Mihrdat III, 365-380, diarch 370-378], ruled.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Yohannes, Yakob became bishop, and after him the kat'oghikos of Armenia, Nerses, ordained his own deacon, Yakob, as bishop of Iberia and sent him there. King Mihrdat, a man who believed in Go
2 CONC d, was a builder and embellisher of churches. In his day they started to take fragments from the column which we mentioned earlier, and the king did not stop this. Mihrdat died and his son Varzabak'ar
2 CONC  [Aspacures III/ Varaz-Bakur II, 380-394] ruled. The latter had two wives: the daughter of Rev [II], who bore him Mihrdat and Trdat; and the granddaughter of P'eroz [of Gugark'], [63] [g70] who bore h
2 CONC im P'arsman. Varaz-Bakur, an evil man lacking in faith, did nothing worthy of recall. Now in his day [and] in the time of the king of Armenia, brave Trdat's son Xosrov, the military commander of Iran 
2 CONC came to the borders of Armenia and Iberia and demanded taxes from them. Xosrov ordered the Iberian king to send inhabitants of Caucasus, Leks and Ossetians, to fight the Iranians. But that coward Vara
2 CONC z-Bakur, filled with fear, hid himself in the valley of Kuxet'. The Iranians came and built a fortress opposite Mts'xet'a at the gate of Tiflis. When the Iberians sought peace, [the Iranian commander]
2 CONC  demanded Aghbania and Movkan, "for it is Iranian," he said, "and K'art'li where you were born should be sufficient for you, sons of a maid-servant; furthermore, you must pay taxes to the Xosrovunik."
2 CONC  Which is in fact what [the Iberians] did, abandoning Aghbania and Movkan to the Iranians and becoming tributary. The Iranian army departed. In the same period the Byzantines raided, capturing T'oxark
2 CONC ' and Klarjk', from the sea to Arsion. Only K'art'li, Heret' and Egris remained under Varaz-Bakur. After a short time he died, leaving small boys [as heirs]. [g71] The princes enthroned Trdat [Tiridat
2 CONC es, 394-406], Trdat the Great's daughter's son, from the land of the Armenian king. He was a good, devout, and wise man who put an end to the Iranian assaults, built churches, and increased all spirit
2 CONC ual and physical benefits. He freed Risha and built a church there. After the [64] repose of bishop Yakob, he appointed Eghia in his place. He built Nekaria, and then died leaving a good name. Then P'
2 CONC arsman [II, Pharasmanes II, 406-409] reigned. Finding aid from the emperor he resisted Iran; however, he died after a short while. Then Rev's grandson Mihrdat [IV, Mithridates IV, 409-411] ruled, an i
2 CONC nsolent, senseless man who did not pay taxes to Iran. So the Iranian king dispatched the commander Up'rib against them. Mihrdat went against them in Gardaban, was seized by them and the troops were be
2 CONC aten. The Iranians entered K'art'li, pulled down the churches, and established fire-temples everywhere.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Now after three years, when the Iranians were occupied fighting their enemies in the East, the Iberians lifted their heads and enthroned Mihrdat's son Arch'il as their king [A.D. 411-435]. He did a
2 CONC way with the fire-temples in the land, taking refuge in the holy Cross. They expelled the Iranians and warred against them with Byzantine aid. Consequently the Iranian lieutenant in charge of Aghbania
2 CONC , Movkan, and Atrpatakan [g72] came against [Arch'il] with a great force. But Arch'il, also taking along a great force, went before him to Berdahoj and expelled them through the power of the holy Cros
2 CONC s. Entering Aghbania, he captured them and returned with great delight. He sent messengers to the entire country, saying: "It was [65] not through our strength or wisdom that we vanquished the Iranian
2 CONC s, but in the name of the blessed Trinity and by the might of the Cross of Christ our God. Now be firm in the faith and glorify God the great." When all heard this they blessed the holy Trinity in Its
2 CONC  glory, and renovated the churches. Now since the Iranian king was warring with India, the Sindians, and Ethiopia, he was unable to [fight] Iberia. Arch'il's son, Mihrdat, a brave and successful [warr
2 CONC ior] destroyed and demolished the Iranian regions, but was unable to capture fortresses or cities. The military commander of Aghbania, Barzabot', gave his daughter in marriage to Mihrdat, and so they 
2 CONC made peace between them. Arch'il gave Shamshoylte and its entire theme to his son. And Mihrdat's wife believed in Christ and was baptised. Her name was Sakduxt, and she built the [church] of st. Sion 
2 CONC in Shamshoylte.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As for the episcopacy, after Eghia it was held by Yunan, followed by Grigor, Barsegh and then Mushid, who was an Iranian. The latter was insufficiently pious of the Lord; quite the contrary, he sec
2 CONC retly held magianism. He neither preached nor encouraged the people to piety, but rather wrote books on the study of magian doctrine. Arch'il and his son were unable to find out about [his leaning] bu
2 CONC t subsequently the bishop Mik'ayel discovered and wrote about it.[66]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Arch'il piously reposed in Christ, and his son Mirdat [Mithridates/Mihrdat V, 435-447] ruled, a virtuous man like his father. He had a daughter, named Xorandze, [g73] yet they requested a male chil
2 CONC d from the Lord. After four years a son was born to him who was named Varazxosrovt'ang in Iranian, or Vaxt'ang in Georgian. They rejoiced exceedingly, gave to the poor, and thanked God. The lad grew a
2 CONC nd the spayapet Sayurmak nourished him. Mihrdat died when Vaxt'ang was but seven years old. The child's mother Sakduxt was terrified that her father would try to avenge her apostasy from magianism and
2 CONC  the destruction done to Iran by her husband, Mihrdat. So she gave up the boy and went to her father, beseeching him to forgive her for what had happened. And Barzabat' said to her: "All the damage do
2 CONC ne is forgiven you. But now return to your home, and I shall implant the Iranian faith in Iberia and I shall secure things so that [people] may willingly choose what pleases them, either our [faith] o
2 CONC r the Iberian." He immediately dispatched a fire-attendant to Mts'xet'a and a chief priest, named Bink'aran. They came and resided in Mogt'a. Then Sakduxt ruled the realm according to her father's wil
2 CONC l until he died. His son, Varaz-Bakur, Sakduxt's brother, took his place. The spayapet Sayurmak also died and his position was taken by Jewansher. Now the chief-priest [67] tried to convert Iberia to 
2 CONC his own faith. But no one paid attention to him, excepting a few insignificant people who ruined their own lives. In this period bishop Mushid died and his place was taken by Mik'ayel who was from the
2 CONC  Byzantines and who, by his diligence, kept prominent people in the true faith.[g74]

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aspacures II (or Varaz-Bakur I, Georgian: ვარაზ-ბაკურ I), of the Chosroid Dynasty, was the king of Iberia (Kartli, eastern Georgia) from c. 363 to 365. He was the second son of 
2 CONC Mirian III of Iberia and Nana of Iberia.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His name, recorded by the contemporaneous historian Ammianus Marcellinus (XXVII 12. 16), is evidently a Latinized rendition of Varaz-Bakur or Varaz-Bakar of the later, early medieval, Georgian chro
2 CONC nicles. According to Ammianus, Aspacures was made king of Iberia by the Sassanid King Shapur II after the overthrow of his nephew Sauromaces. His being described as "an impious man and a hater of the 
2 CONC faith" by the Georgian chronicler Leonti Mroveli is significant in this regard: the term implied at that time Zoroastrianism religious sympathies; and connote also his pro-Iranian political orientatio
2 CONC n. Leonti, indeed, then goes on to tell us of his becoming a Sassanid vassal.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At that time Iran was ruled by K'arse-Sharvan [Artashir, c.221-241], son of Sasan, who did away with the Arshakunis, presently called Biwroyk'. Xosrov, king of Armenia, fought with him aided by Asp
2 CONC aragur [Aspacures/Asp'agur I, 265-84] who sent the Lexs, Leks, Ossetians and Khazars via the Caucasus Gate to great king Xosrov. [Xosrov] entered Iran with a motley band, struck the Iranian army, and 
2 CONC put the king of Iran, Karseshar--Artashir himself--to flight. Following this, Artashir consulted with his grandees regarding what they should do about the Armenian king who had harassed them for ten y
2 CONC ears. Then a certain relation of Xosrov's, named Anak, came forward and said in the presence of everyone: "You should serve Xosrov by paying taxes, to preserve the Iranians from his evil." [g39] Secre
2 CONC tly approaching [Artashir's] ear, he said: "I shall go to him [filled] with family affection, as someone having rebelled from you, and I shall slay him treacherously." Which is just what he did. [Anak
2 CONC ] came to [Xosrov] together with his brother, and at the onset of the following year he killed him during a hunt. [Anak] then wanted to escape to Iran, but he and all his people died, excepting two bo
2 CONC ys whom their dayeaks took and ran off with--one fleeing to the Byzantine area, and one to Iran.
2 CONT <p>[32]When the king of Iran heard about this, he came to Mts'xet'a ... [lines missing]. He swore an oath to them and enthroned the five year old lad Mihran [Meribanes/Mirian III, 284-361], and design
2 CONC ated his dayeak Mirvanos [Mirvanoz] [g40] as district-chief and the boy's nourisher. [Artashir] left with him 40,000 select Iranian cavalry and stated that 5,000 of them should remain with the king wh
2 CONC ile the rest should camp in Heret' and fight the Khazars. [Furthermore he said] that his son should worship fire as well as the idols of Iberia, since the Iberians had requested that they not be remov
2 CONC ed from their religion. "For," they said, "it is better that we die than abandon the precepts of our fathers." The Iranian king arose and went to his own land via the base of [mt.] Caucasus, capturing
2 CONC  the mountain valley. Now Mirian, who had grown up and reached manhood, loved the Iberians. He used their language and worshipped the five images near the fire-temple. In his fifteenth year, his wife 
2 CONC died, so they brought him a woman from Pontus, Anna [Nana], daughter of Ulitos [?Olympus]. Mirian was always fighting the Khazars, because the latter were trying to take Darband, to open that gate and
2 CONC  descend on Iran. But Mirian did not allow them to do so.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the fortieth year of [Mirian's] reign, his father [33] Artashir died and his younger brother, Bartam, reigned. When Mirian heard this he went to Baghdad with a multitude of troops and he himself
2 CONC  attempted to take the Iranian kingdom, as the senior brother, "Because," he said, "I am abroad, [g41] and uneasy because of fighting the Khazars, to prevent them from crossing over into Iran." But hi
2 CONC s brother insulted him as the son of a concubine, and said that it was fitting that he himself should have the kingdom since his father had placed the crown on his head with his own hands and had esta
2 CONC blished him on the throne in writing. Then he gave to Mirian Jozret' and half of Syria, Atrpatakan, Armenia, Movkan and Heret' and confirmed that which he had held previously. Mirian turned to the Oss
2 CONC etian area and conquered [the people] for he had heard that they were raiding Iberia (knowing that it was a passageway to Iran). Mirian reached as far as Xazaret' [i.e., to the Khazars] turned through
2 CONC  the Dualet' region and came to Mts'xet'a. After this the Khazars invaded Darband and Mirian went against them and was occupied for many days.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At that time Xosrov's son, Trdates, demonstrated great valor in Greece. There he had seized the king of the Goths who had been harassing the Greeks. As a result of this he [34] was crowned by them,
2 CONC  returned to his patrimony, and killed all the foreign troops he found there [including] Mirian's forces. Now Mirian brought to his aid his relative Peroz, giving him his daughter in marriage so that 
2 CONC he might have [more] power, since a grave threat had come to Iberian land and to all Iran. In those days Mirian's third brother ruled in Iran. He sent [a messaqe] to Mirian that he should take his tro
2 CONC ops and go aqainst Armenia and Greece. He went before him with all his strength and crushed a great host, beyond calculation. They entered Armenia and took many captives, for Trdat was unable to chall
2 CONC enge them because of their multitude. [g42] Instead, he remained in the land's fortified places. Taking the Armenians with them, they crossed over to the land of Greece, demolishing, killing and plund
2 CONC ering without a care. There [the Byzantine] king, Constantine (Kostandianos), was unable to fight with them and was in a great crisis. Then a vision in a dream informed him that if he would worship Go
2 CONC d Who was crucified, he would vanquish their incalculable army by the power of the Cross. He so moved. Having the sign of the Cross as a guide, he came against them, struck them through the might of C
2 CONC hrist, killing with the sword until only very few survivors [remained, who] escaped by a hairsbreadth to the kings of Iran and Iberia. Mirian then entered the stronghold of Mts'xet'a. [35] Knowing tha
2 CONC t all the select [warriors] of Iberia and Iran had been lost, he felt deep sorrow, and was perturbed. Coming to his senses, he sent envoys to Constantine the Great requesting peace from him so that he
2 CONC  would serve him. Similarly he dispatched [envoys] to Trdates the Great. They heeded him and made peace. Constantine took Mirian's son, Bahk'ar [Bak'ar/Bakur], as a hostage. Trdat gave his daughter, S
2 CONC oghome, to Mirian's son, named Rev, and resided at Och'ormi. [g43]

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mirian III (Georgian: მირიან III) was a king of Iberia or Kartli (Georgia), contemporaneous to the Roman emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337). He was the founder of the royal Ch

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to the early medieval Georgian annals and hagiography, Mirian was the first Christian king of Iberia, converted through the ministry of Nino, a Cappadocian female missionary. After Christ
2 CONC ianization of Iberia he is credited with establishment of Christianity as his kingdom's state religion and is regarded by the Georgian Orthodox Church as saint and is canonized as Saint Equal to the A

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Traditional chronology after Prince Vakhushti assigns to Mirian's reign—taken to have lasted for 77 years—the dates 268–345, which Professor Cyril Toumanoff corrects to 284–361. He is also

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antonia Tryphaena also known as Tryphaena of Thrace or Tryphaena (her name in Greek: η Άντωνία Τρύφαινα or Τρυφαίνη, 10 BC - 55) was a Princess of the Bosporan, Pontus, Cili
2 CONC cia, Cappadocia and a Roman Client Queen of Thrace.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Origins, family and early life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tryphaena was the only known daughter and the youngest child of Roman client rulers Polemon Pythodoros and Pythodorida of Pontus. Her elder brothers were Zenon, also known as Artaxias III, who beca
2 CONC me Roman king of Armenia and Polemon II of Pontus, who would succeed her mother and became the last client ruler of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>She was of Anatolian Greek and Roman heritage. Her paternal grandfather was Zenon, a prominent orator and aristocrat, who had been an ally to Mark Antony. Her maternal grandparents were the wealthy
2 CONC  Greek friend of the late Roman Triumvir Pompey Pythodoros of Tralles, and Antonia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Through her maternal grandmother she was a direct descendant of Mark Antony and his second wife Antonia Hybrida Minor. Antony and Antonia were first paternal cousins. Her name reflects her descent 
2 CONC from the triumvir. She was Antony’s third great grandchild and his first great granddaughter. The only other female descendant of Antony‘s, who bears the name ‘Antonia’, is Claudia Antonia, a 
2 CONC Roman princess and the first daughter of Roman Emperor Claudius. Her second name Tryphaena is a name of ancient Greek origin and this name was associated with the Greek Queens and Princesses of the Pt
2 CONC olemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt. Tryphaena wasn’t a blood relative of the Ptolemaic dynasty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Through Antony, her great maternal aunt was Roman Client Queen Cleopatra Selene II of Mauretania. Through Antony, she was a distant cousin to Roman Client King Ptolemy of Mauretania and the princes
2 CONC ses named Drusilla of Mauretania. Through Antony, she was a distant cousin to Roman Emperors Caligula, Claudius and Nero and Roman Empresses Valeria Messalina, Agrippina the Younger and Claudia Octavi
2 CONC a.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tryphaena’s father died in 8 BC. Her mother married Roman Client King Archelaus of Cappadocia. Her family moved to Cappadocia and along with her brothers were raised in the court of their stepfat
2 CONC her. Archelaus died in 17. After his death, her mother and Polemon II moved back to Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Queen of Thrace'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Before 12 CE, Tryphaena married Thracian Prince Cotys VIII. Cotys was the son and heir of loyal Roman Client Rulers Rhoemetalces I and Pythodoris I. In 12 Rhoemetalces I died, which is when Tryphae
2 CONC na became queen of Thrace.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Only two ancient sources make reference to her: the historian Tacitus and Strabo the Geographer. Tacitus refers to her as Cotys’ widow and Strabo refers to her as the unnamed daughter of Polemon 
2 CONC Pythodoros and the wife of Cotys. The Greek geographer Strabo was a friend to her mother.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>We also know of Tryphaena from numismatic evidence, inscriptions and buildings she ordered to be commissioned. On surviving coinage, her royal title is '''ΒΑΣΙΛΙΣΣΗΣ ΤΡΥΦΑΙΝΗΣ'''
2 CONC  or of '''Queen Tryphaena'''. In the ancient Greek city of Cyzicus (now in modern Turkey) which became second her residence, Tryphaena and her children have left a number of inscriptions in Cyzicus. S
2 CONC ome of these inscriptions mention her and reveal her descent, for example:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Άντωνία Τρύφαινα Βασιλέως Πολέμωνος καί Βα[σιλίσ]σης Πυθοδωρίδος Θυγάτηρ'''</p>
2 CONT <p>'''Antonia Tryphaena, daughter of King Polemon and of Queen Pythodoris'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Augustus in 14, Tryphaena ordered and financially commissioned at her expense the restoration of Cyzicus. The city’s restoration included works completed on its harbors and can
2 CONC als. She did this as a thanks offering to the memory of Augustus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sometime after the Cyzicus’ restorations were completed, Rhescuporis II, wanted to claim Cotys’ section of the Thracian Kingdom for himself to rule as one kingdom. Cotys refused to give in the 
2 CONC demands of his uncle. The political disagreement between Rhescuporis and Cotys, led Cotys to be captured and killed by his paternal uncle. After the murder of Cotys, Tryphaena fled with her family to 
2 CONC Cyzicus in 18.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Roman Emperor Tiberius in 18 had opened a murder investigation into Cotys’ death. Tiberius put Rhescuporis II on trial in the Roman Senate and invited Tryphaena to attend the trial. During the tr
2 CONC ial Tryphaena accused Rhescuporis II of killing her husband and forcing him to exile himself from his own kingdom. Tiberius found Rhescuporis II guilty and sent him to live in exile in Alexandria, Egy
2 CONC pt. On his way to Egypt Rhescuporis II tried to escape and was killed by Roman soldiers.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tiberius returned the whole Thracian Kingdom to Tryphaena and Tiberius appointed Tryphaena and Cotys’ first child Rhoemetalces II to rule with his mother. The son of Rhescuporis II, Rhoemetalces 
2 CONC III was spared by Tiberius and allowed him to return to Thrace.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tryphaena bore Cotys four known children:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>* A son, Rhoemetalces II, he was named after his paternal grandfather and ruled with Tryphaena from when his father died in 18 until his death in 38.</p>
2 CONT <p>* A daughter, Gepaepyris, she married the Roman Client King Tiberius Julius Aspurgus of the Bosporan Kingdom.</p>
2 CONT <p>* A son, Cotys IX, he was the namesake of his father. He became Roman Client King of Lesser Armenia from 38 to until at least 47.</p>
2 CONT <p>* A daughter, Pythodoris II or Pythodorida II. She was named after her maternal grandparents and her paternal grandmother. In 38, after the death of Rhoemetalces II, Tryphaena abdicated the throne 
2 CONC at the request of Roman Emperor Caligula. Pythodoris II married her second paternal cousin Rhoemetalces III and they ruled Thrace as Roman Client Rulers from 38 until 46.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>While Tryphaena’s children were growing up they were part of the remarkable court of Antonia Minor in Rome. Antonia Minor was another great maternal aunt of Tryphaena’s. Antonia Minor was a ver
2 CONC y influential woman and supervised her circle of various princes and princesses. Her circle assisted in the political preservation of the Roman Empire’s borders and affairs of the client states.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tryphaena was appointed by Caligula in 38 and served as a priestess in the cult of Julia Drusilla and in 42 was appointed by Claudius to serve as a priestess in the cult of late Roman Empress Livia
2 CONC  Drusilla. From 38 until her death, Tryphaena lived as a private citizen in Cyzicus. In Caligula’s reign, she became the benefactor of Cyzicus and enjoyed Caligula’s patronage. Tryphaena was a pro
2 CONC minent citizen in Cyzicus. Tryphaena was heavy influenced by Livia’s lifestyle. Tryphaena's behavior provided an example to elite women in Anatolia, which was later appreciated by other women in tha
2 CONC t region.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Association with Judaism and Christianity'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tryphaena’s brother Polemon II married the Judean Princess Julia Berenice and through their marriage Polemon converted to Judaism and probably later became a Christian.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Through the preachings of Paul the Apostle, Tryphaena may have converted to Christianity. In Christian literature, the Acts of Paul and Thecla set a Queen Tryphaena, a relative of the emperor, in t
2 CONC he city of Antioch of Pisidia; the Epistle to the Romans 16:12 mentions one Tryphena, sends his greeting and adds ’who works in the Lord’s service’. A later martirology connects her with Iconium
2 CONC . The two characters are likely based on Antonia Tryphaena.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tryphaena of Cyzicus is the patron saint of Cyzicus and she was named in honor of Tryphaena.</p>

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dynamis, named Philoromaios (Greek: Δύναμις Φιλορωμαίος, Dynamis, lover of Rome, c. 67-14 BC), was a Roman client queen of the Bosporan Kingdom during the Roman Republic and the r
2 CONC eign of the first Roman Emperor, Augustus.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dynamis is an ancient Greek name meaning the “powerful one”. She was a monarch of Iranian and Greek Macedonian ancestry. Dynamis was the daughter of King Pharnaces II of Pontus and his Sarmatia
2 CONC n wife. She had an older brother called Darius and a younger brother called Arsaces. Her paternal grandparents were the Pontic monarchs Mithridates VI of Pontus and his first wife Laodice, who was als
2 CONC o his sister. Dynamis was born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontus and the Bosporan Kingdom. By 47 BC, Pharnaces II arranged for Dynamis to marry a local nobleman called Asander. This was Asander’s 
2 CONC second marriage but Dynamis’ first.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 47 BC, Asander revolted against Pharnaces II, who had appointed him as regent of the Bosporan Kingdom during the war against the Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus. Asander hoped that by des
2 CONC erting and betraying Pharnaces II, he would win favour with the Romans and they could help him become King of the Bosporus. Pharnaces II was defeated by the Romans and fled with some supporters. Asand
2 CONC er found Pharnaces II and his supporters and put them to death. Asander and Dynamis thus became the monarchs of the Bosporan Kingdom.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Matters remained as such until the Roman dictator Gaius Julius Caesar commanded a paternal uncle of Dynamis, Mithridates II, to declare war on the Bosporan Kingdom and claim the kingship for himsel
2 CONC f. Asander and Dynamis were defeated and exiled by Mithridates II. During their time in exile, Dynamis and Asander were sheltered by her mother’s Sarmatian tribe. After the death of Julius Caesar in
2 CONC  44 BC, the Bosporan Kingdom was restored to Asander and Dynamis by Julius Caesar’s great-nephew and heir, Caesar Octavian (future Roman Emperor Augustus). Dynamis bore Asander a son called Aspurgus
2 CONC . Asander and Dynamis may have had other children as well. From 44 BC until his death in 17 BC, Asander and Dynamis reigned over the Kingdom of the Bosporus. In 17 BC, an obscure Roman usurper called 
2 CONC Scribonius headed a rebellion in the Bosporus, claiming to be a relative of the legitimate ruler Dynamis. When Asander saw his troops desert him for Scribonius, he starved himself to death in despair.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Scribonius pretended to be Dynamis’ relative so that he could seize Asander’s throne. Scribonius won Dynamis over, whether by force or by persuasion, and married her. When Augustus learned of t
2 CONC he rebellion in the Bosporus, Augustus sent the Roman statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa to intervene. Agrippa arrived with his legions, discovered Scribonius’ treachery, and had him put to death. A
2 CONC fter Scribonius’ death, Dynamis became the sole ruler of the Bosporus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dynamis in order to preserve protect the Bosporan Kingdom; to protect her sovereignty and her son’s future, married Roman Client King Polemon I of Pontus. This was Polemon I’s first marriage an
2 CONC d had no children and this marriage for Dynamis was her second marriage. Agrippa asked and appointed Polemon I to become the new Bosporan King. For Dynamis and Polemon I to be married, Agrippa gain Au
2 CONC gustus’ permission and approval for this political alliance to occur.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The marriage that occurred between Dynamis and Polemon I appealed to Augustus, because this marriage showed Dynamis and Polemon I’s allegiances to Augustus and Rome as allies; as ruling client mo
2 CONC narchs and as two broad client states becoming as one state. This union unfortunately, didn’t last as Dynamis died in 14 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Dynamis’ death, Polemon I married Pythodorida of Pontus and had two sons and a daughter with her. Polemon I extended the kingdom to the river Tanais. Polemon I died in 8 BC, and his stepson
2 CONC  Aspurgus succeeded him as king. Pythodorida of Pontus became the sole ruler of Cilicia, Pontus and Colchis.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Character, honors and allegiances'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dynamis is noted as a queen of independent spirit and who reigned long and effectively over the Kingdom of the Bosporus while under Roman suzerainty. Although she was a politically astute ruler, at
2 CONC  times Dynamis was not an easy character.[citation needed] On surviving coins from her reign, Dynamis’ royal title is in Greek ΒΑΣΙΛΙΣΣΗΣ ΔΥΝΑΜΕΩΣ ‘of Queen Dynamis’. Dynamis d
2 CONC edicated a gravestone to a Sarmatian man called Matian, the son of Zaidar. The gravestone depicts a horseman with a bow and quiver.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During earthworks in Kerch in February 1957, a surviving Greek inscription was found that belonged to Dynamis. In this inscription Dynamis, honors her royal Pontic ancestry:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Ύπὲρ βασιλίσσης Δυνάμεως φιλορωμαίου, τῇς ὲκ βασιλέως μεγάλου Φαρνάκου, τοῦ ὲκ βασιλέως Μιθραδάτου Ευπ
2 CONC τρος…</p>
2 CONT <p>For [ruling] Queen Dynamis Philoromaios, [the daughter] of King Pharnaces the Great, [son] of King Mithridates Eupator...''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dynamis obtained recognition as a "friend and ally" of Rome. During her reign, she had erected three statues dedicated to herself and had another statue erected in honor of Augustus’ wife, the fi
2 CONC rst Roman Empress Livia Drusilla. In Phanagoria, Dynamis dedicated an inscription honoring Augustus as :
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''The emperor, Caesar, son of god, the god Augustus, the overseer of every land and sea''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In another inscription, Dynamis calls herself an empress and friend of Rome. This inscription reveals the political ambitions that helped her to maintain her throne. Dynamis dedicated a statue of L
2 CONC ivia in the temple of the ancient Greek goddess Aphrodite. An inscription under Livia’s statue calls Livia the empress and Dynamis’ benefactress. Such inscriptions reveal that Dynamis may have bef
2 CONC riended Livia and August and gotten support from them.

2 CONT <p>Asander named Philocaesar Philoromaios (Greek: Άσανδρoς Φιλοκαισαρ Φιλορώμαίος, Asander, lover of Caesar lover of Rome, 110-17 BC) was an aristocrat and a man of high ra
2 CONC nk of the Bosporan Kingdom.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Asander was of Greek and possibly of Persian ancestry. There is not much is known on his family and early life. He started his political and military career as a general under Pharnaces II, King of
2 CONC  Pontus and the Bosporan. According to some scholars, Asander married as his first wife a woman called Glykareia. She is known from one surviving Greek inscription:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Glykareia, wife of Asander''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By 47 BC, Asander married as his second wife the daughter of Pharnaces II from his Sarmatian wife, Dynamis. She was a granddaughter of King Mithridates VI of Pontus and from his first wife, his sis
2 CONC ter Laodice. In 47 BC, Asander revolted against Pharnaces II, who had appointed him as regent of the Bosporan Kingdom, during the war against General of the Roman Republic, Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus. H
2 CONC e hoped by deserting and betraying his father-in-law, Asander would win favor with the Romans and they could help him become Bosporan King. Pharnaces II was defeated by the Romans. He fled and took re
2 CONC fuge from the Romans with his supporters. Asander found Pharnaces II and put Pharnaces II and his supporters to death.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Asander became Bosporan King and was able to retain the throne with his wife Dynamis as Queen. This was so, until Roman Dictator Gaius Julius Caesar commanded a paternal uncle of Dynamis, Mithridat
2 CONC es II to declare war on the Bosporan Kingdom and claimed the kingship for himself. Asander and Dynamis were defeated by Mithridates II and had gone into political exile. However, after the death of Ju
2 CONC lius Caesar in 44 BC, the Bosporan Kingdom was restored to Asander and Dynamis by Julius Caesar’s great nephew and heir Octavian (future Roman Emperor Augustus). Dynamis bore Asander a son called As
2 CONC purgus. There is a possibility that Asander and Dynamis may have had other children.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to the Greek geographer Strabo, Asander during his reign as King, had constructed a large wall or ditch which was 360 stadia in length across the Isthmus of the Crimea (modern Isthmus of 
2 CONC Perekop). The purpose of the constructed wall was to protect the peninsula against attacks from nomads.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From 44 BC until his death in 17 BC, Asander ruled as a strong king of the Bosporan, although at times, in his reign he had experienced very uneasy times. In 17 BC, Asander died of voluntary starva
2 CONC tion from despair at the age of 93, when he witness his troops desert him to the Roman usurper, Scribonius. Scribonius, pretended to be a relative of Dynamis, so he could seize his throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Dynamis was compelled to marry Scribonius. The Roman statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa discovered the deception of Scribonius, intervened in the situation and appointed Polemon I of Pontus as the 
2 CONC new Bosporan King. Dynamis and Polemon married in 16 BC. Dynamis died in 14 BC. Polemon ruled until his death in 8 BC. Polemon was succeeded by Aspurgus.

2 CONT <p>===Origins & Early Life===</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pythodorida is also known as Pythodoris I and Pantos Pythodorida. According to an honorific inscription dedicated to her in Athens Greece in the late 1st century BC, her royal title was Queen Pytho
2 CONC dorida Philometor (Greek: ΒΑΣΙΛΙΣΣΑ ΠΥΘΟΔΩΡΙΔΑ ΦΙΛΟΜΗΤΩΡ). Philometor means "mother-loving" and this title is associated with the Greek Pharaohs and Queens of the Ptolemaic
2 CONC  dynasty of Ancient Egypt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pythodorida was born and raised in Smyrna (modern İzmir, Turkey). She was the daughter and only child of wealthy Anatolian Greek and friend to the late triumvir Pompey, Pythodoros of Tralles and A
2 CONC ntonia. Pythodorida was half Roman and half Anatolian Greek. She was the namesake of her father.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Her maternal grandparents were the Roman triumvir Mark Antony and Antonia Hybrida Minor, who were paternal first cousins, however Pythodorida’s paternal grandparents are unknown. Pythodorida seem
2 CONC s to the first-born grandchild born to the triumvir Antony.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>===Queen===</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>About 14 BC, Pythodorida married King Polemon Pythodoros of Pontus as his second wife. She became Queen of Pontus and the Bosporan Kingdom when she married Polemon I. Polemon I was previously widow
2 CONC ed by his first wife and had no natural children, except for a stepson.
2 CONT <p>Pythodorida and Polemon had two sons and one daughter, who were:</p>
2 CONT <p>*Zenon, also known as Zeno-Artaxias or Artaxias III, who became King of Armenia in 18 and reigned until his death in 35</p>
2 CONT <p>*Marcus Antonius Polemon Pythodoros, also known as Polemon II of Pontus</p>
2 CONT <p>*Antonia Tryphaena who married King of Thrace, Cotys VIII</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Polemon I died in 8 BC and Pythodorida became the sole Queen of Pontus until her death. Pythodorida was able to retain Colchis and Cilicia but the Bosporan Kingdom, she was unable to retain. The Bo
2 CONC sporan Kingdom, was succeeded by her first husband's stepson Aspurgus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Polemon I died, she married King Archelaus of Cappadocia. Archelaus and Pythodorida had no children. Through her marriages, she became Roman Client Queen of Cappadocia. Pythodorida had moved 
2 CONC with her children from Pontus to Cappadocia to live with Archelaus. When Archelaus died in 17, Cappadocia became a Roman province and she returned with her family back to Pontus. In later years, Polem
2 CONC on II assisted his mother in the administration of the kingdom. When Pythodorida died, Polemon II succeeded her. Pythodorida was a friend and contemporary to the Greek geographer Strabo. Strabo is sai
2 CONC d to have described Pythodorida as a woman of virtuous character. Strabo considered her to have a great capacity for business and considered that under Pythodorida’s rule, Pontus had flourished.

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Polemon Pythodoros, also known as Polemon I or Polemon I of Pontus (Greek: Πολέμων Πυθόδωρος; fl. 1st century BC – died 8 BC) was the Roman Client King of Cilicia, Pontus, Colchis
2 CONC  and the Bosporan Kingdom.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Life and career'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Polemon was the son and heir of Zenon and possibly Tryphaena. He was Anatolian Greek. Polemon’s father, Zenon, was an orator and a prominent aristocrat from Laodicea on the Lycus Anatolia. Zenon 
2 CONC encouraged the locals to resist the Roman General Quintus Labienus and King Pacorus I of Parthia, when their armies invaded Syria and Anatolia. Zenon was a friend and ally to Roman Triumvir Mark Anton
2 CONC y and played a leading role during the Parthian invasion in 40 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>For Zenon’s service to the Parthian Campaign, Antony appointed Polemon in 39 BC, as Roman Client King of Cilicia replacing Darius, son of Pharnaces. In 37 BC after the death of King Arsaces of Po
2 CONC ntus, Antony appointed him as Roman Client King of Pontus. In 36 BC, Polemon assisted Antony in his military campaign against Parthia. The Parthians defeated Antony and Polemon. Polemon was captured a
2 CONC nd taken prisoner by the Parthian King. After a ransom was allowed, Polemon was released. By this time, Polemon was ruling from Iconium (modern Konya) in Lycaonia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 35 BC, Polemon assisted Antony in making an alliance with Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene with Rome, whom the Median King was an ally to Parthia. Both Antony and Polemon, succeeded in this alli
2 CONC ance to happen. During the naval Battle of Actium in 31 BC, Polemon had sent Antony an auxiliary force. Before Actium, Polemon made peace with the triumvir Octavian and became his ally. After the deat
2 CONC h of Antony, Octavian became the Roman emperor Augustus. Augustus early in his reign had acknowledged and recognised Polemon as a Roman Client King and the Client Kingdoms he ruled. Augustus awarded P
2 CONC olemon with an ivory sceptre; an embroidered triumphal robe and he greeted Polemon as king, ally and friend. This recognition was a tradition, which recognises and awards the allies to Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As King of the Bosporan, he extended the Kingdom as far to the river Tanais. Polemon reigned as a long and prosperous king. In 8 BC, Polemon engaged in a military campaign against the Aspurgiani, a
2 CONC  nomad tribe that lived above the mountains of Phanagoria. Polemon was defeated by them, taken as their prisoner and was put to death.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Marriage and succession'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 16 BC the Roman statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, had intervened with the monarchy of the Bosporan Kingdom. Agrippa had discovered, a usurper called Scribonius had pretended be to a relative o
2 CONC f the ruling Queen Dynamis, widow of King Asander. Scribonius wanted to marry Dynamis, so he could rule the Bosporan, however Agrippa discovered his treachery and ordered his death. After Scribonius
2 CONC  death, Agrippa asked Polemon to take Scribonius’ place.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Polemon married Dynamis in 16 BC he left Iconium to rule the Bosporan Kingdom. Through Dynamis Polemon became stepfather to Tiberius Julius Aspurgus, her son from her first marriage. When Dyn
2 CONC amis died in 14 BC Polemon became the sole ruler of the Bosporan.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Later in 14 BC, Polemon married Pythodorida of Pontus as his second wife. She was a noblewoman who was half Anatolian Greek and Roman, and was the first grandchild of Antony. Pythodorida bore Polem

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p>=Pharnaces II of Pontus=</p>
2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pharnaces II of Pontus, also known as Pharnaces II (Greek: Φαρνάκης; about 97-47 BC) was a prince, then King of Pontus and the Bosporan until his death. He was a monarch of Persian and Gree
2 CONC k Macedonian ancestry. Pharnaces II was the youngest son and child born to King Mithridates VI of Pontus from his first wife, his sister Queen Laodice. He was born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontus 
2 CONC and was the namesake of his late paternal great grandfather Pharnaces I of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Coup'''</p>
2 CONT <p>Pharnaces II was raised as his father's successor and treated with distinction. However, we know little of his youth from writers of the time and find him first mentioned after Mithridates VI had t
2 CONC aken refuge from the Roman General Pompey during the Third Mithridatic War.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates VI was keen to wage war with the Romans once more, but Pharnaces was less keen, and thus began a plot to remove his father from power. His plans were discovered, but the army, not wishi
2 CONC ng to engage Pompey and the Roman armies, supported Pharnaces. They marched on Mithridates VI and forced their former king to take his own life in 63 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pharnaces II quickly sent an embassy to Pompey with offers of submission and hostages, for he was keen to secure his position. He also sent the body of his father, to be at the disposal of Pompey. 
2 CONC The latter readily accepted Pharnaces' overtures, for he wished to be back at Rome having been seen to have made peace in the region. Pompey granted Pharnaces the Bosporan Kingdom, and named him frien
2 CONC d and ally of Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Contemporary historians are silent on his early reign, but eventually, on viewing the increasing power struggles between the Romans, and with an eye to recreating the kingdom of his father, he atta
2 CONC cked and subjugated the free Greek city of Phanagoria, violating one of his agreements with Pompey.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''War with Gaius Julius Caesar'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 49 BC, civil war broke out between the two surviving Roman triumvirs Gaius Julius Caesar and Pompey. Whilst the Romans were distracted by this, Pharnaces II decided to seize the opportunity and,
2 CONC  with the forces under his disposal and against little opposition, made himself the ruler of Colchis and Lesser Armenia. The ruler of Galatia, Deiotarus, appealed to Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus, the lieu
2 CONC tenant of Caesar in Asia, for support, and soon the Roman forces sought battle with Pharnaces. They met at Nicopolis in Anatolia, where Pharnaces II defeated the Roman army and overran Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After this show of strength against the Romans, Pharnaces II drew back to suppress revolt in his new conquests. However, the extremely rapid approach of Caesar in person forced Pharnaces to turn hi
2 CONC s attention back to the Romans. At first, recognizing the threat, he made offers of submission, with the sole object of gaining time until Caesar's attention fell elsewhere; but Caesar's speed brought
2 CONC  war quickly, and battle took place near Zela, where Pharnaces was routed and was able to escape with just a small detachment of cavalry. Caesar himself, in a letter to a friend in Rome, said of the s
2 CONC hort war: “Veni, vidi, vici” (“I came, I saw, I conquered”).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pharnaces II fled back to the Bosporan Kingdom, where he managed to assemble a small force of Scythian and Sarmatian troops, with which he was able to gain control of a few cities. His former gover
2 CONC nor and son-in-law Asander, attacked his forces and killed him. The historian Appian states that he died in battle; Cassius Dio says he was captured and then killed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Coinage'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gold and silver coins have survived from his reign dating from 55 BC-50 BC. An example of a coin like this is in the obverse side displays a portrait of Pharnaces II. On the reverse side, displays 
2 CONC the ancient Greek God Apollo semi-draped, seated on a lion-footed throne, holding a laurel branch over a tripod. Apollo’s left elbow is resting on a cithara at his side. On top and between Apollo is
2 CONC  inscribed his royal title in Greek: ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ ΜΕΓΑΛΟΥ ΦΑΡΝΑΚΟΥ, which means of King of Kings Pharnaces the Great.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Marriage, issue and succession'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates VI in the early 1st century BC, made an alliance with the Sarmatian tribes and probably through this alliance Pharnaces possibly sometime after 77 BC married an unnamed Sarmatian noblew
2 CONC oman. She may have been a princess, a relative of a ruling Sarmatian monarch or an influential aristocrat of some stator. His Sarmatian wife bore Pharnaces a son, Darius, a daughter, Dynamis, and a so
2 CONC n, Arsaces. The names that Pharnaces II gave his children are a representation of his Persian and Greek heritage and of his ancestry. His sons were made Pontian kings for a time after his death, by Ro
2 CONC man triumvir Mark Antony. His daughter and her family succeeded him as ruling monarchs of the Bosporan Kingdom. Pharnaces II through his daughter would have further descendants ruling the Bosporan.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Pharnaces II in opera'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The 18th-century librettist Antonio Maria Lucchini crafted a libretto based on incidents from the life of Pharnaces II that was originally set by Antonio Vivaldi in 1727 under the title Farnace. Ba
2 CONC sed on the number of revivals of it that were staged, it must be counted as one of Vivaldi's most successful operas. A few later composers also set Lucchini's libretto, among them Josef Mysliveček, w
2 CONC hose opera Farnace of 1767 was perhaps the best written after Vivaldi's setting. Pharnaces II also appears in Mitridate by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

2 CONT <p>He was raised as his father's successor and treated with distinction. However, we know little of his youth from writers of the time and find him first mentioned after Mithridates had taken refuge f
2 CONC rom the Roman general Pompey during the Third Mithridatic War.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates was keen to wage war with the Romans once more, but his son was less keen, and thus began a plot to remove his father from power. Unfortunately, his plans were discovered, but the army,
2 CONC  not wishing to engage Pompey and the Roman armies, supported Pharnaces. They marched on Mithridates and forced their former king to take his own life.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pharnaces quickly sent an embassy to Pompey with offers of submission and hostages, for he was keen to secure his position. He also sent the body of his father, to be at the disposal of Pompey. The
2 CONC  latter readily accepted Pharnaces overtures, for he wished to be back at Rome having seen to have made peace in the region. Pompey granted Pharnaces the Bosporan Kingdom, and named him friend and all
2 CONC y of Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Contemporary historians are silent on Pharnaces's early reign, but eventually, on viewing the increasing power struggles between the Romans, and with an eye to recreating the kingdom of his father,
2 CONC  he attacked and subjugated the free city of Phanagoria, violating one of his agreements with Pompey.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>War with Caesar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 49 civil war broke out between Julius Caesar and Pompey. Whilst the Romans were distracted by this, Pharnaces decided to seize the opportunity and, with the forces under his disposal and against
2 CONC  little opposition, made himself the ruler of Colchis and lesser Armenia. Deiotarus, the king of Armenia appealed to Domitius Calvinus, the lieutenant of Caesar in Asia, for support, and soon the Roma
2 CONC n forces sought battle with Pharnaces. They met at Nicopolis in Anatolia, and Pharnaces so defeated the Romans that he was easily able to use his army to overwhelm Pontus. He also took the city of Ami
2 CONC sus the late city of Pontus (under his father's rule), sold the inhabitants to slave traders and made all the boys eunuchs.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After this show of strength against the Romans, Pharnaces drew back to suppress revolt in his new conquests. However, the extremely rapid approach of Caesar in person forced Pharnaces to turn his a
2 CONC ttention back to the Romans. At first, recognizing the threat, he made offers of submission, with the sole object of gaining time until Caesars attention fell elsewhere; but Caesar's speed brought war
2 CONC  quickly, and battle took place near Zela (modern Zile in Turkey), where Pharnaces was routed and was able to escape with just a small detachment of cavalry. Caesar himself, in a letter to a friend in
2 CONC  Rome, famously said of the short war “Veni, vidi, vici” (“I came, I saw, I conquered”).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pharnaces himself fled quickly back to the Bosporus, where he managed to assemble a small force of Scythian and Sarmatian troops, with which he was able to gain control of a few cities. However, a 
2 CONC former governor of his, Asandar, attacked his forces and killed him. The historian Appian states that he died in battle; Dio Cassius says he was captured and then killed.

2 CONT <p>Marriage, issue and succession</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pharnaces was about fifty years old when he died, and he had reigned for nearly sixteen years. He had several sons, one of whom, Dareius, Mark Antony made, for a short while, the king of Pontus. Hi

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice (130/129 BC-about 90 BC) was a beautiful Pontian Princess and Queen who was first wife and sister-wife to King Mithridates VI of Pontus.[1]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>She was a monarch of Persian and Greek Macedonian ancestry. Laodice was the second daughter and among the children born to the Pontian Monarchs Laodice VI and Mithridates V of Pontus (reigned 150 B
2 CONC C-120 BC), thus she was born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Her father was assassinated in about 120 BC in Sinope poisoned by unknown persons at a lavish banquet which he held.[2] In the will of her father, Mithridates V left the Kingdom to the joint rule o
2 CONC f her mother and her brothers: Mithridates VI and Mithridates Chrestus. The brothers of Laodice were both under aged to rule and their mother retained all power as regent.[3] Laodice VI’s regency ov
2 CONC er Pontus was from 120 BC-116 BC (even perhaps up to 113 BC). Laodice VI favored Mithridates Chrestus over Mithridates VI. During her mother’s regency, Mithridates VI had escaped from the plotting o
2 CONC f their mother and had gone into hiding.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates VI between 116 BC-113 BC returned to Pontus from hiding and was hailed King. He was able to remove their mother and brother from the Pontian throne, thus Mithridates VI became the sole 
2 CONC ruler of Pontus. Mithridates VI showed clemency towards their mother and brother, by imprisoning them both.[4] Laodice VI died in prison of natural causes, however Mithridates Chrestus could have died
2 CONC  in prison from natural causes or was tried for treason and was executed on his orders.[5] When they died, Mithridates VI gave his mother and brother a royal funeral.[6]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Mithridates VI became the sole ruler of Pontus, Laodice and her brother were practicable strangers. The last time Mithridates VI saw Laodice, she was a little girl in the nursery who was spoil
2 CONC ed. Sometime after Mithridates VI became sole King of Pontus, Mithridates VI had married his sister Laodice. Mithridates VI married Laodice to preserve the purity of their blood-line; as a wife to rul
2 CONC e with him as a sovereign over Pontus; to be the mother of his legitimate children to ensure their succession and to claim his right as a ruling monarch. Through marriage, Laodice became a Queen of Po
2 CONC ntus and Mithridates VI gave her the title of Queen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice bore her brother four sons: Mithridates, Arcathius, Machares, Pharnaces II of Pontus and two daughters: Cleopatra of Pontus and Drypetina (a diminutive form of "Drypetis"). Drypetina was Mi
2 CONC thridates VI’s most devoted daughter. Her baby teeth never fell out, so she had a double set of teeth[7].
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At some point Laodice and Mithridates VI, set about to establish good relations with the citizens of Athens and the Greek island of Delos. Laodice and her brother-husband made benefactions to the A
2 CONC thenians and the Delians. The exact nature of their benefactions and their voluntary donations are unknown. On Delos, honorific statues have survived that have been identified to be of Mithridates VI 
2 CONC and Laodice.[8]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During one time of the absence of Mithridates VI, Laodice began to have affairs with the friends of her brother-husband. Through one of his friends, Laodice became pregnant and gave birth to her so
2 CONC n. To conceal her unfaithfulness to Mithridates VI, Laodice deceived a report of his death and on his return, plotted to have Mithridates VI’s life taken by poison.[9]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At this time Mithridates VI, returned to Pontus without warning and suddenly; and caught Laodice with her lovers. Her brother-husband and his companions were shocked and distressed to see this at S
2 CONC inope. The child that Laodice gave birth too was not his and he had been gone for too long for the child to be his. He hid his rage and embraced Laodice and visited his harem nursery to count his chil
2 CONC dren. Festive banquets were prepared to welcome him back.[10]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Prior to the feast, Mithridates VI’s servants warned him of Laodice’s plots, at the feast and they also named Laodice’s co-conspirators. Feeling betrayed, he cursed his late mother for raisin
2 CONC g such a treacherous daughter, so he had Laodice and her collaborators executed immediately. Laodice’s new born son was spared by Mithridates VI and allowed him to live. After the execution of Laodi
2 CONC ce, Mithridates VI never wanted to marry a Queen by that name which spelt trouble.[11] Laodice’s fate was common knowledge and due to her treachery, Mithridates VI found it very difficult to make an
2 CONC y future wife his official queen.[12]

2 CONT <p>Laodice’s father Mithridates V was aware of the turbulent political situation in Cappadocia, which ended in the death of his sister, Nysa. In the mids 120’s BC, Mithridates V became interested 
2 CONC in Cappadocia and wanted to expand Pontian foreign policy in the country. Mithridates V decided to invade Cappadocia as a foreign country, in order control and overrun Cappadocia.

2 CONT <p>'''Queen consort'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ariarathes VI, in order to beat off any Pontian invasion and to defeat his opponent, arranged with Mithridates V to marry Laodice. There is a possibility that the invasion of Mithridates V was in f
2 CONC act friendly on behalf of Ariarathes VI to settle internal Cappadocian strife and help him to establish himself as a ruler. The marriage that occurred with Ariarathes VI and Laodice marked a cessation
2 CONC  of hostilities between Cappadocia and Pontus. Through this arranged marriage, Mithridates V was able to keep a close check on Ariarathes VI and thus through his daughter was able to control Cappadoci
2 CONC a indirectly and Laodice could act presumably in her father’s interests. Through marriage to her paternal cousin, Laodice became Queen of Cappadocia who wielded considerable power. Laodice bore Aria
2 CONC rathes VI one daughter and two sons: Nysa who married King Nicomedes III Euergetes of Bithynia; Ariarathes VII Philometor and Ariarathes VIII Epiphanes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates V had died in 120 BC and her first brother Mithridates VI had succeeded their father as King of Pontus. Ten years later Laodice may have found it much harder to exert control over Ariar
2 CONC athes VI. There could be a possibility that the Pontian political influence in Cappadocian affairs may have declined, as Ariarathes VI became independent minded and began to assert himself.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A Greek nobleman called Gordius of Cappadocia was a member of the court of Laodice and Ariarathes VI, who was a good friend to Mithridates VI. Laodice’s brother had continued the Pontian foreign 
2 CONC policy in Cappadocia where their father had left off. Mithridates VI had plotted with Gordius to assassinate Ariarathes VI between 116 BC-111 BC. When Mithridates VI and Gordius successful assassinate
2 CONC d Ariarathes VI, there is a possibility Laodice wasn’t involved in the murder of Ariarathes VI.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Regency'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Ariarathes VI, Laodice became a powerful widow and monarch in Cappadocia who acted as a regent for her first young son Ariarathes VII. Laodice’s former son-in-law and widower K
2 CONC ing Nicomedes III Euergetes, wanted to take advantage of the political situation in Cappadocia, so he without informing anyone suddenly invaded Cappadocia with his army as the Cappadocian throne was e
2 CONC mpty after the death of Ariarathes VI.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Nicomedes III invaded Cappadocia, Laodice decided to support him. In order to preserve Cappadocia, her sovereignty and the succession of her sons, Laodice married Nicomedes III and her life wo

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Later life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>With the help of his maternal uncle Ariarathes VII, expelled his mother and her new husband back to Bithynia and was restored to his throne, which at this time was old enough to rule as King. At th

2 CONC  After the death of her second son in 95 BC, Laodice and Nicomedes III attempted to establish an impostor upon the Cappadocian throne as King, claiming he was her third son with Ariarathes VI. They tr

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice (130/129 BC – about 90 BC) was a Pontian Princess and Queen who was first wife and sister-wife to King Mithridates VI of Pontus. She was a monarch of Persian and Greek ancestry.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Early life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice was the second daughter and among the children born to the Pontian Monarchs Laodice VI and Mithridates V of Pontus (reigned 150–120 BC), thus she was born and raised in the Kingdom of Pon
2 CONC tus.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Her father was assassinated in about 120 BC in Sinope poisoned by unknown persons at a lavish banquet which he held. In the will of her father, Mithridates V left the Kingdom to the joint rule of h
2 CONC er mother and her brothers: Mithridates VI and Mithridates Chrestus. The brothers of Laodice were both under aged to rule and their mother retained all power as regent. Laodice VI’s regency over Pon
2 CONC tus was from 120–116 BC (even perhaps up to 113 BC). Laodice VI favored Mithridates Chrestus over Mithridates VI. During her mother’s regency, Mithridates VI had escaped from the plotting of their
2 CONC  mother and had gone into hiding.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates VI between 116–113 BC returned to Pontus from hiding and was hailed King. He was able to remove their mother and brother from the Pontian throne, thus Mithridates VI became the sole r
2 CONC uler of Pontus. Mithridates VI showed clemency towards their mother and brother, by imprisoning them both. Laodice VI died in prison of natural causes, however Mithridates Chrestus could have died in 
2 CONC prison from natural causes or was tried for treason and was executed on his orders. When they died, Mithridates VI gave his mother and brother a royal funeral.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Queen of Pontus'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Mithridates VI became the sole ruler of Pontus, Laodice and her brother were practicable strangers. The last time Mithridates VI saw Laodice, she was a spoiled little girl in the nursery. Some
2 CONC time after Mithridates VI became sole King of Pontus, he married her. This was for several reasons – to preserve the purity of their blood-line; as a wife to rule with him as a sovereign over Pontus
2 CONC ; to be the mother of his legitimate children to ensure their succession and to claim his right as a ruling monarch. Through marriage, Mithridates VI gave Laodice the title of Queen and she became a Q
2 CONC ueen of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice bore her brother four sons: Mithridates, Arcathius, Machares, Pharnaces II of Pontus and two daughters: Cleopatra of Pontus and Drypetina (a diminutive form of "Drypetis"). Drypetina was Mi
2 CONC thridates VI’s most devoted daughter. Her baby teeth never fell out, so she had a double set of teeth.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At some point Laodice and Mithridates VI set about to establish good relations with the citizens of Athens and the Greek island of Delos. Laodice and her brother-husband made benefactions to the At
2 CONC henians and the Delians. The exact nature of their benefactions and their voluntary donations are unknown. On Delos, honorific statues have survived that have been identified to be of Mithridates VI a
2 CONC nd Laodice.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Death'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During one time of Mithridates' absence, Laodice began to have affairs with his friends. Through one of his friends, Laodice became pregnant and gave birth to a son. To conceal her unfaithfulness t
2 CONC o Mithridates VI, Laodice deceived a report of his death and on his return, plotted to have her King poisoned.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However, at this time Mithridates returned to Pontus suddenly and without warning, catching Laodice with her lovers. Her brother-husband and his companions were shocked and distressed to see this a
2 CONC t Sinope. The child that Laodice gave birth to was not his and he had been gone for too long for that to happen. He hid his rage and embraced Laodice and visited his harem nursery to count his childre
2 CONC n. Festive banquets were prepared to welcome him back.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Prior to the feast, Mithridates VI’s servants warned him of Laodice’s plots, at the feast they also named Laodice’s co-conspirators. Feeling betrayed, he cursed his late mother for raising su
2 CONC ch a treacherous daughter, so he had Laodice and her collaborators executed immediately although he spared Laodice’s new born son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the execution of Laodice, Mithridates VI never wanted to marry a Queen by that name which spelt trouble. Laodice’s fate was common knowledge and due to her treachery, Mithridates VI found i
2 CONC t very difficult to make any future wife his official queen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Arts & literature'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>There is a painting on display at the Bibliothèque nationale de France of Laodice and Mithridates. The painting is titled Mithridates poisons Laodice, his wife/sister; Mithridates wins a duel.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In The Grass Crown, the second in the Masters of Rome series, Colleen McCullough, the Australian writer, describes in detail the various aspects of Mithridates VI’s life - the murder of his siste
2 CONC r-wife Laodice, his experiments with poison, and his fear and hatred of Rome. The aging Gaius Marius meets Mithridates in the palace of Ariarathes in Eusebeia Mazaca, a city in Cappadocia, and the for
2 CONC mer Roman Consul, quite alone and surrounded by the Pontic army, orders Mithridates to leave Cappadocia immediately and go back to Pontus - which he does.

2 CONC sidered the greatest ruler of the Kingdom of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Ancestry, family and early life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates VI was a prince of Persian and Greek ancestry. He claimed descent from Cyrus the Great, the family of Darius the Great, the Regent Antipater, the generals of Alexander the Great as well
2 CONC  as the later kings Antigonus I Monophthalmus and Seleucus I Nicator.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates was born in the Pontic city of Sinope, and was raised in the Kingdom of Pontus. He was the first son among the children born to Laodice VI and Mithridates V of Pontus (reigned 150–120
2 CONC  BC). His father, Mithridates V, was a prince and the son of the former Pontic Monarchs Pharnaces I of Pontus and his wife-cousin Nysa. His mother, Laodice VI, was a Seleucid Princess and the daughter
2 CONC  of the Seleucid Monarchs Antiochus IV Epiphanes and his wife-sister Laodice IV.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates V was assassinated in about 120 BC in Sinope, poisoned by unknown persons at a lavish banquet which he held. He left the kingdom to the joint rule of Mithridates' mother, Laodice VI, Mi
2 CONC thridates, and his younger brother, Mithridates Chrestus. Neither Mithridates nor his younger brother were of age, and their mother retained all power as regent for the time being. Laodice VI’s rege
2 CONC ncy over Pontus was from 120 BC to 116 BC (even perhaps up to 113 BC) and favored Mithridates Chrestus over Mithridates. During his mother’s regency, he escaped from his mother's plots against him, 
2 CONC and went into hiding.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates emerged from hiding, returning to Pontus between 116 BC and 113 BC and was hailed as king. He removed his mother and brother from the throne, imprisoning both, becoming the sole ruler o
2 CONC f Pontus. Laodice VI died in prison, ostensibly of natural causes. Mithridates Chrestus may have died in prison also, or may have been tried for treason and executed. Mithridates gave both royal funer
2 CONC als. Mithridates first married his younger sister Laodice, aged 16. His goal was to preserve the purity of their bloodline, solidify his claim to the throne, to co-rule over Pontus, and to ensure the 
2 CONC succession to his legitimate children.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Early reign'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates entertained ambitions of making his state the dominant power in the Black Sea and Anatolia. He first subjugated Colchis, a region east of the Black Sea, and prior to 164 BC, an independ
2 CONC ent kingdom. He then clashed for supremacy on the Pontic steppe with the Scythian King Palacus. The most important centres of Crimea, Tauric Chersonesus and the Bosporan Kingdom readily surrendered th
2 CONC eir independence in return for Mithridates' promises to protect them against the Scythians, their ancient enemies. After several abortive attempts to invade the Crimea, the Scythians and the allied Rh
2 CONC oxolanoi suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Pontic general Diophantus and accepted Mithridates as their overlord. The young king then turned his attention to Anatolia, where Roman power was on 
2 CONC the rise. He contrived to partition Paphlagonia and Galatia with King Nicomedes III of Bithynia. It soon became clear to Mithridates that Nicomedes was steering his country into an anti-Pontic allianc
2 CONC e with the expanding Roman Republic. When Mithridates fell out with Nicomedes over control of Cappadocia, and defeated him in a series of battles, the latter was constrained to openly enlist the assis
2 CONC tance of Rome. The Romans twice interfered in the conflict on behalf of Nicomedes (95–92 BC), leaving Mithridates, should he wish to continue the expansion of his kingdom, with little choice other t
2 CONC han to engage in a future Roman-Pontic war.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Mithridatic Wars'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The next ruler of Bithynia, Nicomedes IV of Bithynia, was a figurehead manipulated by the Romans. Mithridates plotted to overthrow him, but his attempts failed and Nicomedes IV, instigated by his R
2 CONC oman advisors, declared war on Pontus. Rome itself was involved in the Social War, a civil war with its Italian allies. Thus, in all of Roman Asia Province there were only two legions present in Maced
2 CONC onia. These legions combined with Nicomedes IV's army to invade Mithridates' kingdom of Pontus in 89 BC. Mithridates, however, won a decisive victory, scattering the Roman-led forces. His victorious f
2 CONC orces were welcomed throughout Anatolia. The following year, 88 BC, Mithridates orchestrated a massacre of Roman and Italian settlers remaining in several Anatolian cities, essentially wiping out the 
2 CONC Roman presence in the region. This episode is known as the Asiatic Vespers. The Kingdom of Pontus comprised a mixed population in its Ionian Greek and Anatolian cities. The royal family moved the capi
2 CONC tal from Amasya to the Greek city of Sinope. Its rulers tried to fully assimilate the potential of their subjects by showing a Greek face to the Greek world and an Iranian/Anatolian face to the Easter
2 CONC n world. Whenever the gap between the rulers and their Anatolian subjects became greater, they would put emphasis on their Persian origins. In this manner, the royal propaganda claimed heritage both f
2 CONC rom Persian and Greek rulers, including Cyrus the Great, Darius I of Persia, Alexander the Great and Seleucus I Nicator. Mithridates too posed as the champion of Hellenism, but this was mainly to furt
2 CONC her his political ambitions; it is no proof that he felt a mission to promote its extension within his domains. Whatever his true intentions, the Greek cities (including Athens) defected to the side o
2 CONC f Mithridates and welcomed his armies in mainland Greece, while his fleet besieged the Romans at Rhodes. Neighboring King of Armenia Tigranes the Great, established an alliance with Mithridates and ma
2 CONC rried one of Mithridates’ daughters, Cleopatra of Pontus. They would support each other in the coming conflict with Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Romans responded by organising a large invasion force to defeat him and remove him from power.The First Mithridatic War, fought between 88 BC and 84 BC, saw Lucius Cornelius Sulla force Mithrid
2 CONC ates VI out of Greece proper. After victory in several battles, Sulla received news of trouble back in Rome posed by his enemy Gaius Marius and hurriedly concluded peace talks with Mithridates. As Sul
2 CONC la returned to Italy Lucius Licinius Murena was left in charge of Roman forces in Anatolia. The lenient peace treaty, which was never ratified by the Senate, allowed Mithridates VI to recoup his force
2 CONC s. Murena attacked Mithridates in 83 BC, provoking the Second Mithridatic War from 83 BC to 81 BC. Mithridates scored a victory over Murena's green forces before peace was again declared by treaty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Rome attempted to annex Bithynia (bequested to Rome by its last king) nearly a decade later, Mithridates VI attacked with an even larger army, leading to the Third Mithridatic War from 73 BC t
2 CONC o 63 BC. First Lucullus and then Pompey were sent against Mithridates VI, who surged back to retake his kingdom of Pontus, but was at last defeated by Pompey. After Pompey defeated him in Pontus in 66
2 CONC  BC, Mithridates VI fled with a small army to Colchis (modern Georgia) and then over the Caucasus Mountains to Crimea and made plans to raise yet another army to take on the Romans. His eldest living 
2 CONC son, Machares, viceroy of Cimmerian Bosporus, was unwilling to aid his father. Mithridates had Machares killed, and Mithridates took the throne of the Bosporan Kingdom. Mithridates then ordered the co
2 CONC nscriptions and preparations for war. In 63 BC, Pharnaces II of Pontus, one of his sons, led a rebellion against his father, joined by Roman exiles in the core of Mithridates' Pontic army. Mithridates
2 CONC  withdrew to the citadel in Panticapaeum, where he committed suicide. Pompey buried Mithridates in the rock-cut tombs of his ancestors in Amasya, the old capital of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Assassination conspiracy'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the time of the First Mithridatic War, a group of Mithridates' friends plotted to kill him. These were Mynnio and Philotimus of Smyrna, and Cleisthenes and Asclepiodotus of Lesbos. Asclepiod
2 CONC otus changed his mind and became an informant. He arranged to have Mithridates hide under a couch to hear the plot against him. The other conspirators were tortured and executed. However, this was not
2 CONC  enough for Mithridates, who also killed all of the plotters' families and friends.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Propaganda'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Where his ancestors pursued philhellenism as a means of attaining respectability and prestige among the Hellenistic kingdoms, Mithridates VI made use of Hellenism as a political tool. As protector 
2 CONC of Greek cities on the Black Sea and in Asia against barbarism, Mithridates VI logically became protector of Greece and Greek culture, and would use this stance in his clashes with Rome. Strabo mentio
2 CONC ns that Chersonesus buckled under the pressure of the barbarians and asked Mithridates VI to become its protector (7.4.3. c.308). The most impressive symbol of Mithridates VI's approbation with Greece
2 CONC  (Athens in particular) appears at Delos: a heroon dedicated to the Pontic king in 102/1 by the Athenian Helianax, a priest of Poseidon Aisios. A dedication at Delos, by Dicaeus, a priest of Sarapis, 
2 CONC was made in 94/93 BC on behalf of the Athenians, Romans, and "King Mithridates Eupator Dionysus." Greek styles mixed with Persian elements also abound on official Pontic coins – Perseus was favored 
2 CONC as an intermediary between both worlds, East and West. Certainly influenced by Alexander the Great, Mithridates VI extended his propaganda from "defender" of Greece to the "great liberator" of the Gre
2 CONC ek world as war with Roman Republic became inevitable. The Romans were easily translated into "barbarians", in the same sense as the Persian Empire during the war with Persia in the first half of the 
2 CONC 5th century BC and during Alexander's campaign. How many Greeks genuinely bought into this claim will never be known. It served its purpose, however. At least partially because of it, Mithridates VI w
2 CONC as able to fight the First War with Rome on Greek soil, and maintain the allegiance of Greece. His campaign for the allegiance of the Greeks was aided in no small part by his enemy Sulla, who allowed 
2 CONC his troops to sack the city of Delphi and plunder many of the city's most famous treasures to help finance his military expenses.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Death'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After Pompey defeated him in Pontus, Mithridates VI fled to the lands north of the Black Sea in the winter of 66 BCE in the hope that he could raise a new army and carry on the war. However, his pr
2 CONC eparations proved to be too harsh on the local nobles and populace, and they rebelled against his rule. He allegedly attempted suicide by poison; this attempt failed, however, because of his immunity 
2 CONC to the poison. According to Appian's Roman History, he then requested his Gaulish bodyguard and friend, Bituitus, to kill him by the sword:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Mithridates then took out some poison that he always carried next to his sword, and mixed it. There two of his daughters, who were still girls growing up together, named Mithridates and Nysa, who
2 CONC  had been betrothed to the kings of [Ptolemaic] Egypt and of Cyprus, asked him to let them have some of the poison first, and insisted strenuously and prevented him from drinking it until they had tak
2 CONC en some and swallowed it. The drug took effect on them at once; but upon Mithridates, although he walked around rapidly to hasten its action, it had no effect, because he had accustomed himself to oth
2 CONC er drugs by continually trying them as a means of protection against poisoners. These are still called the Mithridatic drugs.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Seeing a certain Bituitus there, an officer of the Gauls, he said to him, "I have profited much from your right arm against my enemies. I shall profit from it most of all if you will kill me, and
2 CONC  save from the danger of being led in a Roman triumph one who has been an autocrat so many years, and the ruler of so great a kingdom, but who is now unable to die by poison because, like a fool, he h

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cassius Dio Roman History, on the other hand, records a different account:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Mithridates had tried to make away with himself, and after first removing his wives and remaining children by poison, he had swallowed all that was left; yet neither by that means nor by the swor
2 CONC d was he able to perish by his own hands. For the poison, although deadly, did not prevail over him, since he had inured his constitution to it, taking precautionary antidotes in large doses every day
2 CONC ; and the force of the sword blow was lessened on account of the weakness of his hand, caused by his age and present misfortunes, and as a result of taking the poison, whatever it was. When, therefore
2 CONC , he failed to take his life through his own efforts and seemed to linger beyond the proper time, those whom he had sent against his son fell upon him and hastened his end with their swords and spears
2 CONC . Thus Mithridates, who had experienced the most varied and remarkable fortune, had not even an ordinary end to his life. For he desired to die, albeit unwillingly, and though eager to kill himself wa
2 CONC s unable to do so; but partly by poison and partly by the sword he was at once self-slain and murdered by his foes.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the behest of Pompey, Mithridates' body was later buried alongside his ancestors (in either Sinope or Amaseia). Mount Mithridat in the central Kerch and the town of Yevpatoria in Crimea commemor

2 CONT <p>'''Mithridates' antidote'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In his youth, after the assassination of his father Mithridates V in 120 BC, Mithridates is said to have lived in the wilderness for seven years, inuring himself to hardship. While there, and after
2 CONC  his accession, he cultivated an immunity to poisons by regularly ingesting sub-lethal doses of the same. He invented a complex "universal antidote" against poisoning; several versions are described i
2 CONC n the literature. Aulus Cornelius Celsus gives one in his De Medicina and names it Antidotum Mithridaticum, whence English mithridate. Pliny the Elder's version comprised 54 ingredients to be placed i
2 CONC n a flask and matured for at least two months. After Mithridates' death in 63 BC, many imperial Roman physicians claimed to possess and improve on the original formula, which they touted as Mithradati
2 CONC um. In keeping with most medical practices of his era, Mithridates' anti-poison routines included a religious component; they were supervised by the Agari, a group of Scythian shamans who never left h
2 CONC im. Mithridates was reportedly guarded in his sleep by a horse, a bull, and a stag, which would whinny, bellow, and bleat whenever anyone approached the royal bed.

2 CONT <p>'''Mithridates as polyglot'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Pliny the Elder's account of famous polyglots, Mithridates could speak the languages of all the twenty-two nations he governed. This reputation led to the use of Mithridates' name as title in so
2 CONC me later works on comparative linguistics, such as Conrad Gessner's Mithridates de differentis linguis, (1555), and Adelung and Vater's Mithridates oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde (1806–1817).

2 CONT <p>'''Wives, mistresses and children'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates VI had wives and mistresses, by whom he had various children. The names he gave his children are a representation of his Persian, Greek heritage and of his ancestry.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>First wife, his sister Laodice. They were married from 115/113 BC till about 90 BC. Mithridates with Laodice had various children:</p>
2 CONT <p>* Sons: Mithridates, Arcathius, Machares and Pharnaces II of Pontus</p>
2 CONT <p>* Daughters: Cleopatra of Pontus (sometimes called Cleopatra the Elder to distinguish her from her sister of the same name) and Drypetina (a diminutive form of "Drypetis"). Drypetina was Mithridate
2 CONC s VI’s most devoted daughter. Her baby teeth never fell out, so she had a double set of teeth.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Second wife, the Greek Macedonian Noblewoman, Monime. They were married from about 89/88 BC till 72/71 BC. By whom, he had:</p>
2 CONT <p>* Daughter: Athenais, who married King Ariobarzanes II of Cappadocia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Third wife, Greek woman Berenice of Chios, married from 86–72/71 BC</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Fourth wife, Greek woman Stratonice of Pontus, married from after 86–63 BC</p>
2 CONT <p>* Son: Xiphares</p>

2 CONT <p>Fifth wife, unknown</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sixth wife, Caucasian woman Hypsicratea, married from an unknown date to 63 BC</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>One of his mistresses was the Galatian Celtic Princess Adobogiona the Elder. By Adobogiona, Mithridates had two children: a son called Mithridates I of the Bosporus and a daughter called Adobogiona
2 CONC  the Younger.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His sons born from his concubine were Cyrus, Xerxes, Darius, Ariarathes IX of Cappadocia, Artaphernes, Oxathres, Phoenix (Mithridates’ son by a mistress of Syrian descent) and Exipodras, named af
2 CONC ter kings of the Persian Empire, which he claimed ancestry from. His daughters born from his concubine were Nysa, Eupatra, Cleopatra the Younger, Mithridates and Orsabaris. Nysa and Mithridates, were 
2 CONC engaged to the Egyptian Greek Pharaohs Ptolemy XII Auletes and his brother Ptolemy of Cyprus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 63 BC, when the Kingdom of Pontus was annexed by the Roman general Pompey the remaining sisters, wives, mistresses and children of Mithridates VI in Pontus were put to death. Plutarch writing in
2 CONC  his lives (Pompey v.45) states that Mithridates' sister and five of his children took part in Pompey's triumphal procession on this return to Rome in 61 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Cappadocian Greek nobleman and high priest of the temple-state of Comana, Cappadocia Archelaus had descended from Mithridates VI. He claimed to be a son of Mithridates VI, however chronological

2 CONT <p>'''Literature'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The poet A. E. Housman alludes to Mithridates' antidote, also known as mithridatism, in the final stanza of his poem "Terence, This Is Stupid Stuff" in A Shropshire Lad:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''There was a king reigned in the East: There, when kings will sit to feast, They get their fill before they think With poisoned meat and poisoned drink. He gathered all that springs to birth From 
2 CONC the many-venomed earth; First a little, thence to more, He sampled all her killing store; And easy, smiling, seasoned sound, Sate the king when healths went round. They put arsenic in his meat And sta

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ralph Waldo Emerson included his "Mithridates" in his 1847 "Poems". The legend also appears in Alexandre Dumas's novel The Count of Monte Cristo. The demise of Mithridates VI is detailed in the 167
2 CONC 3 play Mithridate written by Jean Racine. This play is the basis for several 18th century operas including one of Mozart's earliest, known most commonly by its Italian name, Mitridate, re di Ponto (17
2 CONC 70). He is the subject of the opera Mitridate Eupatore (1707) by Alessandro Scarlatti. In The Grass Crown, the second in the Masters of Rome series, Colleen McCullough, the Australian writer, describe
2 CONC s in detail the various aspects of his life – the murder of Laodice (sister-wife of Mithridates VI of Pontus), and the Roman Consul who, quite alone and surrounded by the Pontic army, ordered Mithri
2 CONC dates to leave Cappadocia immediately and go back to Pontus – which he did.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Wordsworth, amidst casting about for poetic themes in The Prelude (Bk i vv 186 ff):</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Sometimes, more sternly moved, I would relate How vanquished Mithridates northward passed, And, hidden in the cloud of years, became Odin, the Father of a race by whom Perished the Roman Empire.'
2 CONC '</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Likewise, Edna St. Vincent Millay alludes indirectly to Mithridates' protection against poison in her sonnet "Thou art not lovelier than lilacs" (from Renascence and Other Poems, 1917):</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Like him who day by day unto his draught Of delicate poison adds him one drop more Till he may drink unharmed the death of ten, Even so, inured to beauty, who have quaffed Each hour more deeply t

2 CONT <p>In the novel Mithridates is Dead (Spanish: Mitrídates ha muerto), Ignasi Ribó traces parallels between the historical figures of Mithridates and Osama Bin Laden. Within a postmodern narrative of

2 CONT <p>From A.E. Housman "Terence, this is stupid stuff"</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Review and summary:</p>
2 CONT <p>Both Sulla and Marius wanted the honor of disposing of the greatestchallenge to Roman supremacy since Hannibal Barca -- the long-livedMithridates VI of Pontus (132-63 B.C.) who was a thorn in Rome'
2 CONC s side forforty years. The rivalry of the two generals led to loss of Roman blood-- at home (although Sulla also confronted Mithridates).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Despite competence that matched the rival generals' confidence in theirability to check the Eastern despot, it was Pompey the Great who disposedof the Mithridatic problem.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The mountainous district of Pontus lay on the eastern side of the BlackSea, beyond the province of Asia and Bithynia, north of Galatia andCappadocia, west of Armenia, and south of Colchis. In the T
2 CONC hird PunicWar, King Mithridates Euergetes (who claimed descent from the PersianKing Darius) of Pontus helped Rome. Phrygia Maior was given him ingratitude. By the time Rome had annexed Pergamum to cre
2 CONC ate the provinceof Asia (129 B.C.), Pontus was ruled from its capital in Sinope.

2 CONT <p>Mithridates - Youth and Poison</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 120, while still a child, Mithridates Eupator (132-83 B.C.) becameking. His mother (said to have assassinated her husband Mithridates V)ruled in her young son's stead. Afraid his mother would tr
2 CONC y to kill him,Mithridates went into hiding, at which time he started ingesting smalldoses of various poisons in order to develop an immunity. WhenMithridates returned (c. 115-111), he took command, ha
2 CONC d his motherimprisoned (and, possibly, executed), and set about extending hisdominion. After he acquired Greek towns in Colchis and what's now theCrimea, Mithridates established a strong fleet to hold
2 CONC  his territories.Since the Greeks provided revenue, officers, and mercenary soldiers, heset out to extend his Greek resources.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 108/07 Mithridates and Nicomedes II of Bithynia marched intoPaphlagonia. A Roman emisssary tried to force Nicomedes and Mithridatesto restore its king, Astreodon. Instead, Mithridates annexed a 
2 CONC piece ofGalatia which his father was supposed to have inherited from earlierrulers, while Nicomedes, far from restoring Paphlagonia to Astreodon, puthis son on the throne as puppet. The unsuccessful R
2 CONC oman embassy went home.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 102 Mithridates waged war on Cappadocia and installed hiseight-year-old son as king under the regency of a man named Gordius.Mithridates tried to bribe the Roman senators to accept this arrangem
2 CONC ent,his presence in Paphlagonia and Galatia, and to counter Nicomedes' claimto Cappadocia. At the same time, Nicomedes appealed to Rome on behalf ofhis own pretender. Instead of taking a clear side, R
2 CONC ome orderedMithridates to get out of Cappadocia and Nicomedes to leave Paphlagonia.Mithridates obliged and, as he claimed in 89 B.C., he also leftPaphlagonia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Left to their own devices, the Cappadocian nobility selected Ariobarzanesfor their king. Sulla helped Ariobarzanes assume power.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By allying himself with the neighboring kingdom through marriage,Mithridates hoped to expand his empire. The Armenians would do theinvading and reap the spoils while Pontus would gain the territory
2 CONC . Inthis way, Mithridates himself would not antagonize the Romans.
2 CONT <p>In 96/5 Tigranes I inherited the throne of Armenia and marriedMithridates' daughter Cleopatra. In 94, Nicomedes of Bithynia died. By91, Rome was embroiled in its own Social War, leaving Mithridates
2 CONC  anopportunity to expand his empire. He easily persuaded his son-in-law totake Cappadocia, offering to divide the spoils. Next, Mithridates wentafter Nicomedes' successor in Bithynia, Nicomedes III.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The ousted rulers appealed to Rome which ruled that they should berestored. M. Aquilius and Manlius Maltinus were ordered to deal with themonarchs of Pontus and Armenia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Greedy Aquilius suggested a course of action that led to the FirstMithridatic War and his own ironic execution. Aquilius suggested thatsince the Roman proteges in Bithynia and Cappadocia were unabl
2 CONC e to paytheir debt to Rome, they should invade Mithridates' kingdom. To oblige,Nicomedes invaded Pontic territory and closed off the Bithynian Black Seaexit to Pontic ships.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates' response was to turn to the Romans for help, but he wasrebuffed, so he sent his son Ariarathus into Cappadocia to driveAriobazares out. Mithridates then sent an envoy to the Romancommi
2 CONC ssioners. The Romans accused the envoy of threatening war, and sobegan the first Mithridatic War -- without the ratification of the Senateand the Roman people.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates fought back. Since the Roman troops were not prepared,Mithridates saw that he could push into the Roman province of Asia. Hedid so, won, killed Aquilius (see below), and ordered the mas
2 CONC sacre of all(80,000 or, according to Plutarch, 150,000) Italians throughout the area.It is suggested that this was to insure loyalty, because all thoseinvolved in the massacre would have had much to d
2 CONC read from Romanvengeance.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates' reputation for cruelty may not have been deserved. He couldalso be merciful and generous with the people he conquered.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Some cities that surrendered to Mithridates were rewarded with taxrelief. Amnesty was offered those who handed over the Roman generals.Aquilius had fled to the island of Lesbos, but its citizens wa
2 CONC ntingamnesty, handed him over. Unlike the leniency with which Mithridates hadtreated another Roman general, Oppius, whom he set free, Aquilius wasridiculed and then forced to endure an ironic death. S
2 CONC ince it was hisgreed that had set the war in motion, Mithridates had molten gold pouredinto Aquilius' mouth.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates then attempted to add Greece to his territory. He encounteredlittle resistance from Greeks tired of the tax-farming Roman equites. Bythe spring of 87, Mithridates controlled almost all 
2 CONC of Asia Minor,Greece, Thrace, part of Macedon, and dominated the Black Sea and Aegean,with the help of his general, Archelaus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Finally free from pressing business at Rome Sulla left for Greece andAsia Minor where he easily stopped Mithridates' aggression.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It was at the beginning of 87 that Sulla was able to leave Italy, onceagain, for Greece, where he began a string of successful campaigns. For awhile the Greeks remained loyal to the Pontic king, bu
2 CONC t when it becameclear the Romans might be able to restore the old order, the Greekschanged sides, preferring usurious Roman tax-collectors to an Orientaldespot.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to The Treaty of Dardanus at the conclusion of the FirstMithridatic War, Mithridates was still a friend of Rome.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the Romans captured Mithridates' headquarters in Pergamum,Mithridates was ready to make peace. Since Sulla wished to return to Rometo deal with his opponents there, the terms of the treaty (T
2 CONC reaty ofDardanus, 85/4 B.C.) were not as terrible for Mithridates as they wouldhave been otherwise. Mithridates retained Pontus, the rest of histerritories, his status as ally of Rome, but had to aban
2 CONC don his part ofPaphlagonia and Asia, restore Bithynia to Nicomedes and Cappadocia toAriobarzanes, return his prisoners, and pay 2-3000 talents as warindemnity and provide Sulla with 70-80 fully equipp
2 CONC ed ships.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>83-63 B.C.</p>
2 CONT <p>When Mithridates failed to live up to his agreement to leave Cappadocia,a second Mithridatic War broke out in 83. Propraetor Murena invadedPontus but was forced to withdraw. In 81, peace was declar
2 CONC ed followingthe terms of the treaty of Dardanus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the time of the rebellion of Spartacus, Rome sent in Lucius LiciniusLucullus and Aurelius Cotta to deal with Mithridates. Lucullus' troopswere in no shape to fight.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 75 or 74 Nicomedes III of Bithynia died, bestowing his kingdom uponRome. Threatened by the power of Rome in such proximity, Mithridates tookhis largest force into the neighboring kingdom, occupi
2 CONC ed Bithynia, andsent smaller forces against Asia, Cappadocia and Phrygia. In return, torepel Mithridates from Asia, the Roman senate sent Lucius LiciniusLucullus. Marcus Aurelius Cotta was sent with a
2 CONC  fleet to occupy Bithynia.When Lucullus arrived he found troops in need of discipline. Trainingthem kept him from helping Cotta, making it easy for Mithridates todefeat Cotta at Chalcedon and then bes
2 CONC eige Cyzicus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Finally equipped with barely disciplined troops, Lucullus severedMithridates' land communication, while the citizens of Cyzicus held outagainst the seige long enough for Mithridates to change his m

2 CONT <p>According to The Treaty of Dardanus at the conclusion of the FirstMithridatic War, Mithridates was still a friend of Rome.</p>

2 CONT <p>After the Romans captured Mithridates' headquarters in Pergamum,Mithridates was ready to make peace. Since Sulla wished to return to Rometo deal with his opponents there, the terms of the treaty (T

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates tended to retreat when the Romans showed force. When Lucullusdrove into Mithridates' kingdom of Pontus, Mithridates fled to Armenia.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Once again, Mithridates decided to retreat. Lucullus did not immediatelypursue him, but instead gathered a fleet from the cities in Asia. Then,in 73, with his new fleet he almost destoyed Mithridat
2 CONC es. Lucullus wentinto Pontus to fight Mithridates at Cabira. Routed, Mithridates fled toArmenia looking for help from his son-in-law Tigranes. The Armenian kingwas not willing to provide military aid,
2 CONC  but only shelter.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tigranes may not have been anxious to fight the Romans, but he wasn'tabout to surrender his father-in-law, Mithridates.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Meanwhile, unopposed, Lucullus captured almost the entire kingdom ofPontus. He then ordered Tigranes to surrender Mithridates. When Tigranesrefused, Lucullus attacked Armenia.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lucullus' main obstacles, at this time, were his own soldiers who refusedfurther campaigns. This mutiny gave Mithridates the chance to take backsome of the territory he had lost. Realizing they nee
2 CONC ded another leader,the Romans sent Pompey to Asia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When properly equipped with disciplined troops and a competent general,there was no contest between Rome and Pontus.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pompey began invading Pontus in 66 B.C. Mithridates tried unsuccessfullyto enlist the support of Tigranes, but his brother-in-law had troubles ofhis own. Tigranes's son, backed by Rome, was seeking
2 CONC  his father's throne.Without his ally, Mithridates fled to his possessions in the Crimea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It is said that when Mithridates saw that the people of the Crimeasupported his son over him, Mithridates endeavored to take his own life,but failed because of the resistance he'd built up to poiso

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pompey (named Magnus, the Great, for his victory over Mithridates) hadMithridates' corpse buried honorably in the royal tomb at Sinope.</p>

2 CONT <p>Life.</p>
2 CONT <p>Mithradates the Great was the sixth--and last--Pontic ruler by that name. Mithradates (often misspelled Mithridates and meaning "gift of [the god] Mithra") was a common name among Anatolian rulers 
2 CONC of the age. When Mithradates VI succeeded his father, Mithradates Euergetes, in 120 BC, he was then only 11 years of age, and for a few years his mother ruled in his place. About 115 BC, she was depos
2 CONC ed and thrown into prison by her son, who thereafter ruled alone. Mithradates began his long career of conquest by dispatching successful expeditions to the Crimea and to Colchis (on the eastern shore
2 CONC  of the Black Sea). Both districts were added to the Pontic kingdom. To the Greeks of the Tauric Chersonese and the Cimmerian Bosporus (Crimea and Straits of Kerch), Mithradates was a deliverer from t
2 CONC heir Scythian enemies, and they gladly surrendered their independence in return for the protection given to them by his armies. In Anatolia, however, the royal dominions had been considerably diminish
2 CONC ed after the death of Mithradates V: Paphlagonia had freed itself, and Phrygia (c. 116 BC) had been linked to the Roman province of Asia. Mithradates' first move there was to partition Paphlagonia and
2 CONC  Galatia between himself and Nicomedes III of Bithynia, but next he quarreled with Nicomedes over Cappadocia. Successful at first on two occasions, he was on both deprived of his advantage by Roman in
2 CONC tervention (c. 95 and 92). While appearing to acquiesce, he resolved to expel the Romans from Asia. A first attempt to depose Nicomedes IV of Bithynia, who was completely subservient to the Romans, wa
2 CONC s frustrated (c. 90). Then Nicomedes, instigated by Rome, attacked Pontic territory, and Mithradates, after protesting in vain to the Romans, finallydeclared war (88).
2 CONT <p>Nicomedes and the Roman armies were defeated and flung back to the coasts of the Propontis and the Aegean. The Roman province of Asia was occupied, and most of the Greek cities in western Asia Mino
2 CONC r allied themselves with Mithradates, though a few held out against him, such as Rhodes, which he besieged unsuccessfully. He also sent large armies into Greece, where Athens and other cities took his
2 CONC  side. But the Roman generals, Sulla in Greece and Fimbria in Asia, defeated his forces in several battles during 86 and 85. In 88 he had arranged a general massacre of the Roman and Italian residents
2 CONC  in Asia (80,000 are said to have perished), in order that the Greek cities, as his accessories in the crime, should feel irrevocably committed to the struggle against Rome. As the war turned against 
2 CONC him, his former leniency toward the Greeks changed to severity; every kind of intimidation was resorted to--deportations, murders, freeing of slaves. But this reign of terror couldnot prevent the citi
2 CONC es from deserting to the victorious side. In 85, when the war was clearly lost, he made peace with Sulla in the Treaty of Dardanus, abandoning his conquests, surrendering his fleet, and paying a large
2 CONC  fine.
2 CONT <p>In what is called the Second Mithradatic War, the Roman general Lucius Licinius Murena invaded Pontus without provocation in 83 but was defeated in 82. Hostilities were suspended, but disputes cons
2 CONC tantly occurred, and in 74 a general war broke out. Mithradates defeated Marius Aurelius Cotta, the Roman consul, at Chalcedon, but Lucullus worsted him outside Cyzicus (73) and drove him, in 72, to t
2 CONC ake refuge in Armenia with his son-in-law Tigranes. After scoring two great victories at Tigranocerta (69) and Artaxata (68), Lucullus was disconcerted by the defeat of his lieutenants and by mutiny a
2 CONC mong his troops. In 66 Lucullus was superseded by Pompey, who completely defeated both Mithradates and Tigranes.
2 CONT <p>Mithradates then established himself in 64 at Panticapaeum (Kerch) onthe Cimmerian Bosporus and was planning an invasion of Italy by way of the Danube when his own troops, led by his son Pharnaces 
2 CONC II, revolted against him. After failing in an attempt to poison himself, Mithradates ordered a Gallic mercenary to kill him. His body was sent to Pompey, who buried it in the royal sepulchre at Sinope
2 CONC , the Pontic capital.
2 CONT <p>Assessment.</p>
2 CONT <p>Mithradates was a man of great stature and physical strength, a bravefighter, and a keen hunter. He also had some of the worst traits often associated with the Oriental despot--cruelty and sensuali
2 CONC ty, in particular. But it cannot be denied that Mithradates was a ruler of astonishing energy and determination, or that he possessed political skill of a high order. That he was one of the few men to
2 CONC  offer a serious challenge to the Roman Republic is sufficient testimony to his ability. He organized the forces at his disposal very effectively, and he had agood grasp of strategy. He was unlucky in
2 CONC  having to face three exceptionally brilliant Roman generals; unlucky, too, in coming to power ata time when the Hellenistic world was in the final stage of its collapse. It is quite conceivable that 
2 CONC had he been born a century earlier he could have constructed an enduring Greco-Asiatic empire. A cunning,brutal tyrant, he concerned himself solely with maintaining and strengthening his own power. He
2 CONC  posed as the champion of Hellenism, but this was mainly to further his political ambitions; it is no proof that he was deeply imbued with Greek culture or that he felt a mission to promote its extens
2 CONC ion within his domains. Hellenism made advances in Pontus during his reign, as it had under his predecessors, but this wasa natural process. He treated all alike; Greek, Roman, and Asiatic were welcom
2 CONC e at his court provided that they could be of use to him (hismilitary subordinates were mostly Greeks, though in later years he employed several Roman renegades), but he trusted no one. Just as it is 
2 CONC impossible to speak of his favouring one religion or culture above another, so it is impossible to believe that he had any notion of bringing Greeks and Asiatics closer together in a new kind of polit
2 CONC ical and social system. His posing as a liberator of the Greeks from Roman oppression and, later, his encouragement of social revolution in the Greekcities of the province of Asia can only be interpre

2 CONT <p>History</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates VI was the son of Mithridates V of Pontus (150 BC – 120 BC), called Euergetes. Mithridates VI spent much of his early career as a fugitive. To clear his path to the throne of the king
2 CONC dom of Pontus, he killed off many of his brothers but not his sister, Laodice, whom he married. He was ambitious and sought to invade a number of neighbours, including Bithynia, which brought him into
2 CONC  conflict with the expanding Roman Republic during its later years.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After conquering western Anatolia in 88 BC, Mithridates VI ordered the killing of all Romans living there. The massacre of 80,000 Roman men, women and children brought matters to a head. During the
2 CONC  First Mithridatic War fought between 88 BC and 84 BC, Lucius Cornelius Sulla forced Mithridates VI out of Greece proper but then had to return to Italy to answer the threat posed by Marius; subsequen
2 CONC tly, Mithridates VI was defeated but not beaten. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved a mere temporary setback. Mithridates VI recouped his forces, and when Rome attempted to anne
2 CONC x Bithynia, Mithridates VI attacked with an even larger army, leading to the Second Mithridatic War from 83 BC to 81 BC. First Lucullus and then Pompey the Great were sent against Mithridates VI, who 
2 CONC was at last defeated by Pompey in the Third Mithridatic War of 75 BC to 65 BC. After his final defeat in 65 BC, Mithridates VI fled and attempted to raise yet another army to take on the Romans but fa
2 CONC iled to do so. In 63, he fled to the citadel in Panticapaeum. Later he marched north with a small amount of men. At Colchis he commandeered a fleet and went to his eldest son, Manchares's kingdom of B
2 CONC osporus. However, when he arrived he found his son had betrayed him. Manchares committed suicide and Mithridates Eupator VI took the throne of Bosporus. Mithridates ordered the conscription of many Sc
2 CONC ythians in order to regain his kingdom. Pharnaces II, his younger son led a Scythian rebellion against his father. This rebellion was caused by Roman exiles that Mithridates kept as the core of his Po
2 CONC ntic army. Mithridates attempted suicide but was unsuccessful because of his immunity to poison. He later asked his cheif bodygaurd, Bitiutus to kill him. Thus the last king of Pontus disappeared off 
2 CONC the face of the earth. [1][2]

2 CONT <p>Culture</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Two curious legends are told of Mithridates VI of Pontus. First, he was supposed to have had a prodigious memory. Pliny the Elder and other historians report that Mithridates could speak the langua
2 CONC ges of all the twenty-two nations he governed. [1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From this legend, several books that published samples of many languages were entitled Mithridates.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The second legend is that Mithridates VI sought to harden himself against poisoning by taking increasing sub-lethal doses of the poisons he knew of until he was able to tolerate lethal doses. A. E.
2 CONC  Housman alludes to this practice, also known as mithridatism, in the poem Terence, this is stupid stuff in A Shropshire Lad. The legend also appears in the novel, The Count of Monte Cristo. Out of fe
2 CONC ar of being poisoned by one of his many enemies, Mithridates VI fashioned a universal antidote, Antidotum Mithridaticum, consisting of several ingredients. Among the ingredients were opium and honey;

2 CONT <p>The Aftermath of Caesar's Death (44 B.C.). Caesar's assassins claimed tobe striking a blow for freedom in the name of the Old Republic; insteadof dancing in streets, however, the initial reaction t
2 CONC o the news ofCaesar's murder was intense uncertainty, particularly among the rulingelite, as everyone waited to see who would make the next move. Theconspirators themselves went into hiding. *M. Aemil
2 CONC ius Lepidus (oneCaesar's lieutenants, who had a legion of recruits ready to take to Gaul)imposed order, but Mark Antony (who had long been Caesar's right-hand manand was consul along with Caesar in 44
2 CONC ) soon took charge of matters,leaving Lepidus to depart for Gaul. Antony was in nominal control ofstate affairs, but virtually everyone was on eggshells. Antony wielded agood deal of power as consul a

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Octavian and Antony. When Caesar's will was read, however, Antonyreceived a nasty shock. In it Caesar named as his chief heir a virtualunknown by the name of *C. Octavius, adopting him (posthumousl
2 CONC y) as hisson. Octavius was Caesar's grand-nephew on his sister's side, a rathersickly 18-year-old with only limited political and military experience.Upon his adoption, Octavius became *C. Julius Caes
2 CONC ar Octavianus (or, inEnglish, simply Octavian). Antony might well have expected little troublein dealing with a youth of so little experience, few politicalconnections, and virtually no personal autho
2 CONC rity. Unfortunately, Antonyfailed to recognize that in Octavian he was dealing with a
2 CONT <p>natural born politician. Octavian never was an imposing figurephysically, and he owed his military victories largely to the skill ofhis able lieutenants. In the political realm, however, he was wit
2 CONC houtpeer, rising from a virtual unknown in 44 B.C. to become the first of theJulio-Claudian emperors by 27 AD. Tensions immediately arose betweenOctavian and Antony, as each vied for the right to empl
2 CONC oy Caesar'ssubstantial financial resources, to call upon the loyalty of his troops,and, above all, to invoke the authority of Caesar's name. On the one handwas Antony, Caesar's second in command who h
2 CONC ad served him so ably sincethe 50s, who had been named magister equitum under Caesar, and who hadbeen appointed priest (flamen) in Caesar's honor; on the other wasOctavian, who could claim to be Caesa
2 CONC r's son and heir. Tensions betweenthe two soon reached the boiling point, only to be checked by seniorofficers in command of Caesar's troops, who were united by their commonloyalty to the dead Caesar 
2 CONC and were unwilling to fight against oneanother in the name of Caesar's bickering heirs. By the middle of 44 B.C.an uneasy truce was established between Antony, Octavian, the Senate, andthose involved 
2 CONC in Caesar's assassination.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Unfortunately Antony, while an able commander, was no Caesar when it cameto the delicate art of politics. In 44-43 he soon alienated virtually allof the other factions listed above, uniting them ag
2 CONC ainst him. He began byfoolishly attacking the orator and statesman Cicero, a leader of thesenatorial faction (the optimates). These personal attacks led Cicero todenounce Antony in a series of damning
2 CONC  speeches, known as the *Philippics.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Not content with alienating Cicero and the Senate, Antony renewed hisattacks against Octavian, charging him with plots against his (Antony's)life. Octavian saw that his position in Rome was far fro
2 CONC m secure andwithdrew to central Italy, where he began to raise troops on hisauthority as Caesar's son and heir.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the end of 44, Antony stepped over the line altogether. As consul in44 he had been assigned the province of Macedonia for 43. Antonyrealized, however, that departing from Rome at this particular
2 CONC  juncturewould be political suicide and so passed a law that awarded him afive-year command in Cisalpine Gaul and Gallia Comata (Gaul proper)instead.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>This would allow him to keep tabs on affairs in Rome and had the addedadvantage of providing him with an army camped just north of Italy.(Clearly Antony had the precedent of Caesar's own career in 
2 CONC mind.) Thethreat now posed by Octavian led Antony to speed up his plans: he decidedto proceed to Cisalpine Gaul and assume command of his new provincesearly. At this point the Senate was still unwilli
2 CONC ng to defy Antony tooopenly, but it did direct the current governor of Cisalpine Gaul, D.Junius Brutus Albinus (who had been involved in the conspiracy againstCaesar), to maintain his position. When m
2 CONC atters reached a crisis theSenate, at Cicero's urging, turned to Octavian for help. Octavian had hisown forces; more importantly, he could invoke the name of Caesar, thusundercutting Antony's claims t
2 CONC o represent Caesar's legacy. Cicero hopedthat the young Octavian would be malleable -- a tool that the Senatecould employ and then discard at its will. The plan was to have Octaviansupport the consuls
2 CONC  for 43 (A. Hirtius and C. Vibius Pansa) in drivingAntony off, then to have Octavian surrender his troops to Brutus, thelawful governor of the region. The first part of the plan worked: Antonywas comp
2 CONC elled to retire further into Gaul, where he joined up withLepidus (see above). Unfortunately for Cicero and the Senate, however,Octavian was neither malleable nor stupid. He realized that, were he tos
2 CONC urrender his troops to Brutus, he would not only lose an importantbargaining chip but, given Brutus' association with Caesar's murder,would fatally undermine his claims to be Caesar's loyal son. As it
2 CONC happened, through one of those twists of fate that seem to occur so oftenin Roman history, the two consuls Hirtius and Pansa had been killed inthe battle against Antony: Octavian saw a vacuum and marc
2 CONC hed south withhis forces, determined to fill it. Confronted with Octavian's troops, theSenate was compelled to allow him to run for the office of consul, towhich he was duly elected for the year 42. H
2 CONC is adoption by Caesar wasofficially ratified and Caesar's assassins outlawed: thus Octavian couldassume the role of the loyal son attempting to avenge his father's murderand continue his father's work
2 CONC  in "reforming" the state. (The leaders ofthe opposition to Caesar, M. Junius Brutus and C. Cassius Longinus, hadalready fled to the East, planning, like Pompey earlier, to raise troopsand challenge A
2 CONC ntony and Octavian.)
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Second Triumvirate. Suddenly Octavian was no longer a youthfuloutsider but a major force with which to reckon. He realized, however,that his own position vis a vis the Senate was far from secur
2 CONC e anddecided to make common cause with his former enemy, Antony. Thus, in 43,Octavian,
2 CONT <p>Antony, and Lepidus were officially appointed as a panel of three (atriumvirate) to govern Rome with consular authority for a period of fiveyears for the purpose of restoring constitutional order. 
2 CONC This alliance isknown as the *Second Triumvirate. Through a curious twist of fate, Caesar-- who originally had been viewed as a dangerous, power-seeking popularisand a traitor -- now became the belove
2 CONC d leader whose legacy was beingthreatened and in whose name Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus must seizecontrol of state affairs.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Despite its official standing, the Second Triumvirate was in reality amilitary junta. Following the precedent of Sulla, its first order ofbusiness was to pay back its political enemies and raise so
2 CONC me much-neededcash (necessary if the junta's troops were to be kept happy).Proscriptions were held in which some 300 senators and 2000 equites weredispatched, as much for their property as for their p
2 CONC olitical sympathies.The most famous victim was Cicero, whose head and hands were cut off andhung from the speaker's platform (the Rostra) in the forum. [TheTriumvirate also raised taxes, aiming first 
2 CONC (as was the Romans' wont) atwealthy and "extravagant" women. This policy led to a woman namedHortensia presenting a public speech in the forum in which, we are told,she sounded the now familiar theme 
2 CONC of no taxation without representation(i.e., without granting women the franchise).]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The next order of business, once matters had been settled in Rome, was todeal with the forces of Brutus and Cassius in the East. The official linewas that these forces were traitors to Rome, led by
2 CONC  Caesar's assassins.Viewed objectively, however, they represented one of the last hopes ofthe Roman Republic, fighting a cause that was utterly unrealistic -- thedays when the traditional constitution
2 CONC al Machinery could cope with theeconomic, social, and political realities in Rome were long past -- butnoble nonetheless. The final confrontation occurred in 42 at *Philippi inMacedonia (see Map 3 in 
2 CONC Dudley), where Brutus' and Cassius' forces werequickly defeated in a series of battles by the combined forces of Antonyand Octavian. The victory led to an immediate rise in Antony's fortunes:never muc
2 CONC h of a general, Octavian had presented a poor showing atPhilippi, losing one important battle and spending a good deal of thetime sick in his tent. For the moment, at least, Antony was very much these
2 CONC nior partner among the triumvirs.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>With their enemies subdued both at Rome and abroad, the two leadingmembers of the Triumvirate soon returned to their old personal rivalries.Lepidus was quickly gotten out of the way: accused of tre
2 CONC ason, he wasdeprived of his provinces and allowed to remain a member of theTriumvirate only on sufferance. The other two triumvirs divided Rome'sholdings between them: Octavian got Spain, Antony Gaul.
2 CONC  Antony, however,had larger ambitions. Encouraged by his success at Philippi, he revivedCaesar's plans for a grand military campaign in the East. His intentionsclearly were to follow the precedent set
2 CONC  by Sulla, Pompey, and Caesarhimself: to win power, fame, and money through a series of militarytriumphs abroad and then return to Rome and oust his political rivalsonce and for all. In 41, therefore,
2 CONC  he set out for the East, where hesoon became entangled with the Egyptian Cleopatra.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cleopatra VII left three children by Marcus Antonius: the twins AlexanderHelios and Cleopatra Selene, born in 40 B.C. and Ptolemy Philadelphus,born in 36 B.C. In 33 B.C. Antonius designated Alexand
2 CONC er to be king ofArmenia and overlord of Parthia and Media. He designated Ptolemy to beruler of all Egyptian possessions in Syria and Cilicia and overlord ofall client-kings and dynasts west of the Eup
2 CONC hrates, as far as theHellespont. After the death of Antonius, both boys were taken in byAugustus's sister Octavia to be raised with her own children. They appearsoon after in Augustus's Triumph in Rom
2 CONC e and thereafter disappear fromhistory. Speculation is that both died in childhood. Cleopatra Selene wasmarried in 29 B.C. to Juba II, a Roman client-king who ruled over Numidiac30-25 B.C. and over Ma
2 CONC uretania 25 B.C.-cA.D. 23 when he died in hismid-70s. Cleopatra had long before predeceased him, though the date isnot known. They had two (known) children: Ptolemy succeeded his father asking of Maur
2 CONC etania in A.D. 23. In 40, he was called to Rome to appearbefore the Emperor Caligula. Tacitus reports he had the misfortune ofpresenting himself wearing such a sumptious purple robe that in envyCaligu
2 CONC la had him put to death. One simply did not appear before Caligulawearing better duds than the boss. Although Ptolemy was certainly of amarriageable age, no wife or children are known, and none succee
2 CONC ded himas king. Ptolemy's sister Drusilla was married to Marcus Antonius Felix.Nothing has survived in recorded history to point to any issue of thismarriage.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Octavian, by contrast, was given the thankless task of dealing withaffairs in Italy, particularly the necessity of finding land for his andAntony's veterans. Antony clearly hoped that Octavian woul
2 CONC d becomeembroiled in Italian politics, squandering both his time and, moreimportant, his popularity with the masses. In the end, this was a poorstrategy on Antony's part. Not only did his own military
2 CONC  ventures notfare well, but, by leaving Octavian in Rome, he allowed his rival to plyhis considerable political skills in waging a propaganda war againstAntony.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At first, however, Antony's plan appeared to succeed. Octavian's problemwas to find land for his and Antony's veterans; his solution was toconfiscate land throughout Italy. The Italian cities were 
2 CONC outraged, andthis sense of outrage was encouraged by Antony's wife Fulvia and hisbrother L. Antonius, who incited a civil war. The rebels were suppressedthrough a combination of Antony's delay in supp
2 CONC orting them and thebrutality of Octavian's reprisals (particularly against the city ofPerusia, in the so-called Perusine War). Antony eventually returned toItaly in 40, landing at Brundisium, but by t
2 CONC hen Octavian had not onlysecured Italy but had seized Gaul. War nearly broke out between Antonyand Octavian, but their troops refused to fight against one another. Atlast a deal was cut: Antony was to
2 CONC  pursue his ambitions in the East,while Octavian was granted the western half of Rome's empire. To cementthe deal, Antony married Octavian's sister *Octavia (Fulvia having diedof natural causes in the
2 CONC  meantime).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony accordingly returned east, where from 40-35 he was engaged in aseries of largely unsuccessful campaigns against the Parthians. Hisdesperate need for financial and military support drove him 
2 CONC into the armsof Cleopatra (literally and figuratively) and he became her officialconsort. Antony had 3 children by Cleopatra. In 36, despite their age (6,6, and 2, respectively), he granted each of th
2 CONC ese children, as well asCleopatra herself, territories in the East as their official realms; healso lent his support to the claims of Caesarion (then 13 years old) tobe Caesar's true son and heir. To 
2 CONC Roman eyes these moves were troubling,suggesting that Antony was becoming a champion of
2 CONT <p>Egypt and its oriental queen.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Meanwhile, Octavian was busy in the West fighting *Sextus Pompeius, a sonof Pompey the Great. Sextus had gathered the last of the Republicanopposition about him in Spain and by 42 controlled Sicily
2 CONC . With hisfleet, Sextus was able to harass Roman shipping, nearly cutting off Rome's
2 CONT <p>grain supplies. To the degree that Sextus could claim to be fighting forthe cause of his father, Pompey, he represented the last forces of theold Republic; in reality, he was as much a military ove
2 CONC rlord/adventureras Antony and Octavian. Octavian once again showed his lack of militaryexperience, suffering a series of humiliating defeats, and, in 38, wasforced to meet with Antony in order to ask 
2 CONC for reinforcements. (At thesame time the term of the Triumvirate, originally slated to expire in 38,was extended for another five years.) In 36 Octavian -- or, rather, hisgeneral *M. Vipsanius Agrippa
2 CONC , working in tande M with Lepidus -- finallydefeated Sextus at the battle of Naulochus. Lepidus made an attempt toseize Sicily for himself, but was soon deserted by his supporters andcaptured. As pont
2 CONC ifex maximus Lepidus could not be killed (as we shallsee, Octavian was beginning to develop scruples!), so he was merelystripped of his official powers and placed under permanent house arrestin Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Actium. The year 36 marks something of a turning point in Octavian'scareer. From this point on he began to doff the role of ruthless militarywarlord and instead present himself as a defender of the
2 CONC  Republic (suchas it was!). This strategy was to stand him in good stead in thepropaganda war against Antony. Antony, Octavian could claim, had becomethe thrall of a depraved eastern
2 CONT <p>monarch: he had "gone native" and (Octavian claimed) planned to reduceRome to a mere subject state, transferring the capital of the empire toEgypt. The Romans would be slaves to a mongrel horde of 
2 CONC oriental eunuchsand their lascivious queen, compelled to worship Egypt's decadent,bestial gods and to adopt the perverse religious practices of a landwhose rulers regularly married their own siblings.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tensions between Antony and Octavian began to reach a head in 35, whenAntony formally repudiated Octavia, who had remained loyal to him despitethe repeated humiliation to which he had subjected her
2 CONC . In 33, when theTriumvirate officially expired, Octavian held the consulship: he was thenable to present Antony as a private Roman citizen acting without theauthority of the state and to contrast his
2 CONC  own position as loyal servantof the Republic. There followed, in 32, the public reading of Antony'swill (which, according to custom, had been deposited in Rome for safekeeping): the provisions it con
2 CONC tained were not outrageous -- for example,Antony asked to be buried with Cleopatra and requested officialrecognition for his children by Cleopatra and for Caesarion -- but theyfurthered the impression
2 CONC  that Antony now regarded himself as an Egyptian.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>n the end war was inevitable. The issue was decided in 31 at the navalbattle of *Actium (in northwest Greece). Antony had established camp inthe bay of Actium in late 32, hoping to use it as a base
2 CONC  of operationsagainst Octavian. He became mired there, however, his lines of supply cutoff and his forces steadily shrinking due to disease and desertion. Astime wore on, his troops became ever more d
2 CONC e Moralized, in part due tothe presence of Cleopatra in their camp: Roman soldiers did not like theidea of being the servants of a foreign queen (think of Livy's portrayalof Tanaquil). Moreover, Anton
2 CONC y's Egyptian fleet was outnumbered andout-generaled by Octavian's fleet, led by Agrippa. By September of 31Antony had realized that his position was untenable and attempted to slipaway with his fleet 
2 CONC to Asia Minor. His plans were poorly executed by hisde Moralized troops, however, and only Cleopatra's ships managed toescape, followed by Antony with a few Roman stragglers. The remainder ofAntony's 
2 CONC forces surrendered after only token resistance. The battle ofActium was, then, something of a fiasco: a failed tactical retreat.Octavian and his supporters, however, presented it as a glorious triumph
2 CONC ,spreading the story that Antony, accompanied by Cleopatra, had intended afull-scale naval battle but had turned tail and deserted his troops whenhe saw Cleopatra's ship fleeing in fear. In this versi
2 CONC on, Antony isbetrayed by his besotted obsession with the cowardly and depravedEgyptian queen.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony and Cleopatra fled to Egypt, where they committed suicide.Octavian, however, hailed his triumph as belonging to the Roman Senateand people -- a victory for Rome's political and religious tra
2 CONC ditionsover a nefarious threat from the decadent East. (Notice that once againOctavian held the consulship -- his third -- in this crucial year,allowing him once more to present himself as the servant
2 CONC  of the Romanpeople fighting in defense of the Republic, rather than as a militarydespot intent on wiping out a hated rival.) He claimed to have beensupported in this victory by the god *Apollo, who h
2 CONC ad a small temple on anearby promontory. Apollo, the god of Actium, became a prominent figurein Octavian/Augustus' reign. A god of poetry, music, and culture, heprovided a fitting contrast to the "deg
2 CONC enerate" Egyptian culturechampioned by Antony. He also embodied two contrary features thatOctavian found useful, for Apollo was both a powerful god of retribution,smiting those who strayed beyond the 
2 CONC proper bounds set for mortalambitions, and a gentle god of refinement and culture. (These twocontrasting features are symbolized by two of Apollo's attributes: thebow and the lyre.) As we shall see, t
2 CONC he poets and artists who celebratedOctavian/Augustus' achievements presented his career as displaying thesesame two contrasting features, with Actium as the turning point. BeforeActium, we find the st
2 CONC ern triumvir who employs violence to punish hisfather's murderers, restore "order" to Italy, and check the wildambitions of Antony and Cleopatra; after Actium, we find the benign rulerwho oversees a p

2 CONT <p>Juventud de Marco Antonio editar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Perteneciente a la familia de origen patricio de los Antonios (gens Antonia), Marco Antonio nació en Roma en torno al año 83 adC. Su padre fue su tocayo Marco Antonio Crético (Marcus Antonius Cr
2 CONC eticus), hijo a su vez del orador Marco Antonio el O
2 CONT <p>rador (Marcus Antonius Orator), quien fuera ejecutado por los partidarios de Cayo Mario en el 87 adC.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Marco Antonio era sobrino lejano de Julio César por parte de su madre, Julia Caesaris. Su padre murió a una temprana edad, dejando a Marco Antonio, junto con sus hermanos Lucio y Cayo, alcuidado 
2 CONC de su madre. Julia Antonia2 se casó después con Pu
2 CONT <p>blio Cornelio Léntulo Sura, un político acusado de estar involucrado en la conjura de Catilina (63 adC). Por este motivo Cicerón ordenó su ejecución, lo que originó la enemistad entre Antonio
2 CONC  y el célebre orador.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>La vida temprana de Marco Antonio se caracterizó por la falta de una adecuada orientación paterna. De acuerdo con historiadores como Plutarco, pasó sus años de adolescencia vagando por Roma con
2 CONC  sus hermanos y amigos. Juntos se embarcaron en una c
2 CONT <p>lase de vida rebelde y despreocupada, frecuentando casas de apuestas, dándose a la bebida y viéndose involucrados en escándalos amorosos. Plutarco menciona el rumor de que antes de cumplir los v
2 CONC einte años de edad Antonio ya estaba endeudado, debi
2 CONT <p>endo unos 250 talentos (6 millones de sestercios), aunque asumidos por su amigo Escribonio Curión. Asimismo, hacia el año 59 adC entró en contacto con el círculo del polémico Publio Clodio Pul
2 CONC cro y sus bandas callejeras.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Después de este periodo de imprudencias, Antonio huyó a Grecia hacia el año 58 adC para escapar de sus acreedores. Tras un breve periodo invertido en asistir a las clases de los filósofosen Ate
2 CONC nas, donde aprendió retórica como solían hacer otros
2 CONT <p> jóvenes nobles romanos de su época, fue convocado por Aulo Gabinio, procónsul de Siria, para participar en la campaña contra Aristóbulo de Judea, obteniendo su primera distinción militarpor 
2 CONC ser el primero en asaltar una fortificación judía. Pos
2 CONT <p>teriormente participó en la campaña militar de Gabinio en el 55 adC para restablecer en el trono de Egipto a Ptolomeo Auletes, en la cual demostró su talento como prefecto ecuestre (comandante d

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>La influencia de Clodio y de Curión acercaron a Marco Antonio al partido de Julio César, rival de Pompeyo y del Senado romano. En el año 54 adC Marco Antonio entró a formar parte del mando del 
2 CONC ejército de Julio César en las Galias, probando de nu
2 CONT <p>evo su competente liderazgo militar en la guerra de las Galias y destacando en el doble asedio de Alesia, aunque su personalidad provocaba conflictos continuamente, donde quiera que fueseCésar mis
2 CONC mo llegó a decir que su conducta le hacía irritar
2 CONT <p> frecuentemente.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Sin embargo, ascendido por la influencia de César a los cargos de cuestor (52 adC), augur (50 adC) y tribuno de la plebe (49 adC), siempre apoyó la causa de su protector con gran energía.Cuando 
2 CONC los dos mandatos proconsulares de César expiraron (
2 CONT <p>al cabo de 10 años), el general quiso retornar a Roma para las elecciones consulares. Pero la facción conservadora del Senado romano, liderada por Pompeyo, exigió a César que renunciara previam
2 CONC ente a su proconsulado y a la dirección de su ejércit
2 CONT <p>o antes obtener el permiso para solicitar su reelección en el consulado. César no podía permitir esto, ya que pretendía continuar las acciones que iniciara en su mandato de procónsul además, 
2 CONC en ese caso, pasaría a ser (entre el final de su procon
2 CONT <p>sulado y su segundo consulado) un ciudadano privado, lo cual podría dejarle a merced de las tropas de Pompeyo.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antonio sugirió entonces que todos los comandantes que compartían el mismo imperium entregaran el mando, pero la idea fue rechazada, y cuando Antonio recurrió a las amenazas y a sembrar el desco
2 CONC ntento, fue finalmente expulsado del Senado. De esta
2 CONT <p> forma, Antonio huyó de Roma, uniéndose a César, que había dejado su ejército acampado a orillas del Rubicón, el arroyo que marcaba el límite meridional de su autoridad proconsular. Con toda
2 CONC s las esperanzas de hallar una solución pacífica desvane
2 CONT <p>cidas tras la salida de Antonio del Senado, César usó como excusa la figura de Antonio como tribuno de la plebe, y por tanto intocable aun para el Senado, para ordenar el cruce del río y la marc
2 CONC ha de su ejército hacia Roma, comenzando así la últi
2 CONT <p>ma guerra civil. Durante esta contienda, Antonio fue el segundo al mando de César en todas las batallas contra los pompeyanos, Antonio dirigió el ala izquierda del ejército, prueba evidente de l
2 CONC a confianza de César en él.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>La dictadura de César editar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Con César como dictador, Antonio fue nombrado magister equitum, siendo la mano derecha del dictador y permaneciendo como administrador de Italia (47 adC), mientras César luchaba contra los últim
2 CONC os pompeyanos, quienes se habían refugiado en África
2 CONT <p>. Pero las habilidades de Antonio como administrador fueron un pobre reflejo de las que poseía como general, aferrándose a la oportunidad de satisfacer sus más extravagantes excesos (comola comp
2 CONC añía de la actriz liberta Cytheris), que quedaron r
2 CONT <p>eflejados por Cicerón en sus Filípicas. En el año 46 adC Antonio se ofendió cuando César le insistió que pagara las propiedades de Pompeyo que Antonio había simulado comprar, ya que en verda
2 CONC d se había apropiado simplemente de ellas. Los problemas
2 CONT <p> pronto surgieron y, como en otras ocasiones anteriores, Antonio recurrió de nuevo a la violencia: cientos de ciudadanos fueron asesinados, mientras la ciudad de Roma caía en un estado deanarquí
2 CONC a. César mostró su gran disgusto por todo este asun
2 CONT <p>to, y relevó a Antonio de todas sus responsabilidades políticas. Ambos dejaron de verse durante dos años, si bien el distanciamiento no fue muy continuado: Antonio se reunió con el dictador en 
2 CONC Narbona (45 adC), rechazando la propuesta de Trebonio
2 CONT <p> para que se uniera a la conspiración que ya estaba en marcha. La reconciliación definitiva llegó en el 44 adC, cuando Antonio fue elegido colega de César durante el quinto consulado del dictad
2 CONC or, como parte del incipiente plan de César para conq
2 CONT <p>uistar el Imperio Parto, dejando en Roma al nuevo y leal cónsul.</p>

2 CONT <p>Los últimos días de César editar</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cualesquiera que fuesen los problemas surgidos entre ellos, Antonio permaneció fiel a César en todo momento. En febrero del 44 adC, durante las fiestas lupercales (15 de febrero), Antonioofreció
2 CONC  públicamente una diadema a César. Este hecho poseí
2 CONT <p>a un significado preciso: la diadema era un símbolo propio de un rey, y César, al rechazarla, demostraba que no estaba interesado en asumir el trono de Roma.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En los idus de marzo (15 de marzo) de ese mismo año, César fue asesinado por un grupo de senadores, liderados por Cayo Casio Longino y Marco Junio Bruto, mientras Antonio era entretenido en la ha
2 CONC bitación contigua. Bruto rechazó la sugerencia de C
2 CONT <p>asio para acabar también con la vida de Antonio, alegando que su objetivo había sido librarse del dictador, mientras que acabar con un magistrado electo legítimamente significaría un varapalo p
2 CONC ara la causa republicana.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>En el consiguiente alboroto que despertó este crimen en Roma, Antonio escapó de la ciudad vestido como un esclavo, temiendo que el asesinato del dictador fuera el inicio de un baño de sangre con
2 CONC tra todos sus partidarios. Cuando comprobó que esto
2 CONT <p> no sucedía, regresó a Roma, concertando una tregua con la facción de los asesinos. En ese momento Antonio, como cónsul restante nombrado para ese año, simuló perseguir la paz y el final de l
2 CONC a tensión política, a la vez que trataba de afianzarse
2 CONT <p> como líder del partido cesariano por encima de Lépido, cuyas tropas ocuparon el Foro el 16 de marzo. Tras un discurso de Cicerón pronunciado ante el Senado, reunido en el templo de Tellus a ini
2 CONC ciativa de Antonio el día 17 de marzo, se concedió u
2 CONT <p>na amnistía a todos los conjurados, a la vez que se aprobaba un funeral en honor del dictador.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>El día 20 de marzo aconteció el funeral de César, en el cual Antonio, como su fiel segundo en el mando, compañero, colega consular y pariente, fue el lógico elegido para recitar la elegíadel 
2 CONC funeral. Durante su discurso enumeró las gestas de Cés
2 CONT <p>ar y las concesiones en su testamento en favor del pueblo romano, para acabar vertiendo sus acusaciones respecto al asesinato de César, afirmando así su distanciamiento con los conjurados. Mostra
2 CONC ndo un gran talento para la retórica y la interpret
2 CONT <p>ación dramática, Antonio asió la toga del cuerpo de César para mostrar a la muchedumbre las marcas de sus veintitrés heridas. De esta forma, esa misma noche el pueblo romano atacó las casas d
2 CONC e los conjurados, obligándoles a huir para salvar sus v
2 CONT <p>idas y lamentando no haber acabado con el cónsul.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>La posición de Antonio se vio fortalecida hasta tal punto que Calpurnia, la viuda de César, llegó a hacerle entrega de los documentos personales del dictador y a confiarle la custodia de sus bie

2 CONT <p> el apoyo de los veteranos de César tras viajar a Campania, donde habían sido asentados en premio a su lealtad tras las campañas cesarianas, y animarlos a defender la obra de César frentea sus

2 CONT <p>La muerte de César había dejado un gran vacío en la vida política de Roma. La República estaba agonizando, y de nuevo otra guerra civil había comenzado. Fue entonces cuando Cayo Octavio Turin
2 CONC o, sobrino-nieto y a la vez hijo adoptivo de César, lle
2 CONT <p>gó en marzo a Brundisium desde Iliria, reclamando la herencia de su padre adoptivo, que consistía en tres cuartas partes de los bienes del César, según estipulaba en su último testamento.Tras 
2 CONC rechazar los consejos de su madre y su padrastro Marc
2 CONT <p>io Filipo para que rechazara la adopción y la herencia, Octavio obtuvo el apoyo del Senado romano y de Cicerón, a la vez que las tropas veteranas del dictador se reunieron en torno a su bandera. 
2 CONC Octavio se mostraba así muy dispuesto a luchar por
2 CONT <p> el poder con los otros principales aspirantes: Lépido y el propio Antonio.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Tras un primer encuentro amistoso con Antonio a finales de abril del 44 adC en Roma, en el cual Octavio le reprochó no haber perseguido a los conjurados, las desavenencias surgieron pronto cuando 
2 CONC Octavio trató de atraerse a los veteranos campanie
2 CONT <p>nses. Antonio, quien se hallaba en Brundisium desde octubre para hacerse cargo de las legiones procedentes de Macedonia necesarias para atacar la Galia Cisalpina, comprendió el interés desu rival
2 CONC  por desacreditarle ante las tropas, y regresó a R
2 CONT <p>oma con una legión gala, sólo para comprobar que Octavio se le había adelantado marchando hacia la Cisalpina con dos legiones. En Mutina Antonio sitió a Décimo Bruto, si bien Octavio, en calid

2 CONC  quien, irritado ante la negativa del Senado para co
2 CONT <p>ncederle un triunfo y con el compromiso con Décimo Bruto para que mandase las tropas por encima de él, entró en Roma con ocho legiones bajo su mando, obligando al Senado a otorgarle el consulado
2 CONC  (19 de agosto). Consiguió la promulgación de una le
2 CONT <p>x curiata que confirmó la adopción que hiciera César, pasando Octavio a llamarse Cayo Julio César, mientras que sus rivales le conocieron desde ese momento por el hiriente diminutivo de Octavia
2 CONC no. Entre tanto, Décimo Bruto huyó en pos de Marco Br

2 CONT <p>Ante el avance del ejército de Antonio, Octaviano traicionó finalmente al partido senatorial, consciente de que los asesinos de César esperaban en Macedonia una guerra en Italia para abalanzarse
2 CONC  sobre el exhausto vencedor, por lo que llegó a un a

2 CONT <p>Los Triunviros para la organización del pueblo obtuvieron reconocimiento oficial mediante la Lex Titia, aprobada por la Asamblea el 23 de noviembre del 43 adC, la cual otorgaba virtualmente todos

2 CONT <p>La muerte de Fulvia fue providencial, ya que la nueva reconciliación entre los triunviros fue en gran parte cimentada en el matrimonio de Antonio con Octavia, la hermana de Octaviano, en octubre d

2 CONT <p> conflictos con Octavio casándose con ella. Octavia era una hermosa e inteligente mujer que había enviudado recientemente y tenía tres niños de su primera unión. El mundo romano fue nuevamente
2 CONC  dividido, asignando esta vez África a Lépido, las pro

2 CONC  a prometer Octaviano el envío de nuevas legiones a
2 CONT <p> Oriente.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Pero Antonio era escéptico en cuanto al apoyo de Octaviano en su campaña parta, de manera que, dejando a Octavia en Roma, embarazada de su segunda hija (Antonia Menor), navegó hacia Alejandría.
2 CONC  Allí se reunió con su antigua amante Cleopatra, madr
2 CONT <p>e de sus dos hijos gemelos, quien le prestó el dinero necesario para reunir un ejército con el que emprender la campaña parta.</p>

2 CONT <p>Tras reunir un importante ejército, estimado en unos 120.000 combatientes, Marco Antonio llevó a cabo el plan de ataque, que consistía en invadir el territorio parto, no directamente a través d
2 CONC e Mesopotamia, sino internándose en Armenia siguiendo
2 CONT <p> el Éufrates y pasando por Arzen, para someterla y contar así con la obligada ayuda del rey armenio Artavasdes. Sin embargo, Antonio cometió el error de no dejar guarniciones en el territorio ar

2 CONT <p>Mientras tanto, en Roma, el triunvirato estaba a punto de llegar a su fin. Lépido fue obligado a renunciar al cargo tras una maniobra política desafortunada, y Octaviano, sólo ahora en elpoder e

2 CONT <p>acia romana de su parte, contrayendo matrimonio con Livia.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ante la petición de Antonio (recurriendo al tratado de Tarento) para que le suministrara veteranos de las legiones establecidas en la Galia tras las importantes bajas sufridas en la campaña parta
2 CONC , Octaviano vio por fin la oportunidad de dejar a s

2 CONC y le envió tan sólo 2.000 veteranos, junto con Octavia.
2 CONT <p> Al ver el escaso contingente enviado por Octaviano, Antonio comprendió que sus intenciones pasaban por iniciar un nuevo conflicto civil, por lo que aceptó las escasas tropas recibidas y repudió
2 CONC  a su esposa, enviándola de vuelta a Roma.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>De esta forma, Octaviano obtuvo la excusa que buscaba y que había provocado, y empezó a acusar a Antonio para así alejarlo cada vez más del poder político, argumentando que Antonio era unhombr
2 CONC e de moral baja, y que había abandonado a su fiel esp
2 CONT <p>osa y a su hijos para estar con la promiscua reina de Egipto. Entre todas estas acusaciones, quizás la más grave a los ojos del pueblo fuera la de que Antonio se alejaba de las costumbresromanas

2 CONT <p> hijo de Cleopatra y de César) como corregente y subordinado a su madre, y que fue también nombrado Rey de Reyes y Rey de Egipto, a la vez que se le anunciaba como el hijo y heredero legítimo de
2 CONC  César. Estas proclamaciones fueron conocidas como l
2 CONT <p>as donaciones de Alejandría, y fueron la causa de la ruptura definitiva en las relaciones de Antonio con Roma.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Para Octaviano, el hecho de que Antonio distribuyera territorios entre sus propios descendientes (aunque fueran insignificantes o no conquistados aún) no había sido una maniobra que pudiera consi
2 CONC derar precisamente como pacífica, pero lo que más l
2 CONT <p>e inquietaba era el hecho de que Cesarión hubiera sido anunciado como el hijo legítimo de César y su heredero. El poder de Octaviano descansaba fundamentalmente en el hecho de ser considerado co

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Entre el 33 al 32 adC se desató una auténtica guerra propagandística en la arena política de Roma, con acusaciones lanzadas entre ambos bandos. Desde Egipto, Antonio anunció su divorcio de Oct
2 CONC avia, acusando a su hermano de advenedizo, de usurpado
2 CONT <p>r del poder político y de falsificar los documentos de adopción de Julio César. Octaviano replicó con cargos de traición contra Antonio: controlar ilegalmente provincias que deberían haber si
2 CONC do asignadas a otros cargos como dictaba la tradición r
2 CONT <p>omana, e iniciar guerras contra otras naciones (Partia y Armenia) sin el permiso del Senado. Antonio fue también señalado como responsable de la ejecución de Sexto Pompeyo, que había sidocaptur
2 CONC ado el año 35 adC en Mileto, en la zona de influenci
2 CONT <p>a de Antonio, y ejecutado sin juicio pese a ser ciudadano romano. Finalmente, Octaviano logró hacerse con el testamento de Antonio, guardado por las vestales, en el cual se ratificaban los temores
2 CONC  de Octaviano tal como los presentó ante el pueblo
2 CONT <p>, haciendo ver que Antonio quería reinar junto con Cleopatra en los territorios orientales romanos a toda costa, constituyendo una grave amenaza para el estado romano. De esta forma, en el año 32
2 CONC  adC el Senado despojó a Antonio de sus poderes y d
2 CONT <p>eclaró la guerra a Cleopatra.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>La guerra dio comienzo finalmente en el 31 adC. El hábil Marco Vipsanio Agripa, leal comandante a las órdenes de Octaviano, consiguió tomar la importante ciudad y puerto griego de Methone, fiel 
2 CONC a Antonio, asegurándose así un importante puerto en
2 CONT <p> el Peloponeso que amenazar las intenciones de Antonio por controlar la importante Vía Egnatia. La gran popularidad de Octaviano y sus legiones causó la defección de Cirenaica y Grecia hacia su 
2 CONC bando. Finalmente, tras una serie de operaciones ter
2 CONT <p>restres, Octaviano bloqueó a Antonio y le obligó a entablar combate en el mar. El 2 de septiembre se libró la batalla naval de Accio, en la cual la flota de Antonio y Cleopatra fue vencida por l
2 CONC a de Octaviano, retirándose ambos con sus navíos res
2 CONT <p>tantes de vuelta a Alejandría.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Octaviano, ahora ya próximo a obtener el poder absoluto, no tenía intención de dejarle un momento de paz, y a finales de julio del año 30 adC, asistido por Agripa, invadió Egipto. Sin otro lug

2 CONT <p>e hacer frente a la invasión con sus once legiones, que desertaron el día 1 de agosto tras tan sólo un día de resistencia. Obligado por las circunstancias, y en la creencia de que Cleopatra se

2 CONT <p>--------------------</p>
2 CONT <p>Mark Antony, Marcus Antonius, General of Rome, was born January 14, 83 BC, Roma, Italy; died August 1, 30 BC, Alexandria, Egypt (suicide). Roman statesman and general, who defeated the assassins of
2 CONC  Julius Caesar and, with Gaius Octavius and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, formed the Second Triumvirate, which ultimately secured the end of the Roman Republic.  Antony was born in Rome and educated for a 
2 CONC short time in Greece. From 58 to 56 bc he served as a leader of cavalry in Roman campaigns in Palestine and Egypt, and from 54 to 50 bc he served in Gaul under Julius Caesar. Subsequently, with Caesar
2 CONC 's aid, he attained the offices of quaestor, augur, and tribune of the people. At the outbreak of the civil war between Caesar and the Roman soldier and statesman Pompey the Great, Antony was appointe
2 CONC d Caesar's commander in chief in Italy. He commanded the left wing of Caesar's army at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 bc, and in 44 bc he shared the consulship with Caesar.  After the assassination of 
2 CONC Caesar in 44 bc, Antony's skillful oratory, immortalized by Shakespeare in the play Julius Caesar, turned the Roman people against the conspirators, leaving Antony for a time with almost absolute powe
2 CONC r in Rome. A rival soon appeared, however, in the person of Gaius Octavius, later the Roman emperor Augustus, who was grandnephew of Caesar and Caesar's designated heir. A struggle for power broke out
2 CONC  when Antony, Octavius, and a third contender for the throne, the Roman general Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, formed the Second Triumvirate and agreed to divide the Roman Empire among themselves.  In 42 bc
2 CONC , at Philippi, the triumvirate crushed the forces led by two assassins of Caesar, the Roman statesmen Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus, who sought to restore the Roman Republic. Later i
2 CONC n the same year, Antony summoned the Egyptian queen Cleopatra to attend him in the city of Tarsus, in Cilicia (now in Turkey), and explain her refusal to aid the triumvirate in the civil war. Instead 
2 CONC of punishing Cleopatra, however, Antony fell in love with her and returned with her to Egypt in 41 bc. In 40 bc he attended meetings of the triumvirate in Italy, at which a new division of the Roman w
2 CONC orld was arranged, with Antony receiving the eastern portion, from the Adriatic Sea to the Euphrates River; in the same year he attempted to cement his relations with Octavius by marrying the latter's
2 CONC  sister Octavia. Nevertheless, Antony soon returned to Egypt and resumed his life with Cleopatra. Octavius made use of this fact to excite the indignation of the Roman people against Antony. When, in 
2 CONC 36 bc, Antony was defeated in a military expedition against the Parthians, popular disapproval of his conduct deepened in Rome, and a new civil war became inevitable. In 31 bc the forces of Antony and
2 CONC  Cleopatra were decisively defeated by those of Octavius in a naval engagement near Actium. The couple returned to Egypt, deserted by the Egyptian fleet and by most of Antony's own army. In the follow
2 CONC ing year, besieged by the troops of Octavius in Alexandria and deceived by a false report of Cleopatra's suicide, Antony killed himself by falling on his sword.  Mark Antony (who had long been Caesar'
2 CONC s right-hand man and was consul along with Caesar in 44) soon took charge of matters, leaving Lepidus to depart for Gaul. Antony was in nominal control of state affairs, but virtually everyone was on 
2 CONC eggshells. Antony wielded a good deal of power as consul and as Caesar's second in command, but enjoyed little personal authority and dared not assert himself too strongly, lest he meet a fate similar
2 CONC  to that of Caesar. The Senate, on the other hand, was concerned about popular reaction to Caesar's death, particularly on the part of Caesar's veterans. Most importantly, the official constitutional 
2 CONC machinery, although it had continued to operate during the turbulent years 49-44, had been a virtual dead letter under Caesar's rule: his death created a vacuum in which no one quite knew how to behav
2 CONC e. An uneasy truce was arrived at. An official amnesty was granted to the conspirators, but Antony's speech at Caesar's funeral -- along with the generous gifts to the plebs included in the terms of C
2 CONC aesar's will -- so stirred the urban mob that a riot ensued and the conspirators fled Rome in fear for their safety. [Caesar's funeral is the occasion for the famous speech in Shakespeare's play: "I h
2 CONC ave come to bury Caesar, not to praise him...."] Antony then quickly retrieved Caesar's private papers from his widow and employed them to govern in Caesar's name, claiming to find there Caesar's plan
2 CONC s for Rome's future. This charade soon wore thin with the Senate, all the more so due to Antony's high-handed manner and his wanton extravagance.  Octavian and Antony. When Caesar's will was read, how
2 CONC ever, Antony received a nasty shock. In it Caesar named as his chief heir a virtual Unknown by the name of *C. Octavius, adopting him (posthumously) as his son. Octavius was Caesar's grand-nephew on h
2 CONC is sister's side, a rather sickly 18-year-old with only limited political and military experience. Upon his adoption, Octavius became *C. Julius Caesar Octavianus (or, in English, simply Octavian). An
2 CONC tony might well have expected little trouble in dealing with a youth of so little experience, few political connections, and virtually no personal authority. Unfortunately, Antony failed to recognize 
2 CONC that in Octavian he was dealing with a natural born politician. Octavian never was an imposing figure physically, and he owed his military victories largely to the skill of his able lieutenants. In th
2 CONC e political realm, however, he was without peer, rising from a virtual Unknown in 44 B.C. to become the first of the Julio-Claudian emperors by 27 AD. Tensions immediately arose between Octavian and A
2 CONC ntony, as each vied for the right to employ Caesar's substantial financial resources, to call upon the loyalty of his troops, and, above all, to invoke the authority of Caesar's name. On the one hand 
2 CONC was Antony, Caesar's second in command who had served him so ably since the 50s, who had been named magister equitum under Caesar, and who had been appointed priest (flamen) in Caesar's honor; on the 
2 CONC other was Octavian, who could claim to be Caesar's son and heir. Tensions between the two soon reached the boiling point, only to be checked by senior officers in command of Caesar's troops, who were 
2 CONC united by their common loyalty to the dead Caesar and were unwilling to fight against one another in the name of Caesar's bickering heirs. By the middle of 44 B.C. an uneasy truce was established betw
2 CONC een Antony, Octavian, the Senate, and those involved in Caesar's assassination.  Unfortunately Antony, while an able commander, was no Caesar when it came to the delicate art of politics. In 44-43 he 
2 CONC soon alienated virtually all of the other factions listed above, uniting them against him. He began by foolishly attacking the orator and statesman Cicero, a leader of the senatorial faction (the opti
2 CONC mates). These personal attacks led Cicero to denounce Antony in a series of damning speeches, known as the *Philippics.  Not content with alienating Cicero and the Senate, Antony renewed his attacks a
2 CONC gainst Octavian, charging him with plots against his (Antony's) life. Octavian saw that his position in Rome was far from secure and withdrew to central Italy, where he began to raise troops on his au
2 CONC thority as Caesar's son and heir.  At the end of 44, Antony stepped over the line altogether. As consul in 44 he had been assigned the province of Macedonia for 43. Antony realized, however, that depa
2 CONC rting from Rome at this particular juncture would be political suicide and so passed a law that awarded him a five-year command in Cisalpine Gaul and Gallia Comata (Gaul proper) instead.  This would a
2 CONC llow him to keep tabs on affairs in Rome and had the added advantage of providing him with an army camped just north of Italy. (Clearly Antony had the precedent of Caesar's own career in mind.) The th
2 CONC reat now posed by Octavian led Antony to speed up his plans: he decided to proceed to Cisalpine Gaul and assume command of his new provinces early. At this point the Senate was still unwilling to defy
2 CONC  Antony too openly, but it did direct the current governor of Cisalpine Gaul, D. Junius Brutus Albinus (who had been involved in the conspiracy against Caesar), to maintain his position. When matters 
2 CONC reached a crisis the Senate, at Cicero's urging, turned to Octavian for help. Octavian had his own forces; more importantly, he could invoke the name of Caesar, thus undercutting Antony's claims to re
2 CONC present Caesar's legacy. Cicero hoped that the young Octavian would be malleable -- a tool that the Senate could employ and then discard at its will. The plan was to have Octavian support the consuls 
2 CONC for 43 (A. Hirtius and C. Vibius Pansa) in driving Antony off, then to have Octavian surrender his troops to Brutus, the lawful governor of the region. The first part of the plan worked: Antony was co
2 CONC mpelled to retire further into Gaul, where he joined up with Lepidus (see above). Unfortunately for Cicero and the Senate, however, Octavian was neither malleable nor stupid. He realized that, were he
2 CONC  to surrender his troops to Brutus, he would not only lose an important bargaining chip but, given Brutus' association with Caesar's murder, would fatally undermine his claims to be Caesar's loyal son
2 CONC . As it happened, through one of those twists of fate that seem to occur so often in Roman history, the two consuls Hirtius and Pansa had been killed in the battle against Antony: Octavian saw a vacuu
2 CONC m and marched south with his forces, determined to fill it. Confronted with Octavian's troops, the Senate was compelled to allow him to run for the office of consul, to which he was duly elected for t
2 CONC he year 42. His adoption by Caesar was officially ratified and Caesar's assassins outlawed: thus Octavian could assume the role of the loyal son attempting to avenge his father's murder and continue h
2 CONC is father's work in "reforming" the state. (The leaders of the opposition to Caesar, M. Junius Brutus and C. Cassius Longinus, had already fled to the East, planning, like Pompey earlier, to raise tro
2 CONC ops and challenge Antony and Octavian.)  The Second Triumvirate. Suddenly Octavian was no longer a youthful outsider but a major force with which to reckon. He realized, however, that his own position
2 CONC  vis a vis the Senate was far from secure and decided to make common cause with his former enemy, Antony. Thus, in 43, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus were officially appointed as a panel of three (a tr
2 CONC iumvirate) to govern Rome with consular authority for a period of five years for the purpose of restoring constitutional order. This alliance is known as the *Second Triumvirate. Through a curious twi
2 CONC st of fate, Caesar who originally had been viewed as a dangerous, power-seeking popularis and a traitor -- now became the beloved leader whose legacy was being threatened and in whose name Octavian, A
2 CONC ntony, and Lepidus must seize control of state affairs.  Despite its official standing, the Second Triumvirate was in reality a military junta. Following the precedent of Sulla, its first order of bus
2 CONC iness was to pay back its political enemies and raise some much-needed cash (necessary if the junta's troops were to be kept happy). Proscriptions were held in which some 300 senators and 2000 equites
2 CONC  were dispatched, as much for their property as for their political sympathies. The most famous victim was Cicero, whose head and hands were cut off and hung from the speaker's platform (the Rostra) i
2 CONC n the forum. [The Triumvirate also raised taxes, aiming first (as was the Romans' won't) at wealthy and "extravagant" women. This policy led to a woman named Hortensia presenting a public speech in th
2 CONC e forum in which, we are told, she sounded the now familiar theme of no taxation without representation (i.e., without granting women the franchise).  The next order of business, once matters had been
2 CONC  settled in Rome, was to deal with the forces of Brutus and Cassius in the East. The official line was that these forces were traitors to Rome, led by Caesar's assassins. Viewed objectively, however, 
2 CONC they represented one of the last hopes of the Roman Republic, fighting a cause that was utterly unrealistic -- the days when the traditional constitutional machinery could cope with the economic, soci
2 CONC al, and political realities in Rome were long past -- but noble nonetheless. The final confrontation occurred in 42 at *Philippi in Macedonia (see Map 3 in Dudley), where Brutus' and Cassius' forces w
2 CONC ere quickly defeated in a series of battles by the combined forces of Antony and Octavian. The victory led to an immediate rise in Antony's fortunes: never much of a general, Octavian had presented a 
2 CONC poor showing at Philippi, losing one important battle and spending a good deal of the time sick in his tent. For the moment, at least, Antony was very much the senior partner among the triumvirs.  Wit
2 CONC h their enemies subdued both at Rome and abroad, the two leading members of the Triumvirate soon returned to their old personal rivalries. Lepidus was quickly gotten out of the way: accused of treason
2 CONC , he was deprived of his provinces and allowed to remain a member of the Triumvirate only on sufferance. The other two triumvirs divided Rome's holdings between them: Octavian got Spain, Antony Gaul. 
2 CONC Antony, however, had larger ambitions. Encouraged by his success at Philippi, he revived Caesar's plans for a grand military campaign in the East. His intentions clearly were to follow the precedent s
2 CONC et by Sulla, Pompey, and Caesar himself: to win power, fame, and money through a series of military triumphs abroad and then return to Rome and oust his political rivals once and for all. In 41, there
2 CONC fore, he set out for the East, where he soon became entangled with the Egyptian Cleopatra.  Cleopatra VII left three children by Marcus Antonius: the twins Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene, born 
2 CONC in 40 B.C. and Ptolemy Philadelphus, born in 36 B.C. In 33 B.C. Antonius designated Alexander to be king of Armenia and overlord of Parthia and Media. He designated Ptolemy to be ruler of all Egyptian
2 CONC  possessions in Syria and Cilicia and overlord of all client-kings and dynasts west of the Euphrates, as far as the Hellespont. After the death of Antonius, both boys were taken in by Augustus's siste
2 CONC r Octavia to be raised with her own children. They appear soon after in Augustus's Triumph in Rome and thereafter disappear from history. Speculation is that both died in childhood. Cleopatra Selene w
2 CONC as married in 29 B.C. to Juba II, a Roman client-king who ruled over Numidia c30-25 B.C. and over Mauretania 25 B.C.-cA.D. 23 when he died in his mid-70s. Cleopatra had long before predeceased him, th
2 CONC ough the date is not known. They had two (known) children: Ptolemy succeeded his father as king of Mauretania in A.D. 23. In 40, he was called to Rome to appear before the Emperor Caligula. Tacitus re
2 CONC ports he had the misfortune of presenting himself wearing such a sumptious purple robe that in envy Caligula had him put to death. One simply did not appear before Caligula wearing better duds than th
2 CONC e boss. Although Ptolemy was certainly of a marriageable age, no wife or children are known, and none succeeded him as king. Ptolemy's sister Drusilla was married to Marcus Antonius Felix. Nothing has
2 CONC  survived in recorded history to point to any issue of this marriage.  Octavian, by contrast, was given the thankless task of dealing with affairs in Italy, particularly the necessity of finding land 
2 CONC for his and Antony's veterans. Antony clearly hoped that Octavian would become embroiled in Italian politics, squandering both his time and, more important, his popularity with the masses. In the end,
2 CONC  this was a poor strategy on Antony's part. Not only did his own military ventures not fare well, but, by leaving Octavian in Rome, he allowed his rival to ply his considerable political skills in wag
2 CONC ing a propaganda war against Antony.  At first, however, Antony's plan appeared to succeed. Octavian's problem was to find land for his and Antony's veterans; his solution was to confiscate land throu
2 CONC ghout Italy. The Italian cities were outraged, and this sense of outrage was encouraged by Antony's wife Fulvia and his brother L. Antonius, who incited a civil war. The rebels were suppressed through
2 CONC  a combination of Antony's delay in supporting them and the brutality of Octavian's reprisals (particularly against the city of Perusia, in the so-called Perusine War). Antony eventually returned to I
2 CONC taly in 40, landing at Brundisium, but by then Octavian had not only secured Italy but had seized Gaul. War nearly broke out between Antony and Octavian, but their troops refused to fight against one 
2 CONC another. At last a deal was cut: Antony was to pursue his ambitions in the East, while Octavian was granted the western half of Rome's empire. To cement the deal, Antony married Octavian's sister *Oct
2 CONC avia (Fulvia having died of natural causes in the meantime).  Antony accordingly returned east, where from 40-35 he was engaged in a series of largely unsuccessful campaigns against the Parthians. His
2 CONC  desperate need for financial and military support drove him into the arms of Cleopatra (literally and figuratively) and he became her official consort. Antony had 3 children by Cleopatra. In 36, desp
2 CONC ite their age (6, 6, and 2, respectively), he granted each of these children, as well as Cleopatra herself, territories in the East as their official realms; he also lent his support to the claims of 
2 CONC Caesarion (then 13 years old) to be Caesar's true son and heir. To Roman eyes these moves were troubling, suggesting that Antony was becoming a champion of Egypt and its oriental queen.  Meanwhile, Oc
2 CONC tavian was busy in the West fighting *Sextus Pompeius, a son of Pompey the Great. Sextus had gathered the last of the Republican opposition about him in Spain and by 42 controlled Sicily. With his fle
2 CONC et, Sextus was able to harass Roman shipping, nearly cutting off Rome's grain supplies. To the degree that Sextus could claim to be fighting for the cause of his father, Pompey, he represented the las
2 CONC t forces of the old Republic; in reality, he was as much a military overlord/adventurer as Antony and Octavian. Octavian once again showed his lack of military experience, suffering a series of humili
2 CONC ating defeats, and, in 38, was forced to meet with Antony in order to ask for reinforcements. (At the same time the term of the Triumvirate, originally slated to expire in 38, was extended for another
2 CONC  five years.) In 36 Octavian -- or, rather, his general *M. Vipsanius Agrippa, working in tandem with Lepidus -- finally defeated Sextus at the battle of Naulochus. Lepidus made an attempt to seize Si
2 CONC cily for himself, but was soon deserted by his supporters and captured. As pontifex maximus Lepidus could not be killed (as we shall see, Octavian was beginning to develop scruples!), so he was merely
2 CONC  stripped of his official powers and placed under permanent house arrest in Rome.  Actium. The year 36 marks something of a turning point in Octavian's career. From this point on he began to doff the 
2 CONC role of ruthless military warlord and instead present himself as a defender of the Republic (such as it was!). This strategy was to stand him in good stead in the propaganda war against Antony. Antony
2 CONC , Octavian could claim, had become the thrall of a depraved eastern monarch: he had "gone native" and (Octavian claimed) planned to reduce Rome to a mere subject state, transferring the capital of the
2 CONC  empire to Egypt. The Romans would be slaves to a mongrel horde of oriental eunuchs and their lascivious queen, compelled to worship Egypt's decadent, bestial gods and to adopt the perverse religious 
2 CONC practices of a land whose rulers regularly married their own siblings.  Tensions between Antony and Octavian began to reach a head in 35, when Antony formally repudiated Octavia, who had remained loya
2 CONC l to him despite the repeated humiliation to which he had subjected her. In 33, when the Triumvirate officially expired, Octavian held the consulship: he was then able to present Antony as a private R
2 CONC oman citizen acting without the authority of the state and to contrast his own position as loyal servant of the Republic. There followed, in 32, the public reading of Antony's will (which, according t
2 CONC o custom, had been deposited in Rome for safe keeping): the provisions it contained were not outrageous -- for example, Antony asked to be buried with Cleopatra and requested official recognition for 
2 CONC his children by Cleopatra and for Caesarion but they furthered the impression that Antony now regarded himself as an Egyptian.  n the end war was inevitable. The issue was decided in 31 at the naval b
2 CONC attle of *Actium (in northwest Greece). Antony had established camp in the bay of Actium in late 32, hoping to use it as a base of operations against Octavian. He became mired there, however, his line
2 CONC s of supply cut off and his forces steadily shrinking due to disease and desertion. As time wore on, his troops became ever more demoralized, in part due to the presence of Cleopatra in their camp: Ro
2 CONC man soldiers did not like the idea of being the servants of a foreign queen (think of Livy's portrayal of Tanaquil). Moreover, Antony's Egyptian fleet was outnumbered and out-generaled by Octavian's f
2 CONC leet, led by Agrippa. By September of 31 Antony had realized that his position was untenable and attempted to slip away with his fleet to Asia Minor. His plans were poorly executed by his demoralized 
2 CONC troops, however, and only Cleopatra's ships managed to escape, followed by Antony with a few Roman stragglers. The remainder of Antony's forces surrendered after only token resistance. The battle of A
2 CONC ctium was, then, something of a fiasco: a failed tactical retreat. Octavian and his supporters, however, presented it as a glorious triumph, spreading the story that Antony, accompanied by Cleopatra, 
2 CONC had intended a full-scale naval battle but had turned tail and deserted his troops when he saw Cleopatra's ship fleeing in fear. In this version, Antony is betrayed by his besotted obsession with the 
2 CONC cowardly and depraved Egyptian queen.  Antony and Cleopatra fled to Egypt, where they committed suicide. Octavian, however, hailed his triumph as belonging to the Roman Senate and people a victory for
2 CONC  Rome's political and religious traditions over a nefarious threat from the decadent East. (Notice that once again Octavian held the consulship his third in this crucial year, allowing him once more t
2 CONC o present himself as the servant of the Roman people fighting in defense of the Republic, rather than as a military despot intent on wiping out a hated rival.) He claimed to have been supported in thi
2 CONC s victory by the god *Apollo, who had a small temple on a nearby promontory. Apollo, the god of Actium, became a prominent figure in Octavian/Augustus' reign. A god of poetry, music, and culture, he p
2 CONC rovided a fitting contrast to the "degenerate" Egyptian culture championed by Antony. He also embodied two contrary features that Octavian found useful, for Apollo was both a powerful god of retributi
2 CONC on, smiting those who strayed beyond the proper bounds set for mortal ambitions, and a gentle god of refinement and culture. (These two contrasting features are symbolized by two of Apollo's attribute
2 CONC s: the bow and the lyre.) As we shall see, the poets and artists who celebrated Octavian/Augustus' achievements presented his career as displaying these same two contrasting features, with Actium as t
2 CONC he turning point. Before Actium, we find the stern triumvir who employs violence to punish his father's murderers, restore "order" to Italy, and check the wild ambitions of Antony and Cleopatra; after
2 CONC  Actium, we find the benign ruler who oversees a political, moral, and cultural renaissance at Rome.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Marcus Antonius (Latin: M·ANTONIVS·M·F·M·N; January 14, 83 BC-August 1, 30 BC), commonly known in English as Mark or Marc Antony, was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role 
2 CONC in the transformation of the Roman Republic from an oligarchy into the autocratic Roman Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony was a supporter of Julius Caesar, and served as one of his generals during the conquest of Gaul and the Civil War. Antony was appointed administrator of Italy while Caesar eliminated politic
2 CONC al opponents in Greece, North Africa, and Spain. After Caesar's death in 44 BC, Antony joined forces with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, another of Caesar's generals, and Octavian, Caesar's nephew and adopt
2 CONC ed son, forming a three-man dictatorship known to historians as the Second Triumvirate. The Triumvirs defeated Caesar's murderers, the Liberatores, at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, and divided the 
2 CONC government of the Republic between themselves. Antony was assigned Rome's eastern provinces, including the client kingdom of Egypt, then ruled by Cleopatra VII Philopator, and was given the command in
2 CONC  Rome's war against Parthia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Relations among the Triumvirs were strained as the various members sought greater political power. Civil war between Antony and Octavian was averted in 40 BC, when Antony married Octavian's sister,
2 CONC  Octavia. Despite this marriage, Antony carried on a love affair with Cleopatra, who bore him three children, further straining Antony's relations with Octavian. Lepidus was expelled from the associat
2 CONC ion in 36 BC, and in 33 BC disagreements between Antony and Octavian caused a split between the remaining Triumvirs. Their ongoing hostility erupted into civil war in 31 BC, as the Roman Senate, at Oc
2 CONC tavian's direction, declared war on Cleopatra and proclaimed Antony a traitor. Later that year, Antony was defeated by Octavian's forces at the Battle of Actium. Defeated, Antony and Cleopatra fled to
2 CONC  Egypt, where they committed suicide.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>With Antony dead, Octavian was the undisputed master of the Roman world. In 27 BC, he was granted the title of Augustus, marking the final stage in the transformation of the Roman Republic into an

2 CONT <p>'''Early life'''</p>
2 CONT <p>----</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A member of the plebeian Antonia gens, Antony was born in Rome on January 14, 83 BC. His father and namesake was Marcus Antonius Creticus, son of the noted orator by the same name who had been murd
2 CONC ered during the Marian Terror of the winter of 87–86 BC. His mother was Julia Antonia, a distant cousin of Julius Caesar. Antony was an infant at the time of Lucius Cornelius Sulla's march on Rome i
2 CONC n 82 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to the Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero, Antony's father was incompetent and corrupt, and was only given power because he was incapable of using or abusing it effectively. In 74 BC he w
2 CONC as given military command to defeat the pirates of the Mediterranean, but he died in Crete in 71 BC without making any significant progress. The elder Antony's death left Antony and his brothers, Luci
2 CONC us and Gaius, in the care of their mother, Julia, who later married Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura, an eminent member of the old Patrician nobility. Lentulus, despite exploiting his political success
2 CONC  for financial gain, was constantly in debt due to the extravagance of his lifestyle. He was a major figure in the Second Catilinarian Conspiracy and was summarily executed on the orders of the Consul
2 CONC  Cicero in 63 BC for his involvement. His death resulted in a feud between the Antonia and the famous orator.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony's early life was characterized by a lack of proper parental guidance. According to the historian Plutarch, he spent his teenage years wandering through Rome with his brothers and friends gam
2 CONC bling, drinking, and becoming involved in scandalous love affairs. According to Cicero, he had a homosexual relationship with Gaius Scribonius Curio. There is little reliable information on his politi
2 CONC cal activity as a young man, although it is known that he was an associate of Publius Clodius Pulcher and his street gang. He may also have been involved in the Lupercal cult as he was referred to as 
2 CONC a priest of this order later in life. By age twenty, Antony had amassed an enormous debt. Hoping to escape his creditors, Antony fled to Greece in 58 BC, where he studied philosophy and rhetoric at At
2 CONC hens.

2 CONT <p>'''Early career'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Military service''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 57 BC, Antony joined the military staff of Aulus Gabinius, the Proconsul of Syria, as chief of the cavalry. This appointment marks the beginning of his military career. As Consul the previous ye
2 CONC ar alongside Antony's mentor Publius Clodius Pulcher, Gabinius had exiled Cicero.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hyrcanus II, the Roman-supported Hasmonean High Priest of Judea, fled Jerusalem to Gabinius to seek protection against his rival and son-in-law Alexander. Years earlier in 63 BC, the Roman general 
2 CONC Pompey had captured him and his father, King Aristobulus II, during his war against the remnant of the Seleucid Empire. Pompey had deposed Aristobulus and installed Hyrcanus as Rome’s client ruler o
2 CONC ver Judea. Antony achieved his first military distinctions after securing important victories at Alexandrium and Machaerus. With the rebellion defeated by 56 BC, Gabinius restored Hyrcanus to his posi
2 CONC tion as High Priest in Judea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The following year, in 55 BC, Gabinius intervened in the political affairs of Ptolemaic Egypt. Pharaoh Ptolemy XII Auletes had been deposed in a rebellion led by his daughter Berenice IV in 58 BC, 
2 CONC forcing him to seek asylum in Rome. During Pompey’s conquests years earlier, Ptolemy had received the support of Pompey, who named him an ally of Rome. Gabinius’ invasion sought to restore Ptolemy
2 CONC  to his throne. This was done against the orders of the Senate but with the approval of Pompey, then Rome’s leading politician, and only after the deposed king provided a 10,000 talent bribe. The Gr
2 CONC eek historian Plutarch records it was Antony who convinced Gabinius to finally act. After defeating the frontier forces of the Egyptian kingdom, Gabinius's army proceeded to attack the palace guards b
2 CONC ut they surrendered before a battle commenced. With Ptolemy XII restored as Rome’s client king, Gabinius garrisoned two thousand Roman soldiers, later known as the Gabiniani, in Alexandria to ensure
2 CONC  Ptolemy’s authority. In return for its support, Rome exercised considerable power over the kingdom’s affairs, particularly control of the kingdom’s revenues and crop yields.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the campaign in Egypt, Antony first met Cleopatra, the 14-year-old daughter of Ptolemy XII. Roman historian Appian of Alexandria later recorded Antony's desire for the Egyptian princess bega
2 CONC n at this meeting.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>While Antony was serving Gabinius in the East, the domestic political situation had changed in Rome. In 60 BC, a secret agreement (known as the "First Triumvirate") was entered into between three m
2 CONC en to control the Republic: Marcus Licinius Crassus, Gnaeus Pompey Magnus, and Gaius Julius Caesar. Crassus, Rome's wealthiest man, had defeated the slave rebellion of Spartacus in 70 BC; Pompey conqu
2 CONC ered much of the Eastern Mediterranean in the 60's BC; Caesar was Rome's Pontifex Maximus and a former general in Spain. In 59 BC, Caesar, with funding from Crassus, was elected Consul to pursue legis
2 CONC lation favorable to Crassus and Pompey's interests. In return, Caesar was assigned the governorship of Illyricum, Cisalpine Gaul, and Transalpine Gaul for five years beginning in 58 BC. Caesar used hi
2 CONC s governorship as a launching point for his conquest of free Gaul. In 55 BC, Crassus and Pompey served as Consuls while Caesar's command was extended for another five years. Rome was effectively under
2 CONC  the absolute power of these three men. The Triumvirate used the demagogue Publius Clodius Pulcher, Antony's patron, to exile their political rivals, notably Cicero and Cato the Younger.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During his early military service, Antony married his cousin Antonia Hybrida Minor, the daughter of Gaius Antonius Hybrida. Sometime between 54 and 30 BC, the union produced a single daughter, Anto
2 CONC nia Prima. It is unclear if this was Antony's first marriage.

2 CONT <p>''Service under Caesar''</p>
2 CONT <p>''Gallic Wars''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony's association with Publius Clodius Pulcher allowed him to achieve greater prominence. Clodius, through the influence of his benefactor Marcus Licinius Crassus, had developed a positive polit
2 CONC ical relationship with Julius Caesar. Clodius secured Antony a position on Caesar's military staff in 54 BC, joining his conquest of Gaul. Serving under Caesar, Antony demonstrated excellent military 
2 CONC leadership. Despite a temporary alienation later in life, Antony and Caesar developed friendly relations which would continue until Caesar's assassination in 44 BC. Caesar's influence secured greater 
2 CONC political advancement for Antony. After a year of service in Gaul, Caesar dispatched Antony to Rome to formally begin his political career, receiving election as Quaestor for 52 BC as a member of the 
2 CONC Populares faction. Assigned to assist Caesar, Antony returned to Gaul and commanded Caesar's cavalry during his victory at the Battle of Alesia against the Gallic High King Vercingetorix. Following hi
2 CONC s year in office, Antony was promoted by Caesar to the rank of Legate and assigned command of two legions (approximately 7,500 total soldiers).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During this time, the alliance between Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus had effectively ended. Caesar's daughter Julia, who had married Pompey to secure the alliance, died in 54 BC while Crassus was kil
2 CONC led at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC. Without the stability they provided, the divide between Caesar and Pompey grew ever larger. Caesar's glory in conquering Gaul had served to further strain his al
2 CONC liance with Pompey, who, having grown jealous of his former ally, had drifted away from Caesar's democratic Populares party towards the oligarchic Optimates faction led by Cato. The supporters of Caes

2 CONC enate meeting house, the Curia Hostilia, by Clodius' street gang. Anarchy resulted, causing the Senate to look to Pompey. Fearing the persecutions of Lucius Cornelius Sulla only thirty-years earlier, 
2 CONC they avoided granting Pompey the dictatorship by instead naming him sole Consul for the year, giving him extraordinary but limited powers. Pompey ordered armed soldiers into the city to restore order

2 CONT <p>Antony remained on Caesar's military staff until 50 BC, helping mopping-up actions across Gaul to secure Caesar's conquest. With the war over, Antony was sent back to Rome to act as Caesar's protec
2 CONC tor against Pompey and the other Optimates. With the support of Caesar, who as Pontifex Maximus was head of the Roman religion, Antony was appointed the College of Augurs, an important priestly office
2 CONC  responsible for interpreting the will of the Roman gods by studying the flight of birds. All public actions required favorable auspices, granting the college considerable influence. Antony was then e
2 CONC lected as one of the ten People's Tribunes for 49 BC. In this position, Antony could protect Caesar from his political enemies by vetoing any actions unfavorable to his patron.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The feud between Caesar and Pompey erupted into open confrontation by early 49 BC. The Consuls for the year, Gaius Claudius Marcellus Maior and Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Crus, were firm Optimates o
2 CONC pposed to Caesar. Pompey, though remaining in Rome, was then serving as the governor of Spain and commanded several legions. Upon assuming office in January, Antony immediately summoned a meeting of t
2 CONC he Senate to resolve the conflict: he proposed both Caesar and Pompey lay down their commands and return to the status of mere private citizens. His proposal was well received by most of the senators 
2 CONC but the Consuls and Cato vehemently opposed it. Antony then made a new proposal: Caesar would retain only two of his eight legions and the governorship of Illyrium if he was allowed to stand for the C
2 CONC onsulship in absentia. This arrangement ensured his immunity from suit would continue, he had needed the Consulship to protect himself from prosecution by Pompey. Though Pompey found the concession sa
2 CONC tisfactory, Cato and Lentulus refused to back down, with Lentulus even expelling Antony from the Senate meeting by force. Antony fled Rome, fearing for his life, and returned to Caesar's camp on the b
2 CONC anks of the Rubicon River, the southern limit of Caesar's lawful command.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Within days of Antony's expulsion, on 7 January 49 BC, the Senate reconvened. Under the leadership of Cato and with the tacit support of Pompey, the Senate passed the “final decree” (senatus co
2 CONC nsultum ultimum) stripping Caesar of his command and ordering him to return to Rome and stand trial for war crimes. The Senate further declared Caesar a traitor and a public enemy if he did not immedi
2 CONC ately disband his army. With all hopes of finding a peaceful solution gone after Antony's expulsion, Caesar used Antony as a pretext for marching on Rome. As Tribune, Antony's person was sacrosanct an
2 CONC d therefore it was unlawful to harm him or refuse to recognize his veto. Three days later, on 10 January, Caesar crossed the Rubicon River, starting a civil war. During the southern march, Caesar plac
2 CONC ed Antony as his second in command.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Caesar's rapid advance surprised Pompey, who, along with the other chief members of the Optimates, fled Italy for Greece. After entering Rome, instead of pursuing Pompey, Caesar marched to Spain to
2 CONC  defeat Pompeian-loyalists there. Meanwhile, Antony, with the rank of Propraetor despite never having served as Praetor, was installed as governor of Italy and commander of the army, stationed there w
2 CONC hile Marcus Lepidus, one of Caesar's staff officers, ran the provisional administration of Rome itself. Though Antony was well liked by his soldiers, most other citizens despised him for his lack of i
2 CONC nterest in the hardships they faced from the civil war.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By the end of the year 49 BC, Caesar, already the ruler of Gaul, had captured Italy, Spain, Sicily, and Sardinia out of Optimates control. In early 48 BC, he prepared to sail with seven legions to 
2 CONC Greece to face Pompey. Caesar had entrusted the defense of Illyricum to Gaius Antonius, Antony's younger brother, and Publius Cornelius Dolabella. Pompey's forces, however, defeated them and assumed c
2 CONC ontrol of the Adriatic Sea along with it. Additionally, the two legions they commanded defected to Pompey. Without their fleet, Caesar lacked the necessary transport ships to cross into Greece with hi
2 CONC s seven legions. Instead, he sailed with only two and placed Antony in command of the remaining five at Brundisium with instructions to join him as soon as he was able. In early 48 BC, Lucius Scriboni
2 CONC us Libo was given command of Pompey's fleet, comprising some fifty galleys. Moving off to Brundisium, he blockaded Antony. Antony, however, managed to trick Libo into pursuing some decoy ships, causin
2 CONC g Libo’s squadron to be trapped and attacked. Most of Libo’s fleet managed to escape, but several of his troops were trapped and captured. With Libo gone, Antony joined Caesar in Greece by March 4
2 CONC 8 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the Greek campaign, Plutarch records Antony was Caesar's top general and second to only him in reputation. Antony joined Caesar at the western Balkan Peninsula and besieged Pompey's larger a
2 CONC rmy at Dyrrhachium. With food sources running low, Caesar, in July, ordered a nocturnal assault on Pompey's camp, but Pompey's larger forces pushed back the assault. Though an indecisive result, the v
2 CONC ictory was a tactical win for Pompey. Pompey, however, did not order a counter-assault on Caesar's camp, allowing Caesar to retreat unhindered. Caesar would later remark the civil war would have ended
2 CONC  that day if Pompey had only attacked him. Caesar managed to retreat to Thessaly, with Pompey in pursuit.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Assuming a defensive position at the plain of Pharsalus, Caesar's army prepared for pitched battle with Pompey's, which outnumbered his own two to one. At the Battle of Pharsalus on 9 August 48 BC,
2 CONC  Caesar commanded the right wing opposite Pompey while Antony commanded the left, indicating Antony's status as Caesar's top general. The resulting battle was a decisive victory for Caesar. Though the
2 CONC  civil war had not ended at Pharsulus, the battle marked the pinnacle of Caesar's power and effectively ended the Republic. The battle gave Caesar a much needed boost in legitimacy, as prior to the ba
2 CONC ttle much of the Roman world outside Italy supported Pompey and the Optimates as the legitimate government of Rome. After Pompey's defeat, most of the Senate defected to Caesar, including many of the 
2 CONC soldiers who had fought under Pompey. Pompey himself fled to Ptolemaic Egypt, but Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator feared retribution from Caesar and had Pompey assassinated upon his arrival.

2 CONT <p>Instead of immediately pursuing Pompey and the remaining Optimates, Caesar returned to Rome and was appointed Dictator with Antony as his Master of the Horse and second in command. Caesar presided 
2 CONC over his own election to a second Consulship for 47 BC and then, after eleven days in office, resigned this dictatorship. Caesar then sailed to Egypt, where he deposed Ptolemy XIII in favor of his sis
2 CONC ter Cleopatra in 47 BC. The young Cleopatra became Caesar's mistress and bore him a son, Caesarion. Caesar's actions further strengthened Roman control over the already Roman-dominated kingdom.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>While Caesar was away in Egypt, Antony remained in Rome to govern Italy and restore order.] Without Caesar to guide him, however, Antony quickly faced political difficulties and proved himself unpo
2 CONC pular. The chief cause of his political challenges concerned debt forgiveness. One of the Tribunes for 47 BC, Publius Cornelius Dolabella, a former general under Pompey, proposed a law which would hav
2 CONC e canceled all outstanding debts. Antony opposed the law for political and personal reasons: he believed Caesar would not support such massive relief and suspected Dolabella had seduced his wife Anton
2 CONC ia Hybrida Minor. When Dolabella sought to enact the law by force and seized the Roman Forum, Antony responded by unleashing his soldiers upon the assembled mass. The resulting instability, especially
2 CONC  among Caesar's veterans who would have benefited from the law, forced Caesar to return to Italy by October 47 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony's handling of the affair with Dolabella caused a cooling of his relationship with Caesar. Antony's violent reaction had caused Rome to fall into a state of anarchy. Caesar sought to mend rel
2 CONC ations with the populist leader; he was elected to a third term as Consul for 46 BC, but proposed the Senate should transfer the consulship to Dolabella. When Antony protested, Caesar was forced to wi
2 CONC thdraw the motion out of shame. Later, Caesar sought to exercise his prerogatives as Dictator and directly proclaim Dolabella as Consul instead. Antony again protested and, in his capacity as an Augur
2 CONC , declared the omens were unfavorable and Caesar again backed down. Seeing the expediency of removing Dolabella from Rome, Caesar ultimately pardoned him for his role in the riots and took him as one 
2 CONC of his generals in his campaigns against the remaining Optimates resistance. Antony, however, was stripped of all official positions and received no appointments for the year 46 BC or 45 BC. Instead o
2 CONC f Antony, Caesar appointed Marcus Aemilius Lepidus to be his Consular colleague for 46 BC. While Caesar campaigned in North Africa, Antony remained in Rome as a mere private citizen. After returning v
2 CONC ictorious from North Africa, Caesar was appointed Dictator for ten years and brought Cleopatra and their son to Rome. Antony again remained in Rome while Caesar, in 45 BC, sailed to Spain to defeat th
2 CONC e final opposition to his rule. When Caesar returned in late 45 BC, the civil war was over.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During this time Antony married his third wife, Fulvia. Following the scandal with Dolabella, Antony had divorced his second wife and quickly married Fulvia. Fulvia had previously been married to b
2 CONC oth Publius Clodius Pulcher and Gaius Scribonius Curio, having been a widow since Curio's assassination in 52 BC. Though Antony and Fulvia were formally married in 47 BC, Cicero suggests the two had b
2 CONC een in a relationship since at least 58 BC. The union produced two children: Marcus Antonius Antyllus (b. 47) and Iullus Antonius (b. 45).

2 CONT <p>Whatever conflicts existed between himself and Caesar, Antony remained faithful to Caesar, ensuring their estrangement did not last long. Antony reunited with Caesar at Narbo in 45 BC with full rec

2 CONC n came soon after Antony rejected an offer by Gaius Trebonius, one of Caesar's generals, to join a conspiracy to assassinate Caesar.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Soon after assuming office together, the Lupercalia festival was held on 15 February 44 BC. The festival was held in honor of Lupa, the she-wolf who suckled the infant orphans Romulus and Remus, th
2 CONC e founders of Rome. The political atmosphere of Rome at the time of the festival was deeply divided. Caesar had enacted a number of constitutional reforms which centralized effectively all political p
2 CONC owers within his own hands. He was granted further honors, including a form of semi-official cult, with Antony as his high priest. Additionally, the day before the festival, Caesar had been named Dict
2 CONC ator for Life, effectively granting unlimited power. Caesar's political rivals feared these reforms were his attempts at transforming the Republic into an open monarchy. During the festival's activiti
2 CONC es, Antony publicly offered Caesar a diadem, which Caesar refused. The event presented a powerful message: a diadem was a symbol of a king. By refusing it, Caesar demonstrated he had no intention of m
2 CONC aking himself King of Rome. Antony's motive for such actions is not clear and it is unknown if he acted with Caesar's prior approval or on his own.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A group of Senators resolved to kill Caesar to prevent him from seizing the throne. Chief among them were Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus. Although Cassius was "the moving spirit" i
2 CONC n the plot, winning over the chief assassins to the cause of tyrannicide, Brutus, with his family's history of deposing Rome's kings, became their leader. Cicero, though not personally involved in the
2 CONC  conspiracy, later claimed Antony's actions sealed Caesar's fate as such an obvious display of Caesar's preeminence motivated them to act. Originally, the conspirators had planned to eliminate not onl
2 CONC y Caesar but also many of his supporters, including Antony, but Brutus rejected the proposal, limiting the conspiracy to Caesar alone. With Caesar preparing to depart for Parthia in late March, the co
2 CONC nspirators prepared to act when Caesar appeared for the Senate meeting on the Ides of March (15 March).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony, having learned of the plot the night before, went to stop Caesar from attending the meeting. However, a group of senators intercepted Caesar just as he was passing the Theater of Pompey, wh
2 CONC ere the Senate was temporarily meeting, and directed him towards the meeting before Antony could reach him. According to the Greek historian Plutarch, as Caesar arrived at the Senate, Lucius Tillius C
2 CONC imber presented him with a petition to recall his exiled brother. The other conspirators crowded round to offer their support. Within moments, the entire group, including Brutus, was striking out at t
2 CONC he dictator. Caesar attempted to get away, but, blinded by blood, he tripped and fell; the men continued stabbing him as he lay defenseless on the lower steps of the portico. According to Roman histor
2 CONC ian Eutropius, around 60 or more men participated in the assassination. Caesar was stabbed 23 times and died from the blood loss attributable to multiple stab wounds.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the turmoil surrounding the assassination, Antony escaped Rome dressed as a slave, fearing Caesar's death would be the start of a bloodbath among his supporters. When this did not occur, he soon
2 CONC  returned to Rome. The conspirators, who styled themselves the Liberatores ("The Liberators"), had barricaded themselves on the Capitoline Hill for their own safety. Though they believed Caesar's deat
2 CONC h would restore the Republic, Caesar had been immensely popular with the Roman middle and lower classes, who became enraged upon learning a small group of aristocrats had killed their champion.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony, as the sole Consul, soon took the initiative and seized the state treasury. Calpurnia Pisonis, Caesar's widow, presented him with Caesar's personal papers and custody of his extensive prope
2 CONC rty, clearly marking him as Caesar's heir and leader of the Caesarian faction. Caesar's Master of the Horse Marcus Aemilius Lepidus marched over 6,000 troops into Rome on 16 March to restore order and
2 CONC  to act as the bodyguards of the Caesarian faction. Lepidus wanted to storm the Capitol, but Antony preferred a peaceful solution as a majority of both the Liberators and Caesar's own supporters prefe
2 CONC rred a settlement over civil war. On 17 March, at Antony's arrangement, the Senate met to discuss a compromise, which, due to the presence of Caesar's veterans in the city, was quickly reached. Caesar
2 CONC 's assassins would be pardoned of their crimes and, in return, all of Caesar's actions would be ratified. In particular, the offices assigned to both Brutus and Cassius by Caesar were likewise ratifie
2 CONC d. Antony also agreed to accept the appointment of his rival Dolabella as his Consular colleague to replace Caesar. Having neither troops, money, nor popular support, the Liberatores were forced to ac
2 CONC cept Antony's proposal. This compromise was a great success for Antony, who managed to simultaneously appease Caesar's veterans, reconcile the Senate majority, and appear to the Liberatores as their p
2 CONC artner and protector.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On 19 March, Caesar's will was opened and read. In it, Caesar posthumously adopted his great-nephew Gaius Octavius and named him his principal heir. Then only 19 years old and stationed with Caesar
2 CONC 's army in Macedonia, the youth became a member of Caesar's Julian clan, changing his name to "Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus" (Octavian) in accordance with the conventions of Roman adoption. Though n
2 CONC ot the chief beneficiary, Antony did receive some bequests.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Shortly after the compromise was reached, as a sign of good faith, Brutus, against the advice of Cassius and Cicero, agreed Caesar would be given a public funeral and his will would be validated. C
2 CONC aesar's funeral was held on 20 March. Antony, as Caesar's faithful lieutenant and reigning Consul, was chosen to preside over the ceremony and to recite the elegy. During the demagogic speech, he enum
2 CONC erated the deeds of Caesar and, publicly reading his will, detailed the donations Caesar had left to the Roman people. Antony then seized the blood-stained toga from Caesar's body and presented it to 
2 CONC the crowd. Worked into a fury by the bloody spectacle, the assembly rioted. Several buildings in the Forum and some houses of the conspirators were burned to the ground. Panicked, many of the conspira
2 CONC tors fled Italy.[66] Under the pretext of not being able to guarantee their safety, Antony relieved Brutus and Cassius of their judicial duties in Rome and instead assigned them responsibility for pro
2 CONC curing wheat for Rome from Sicily and Asia. Such an assignment, in addition to being unworthy of their rank, would have kept them far from Rome and shifted the balance towards Antony. Refusing such se
2 CONC condary duties, the two traveled to Greece instead. Additionally, Cleopatra left Rome to return to Egypt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Despite the provisions of Caesar's will, Antony proceeded to act as leader of the Caesarian faction, including appropriating for himself a portion of Caesar's fortune rightfully belonging to Octavi
2 CONC an. Antony enacted the Lex Antonia, which formally abolished the Dictatorship, in an attempt to consolidate his power by gaining the support of the Senatorial class. He also enacted a number of laws h
2 CONC e claimed to have found in Caesar's papers to ensure his popularity with Caesar's veterans, particularly by providing land grants to them. Lepidus, with Antony's support, was named Pontifex Maximus to
2 CONC  succeed Caesar. To solidify the alliance between Antony and Lepidus, Antony's daughter Antonia Prima was engaged to Lepidus's son, also named Lepidus. Surrounding himself with a bodyguard of over six
2 CONC  thousand of Caesar's veterans, Antony presented himself as Caesar's true successor, largely ignoring Octavian.

2 CONT <p>''First Conflict with Octavian''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Octavian arrived in Rome in May to claim his inheritance. Although Antony had amassed political support, Octavian still had opportunity to rival him as the leading member of the Caesarian faction. 
2 CONC The Senatorial Republicans increasingly viewed Antony as a new tyrant. Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status
2 CONC . When Antony refused to relinquish Caesar's vast fortune to him, Octavian borrowed heavily to fulfill the bequests in Caesar's will to the Roman people and to his veterans, as well as to establish hi
2 CONC s own bodyguard of veterans. This earned him the support of Caesarian sympathizers who hoped to use him as a means of eliminating Antony. The Senate, and Cicero in particular, viewed Antony as the gre
2 CONC ater danger of the two. By summer 44 BC, Antony was in a difficult position due to his actions regarding his compromise with the Liberatores following Caesar's assassination. He could either denounce 
2 CONC the Liberatores as murderers and alienate the Senate or he could maintain his support for the compromise and risk betraying the legacy of Caesar, strengthening Octavian's position. In either case, his
2 CONC  situation as ruler of Rome would be weakened. Roman historian Cassius Dio later recorded that while Antony, as reigning Consul, maintained the advantage in the relationship, the general affection of 
2 CONC the Roman people was shifting to Octavian due to his status as Caesar's son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Supporting the Senatorial faction against Antony, Octavian, in September 44 BC, encouraged the leading Senator Marcus Tullius Cicero to attack Antony in a series of speeches portraying him as a thr
2 CONC eat to the Republican order. Risk of civil war between Antony and Octavian grew. Octavian continued to recruit Caesar's veterans to his side, away from Antony, with two of Antony's legions defecting i
2 CONC n November 44 BC. At that time, Octavian, only a private citizen, lacked legal authority to command the Republic's armies, making his command illegal. With popular opinion in Rome turning against him 
2 CONC and his Consular term nearing its end, Antony attempted to secure a favorable military assignment to secure an army to protect himself. The Senate, as was custom, assigned Antony and Dolabella the pro
2 CONC vinces of Macedonia and Syria, respectively, to govern in 43 BC after their Consular terms expired. Antony, however, objected to the assignment, preferring to govern Cisalpine Gaul which had been assi
2 CONC gned to Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, one of Caesar's assassins. When Decimus refused to surrender his province, Antony marched north in December 44 BC with his remaining soldiers to take the provinc
2 CONC e by force, besieging Decimus at Mutina. The Senate, led by a fiery Cicero, denounced Antony's actions and declared him an outlaw.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ratifying Octavian's extraordinary command on 1 January 43 BC, the Senate dispatched him along with Consuls Hirtius and Pansa to defeat Antony and his five legions. Antony's forces were defeated at

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>With Antony defeated, the Senate, hoping to eliminate Octavian and the remainder of the Caesarian party, assigned command of the Republic's legions to Decimus. Sextus Pompey, son of Caesar's old ri

2 CONC empted to renew the "Republican" cause. However, the eight legions serving under Octavian, composed largely of Caesar's veterans, refused to follow one of Caesar's murderers, allowing Octavian to reta
2 CONC in his command. Meanwhile, Antony recovered his position by joining forces with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, who had been assigned the governorship of Transalpine Gaul and Nearer Spain. Antony sent Lepidu
2 CONC s to Rome to broker a conciliation. Though he was an ardent Caesarian, Lepdius had maintained friendly relations with the Senate and with Sextus Pompey. His legions, however, quickly joined Antony, gi
2 CONC ving him control over seventeen legions, the largest army in the West.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By mid-May, Octavian began secret negotiations to form an alliance with Antony to provide a united Caesarian party against the Liberators. Remaining in Cisalpine Gaul, Octavian dispatched emissarie
2 CONC s to Rome in July 43 BC demanding he be appointed Consul to replace Hirtius and Pansa and that the decree declaring Antony a public enemy be rescinded. When the Senate refused, Octavian marched on Rom
2 CONC e with his eight legions and assumed control of the city in August 43 BC. Octavian proclaimed himself Consul, rewarded his soldiers, and then set about prosecuting Caesar's murderers. By the lex Pedia
2 CONC , all of the conspirators and Sextus Pompey were convicted in absentia and declared public enemies. Then, at the instigation of Lepidus, Octavian went to Cisalpine Gaul to meet Antony.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In November 43 BC, Octavian, Lepidus, and Antony met near Bononia.[86] After two days of discussions, the group agreed to establish a three man dictatorship to govern the Republic for five years, k
2 CONC nown as the "Three Man for the Restoration of the Republic" (Latin: "Triumviri Rei publicae Constituendae"), known to modern historians as the Second Triumvirate. In addition, they divided amongst the
2 CONC mselves military command of the Republic's armies and provinces: Antony received Gaul, Lepidus Spain, and Octavian (as the junior partner) Africa. The Government of Italy was undivided between the thr
2 CONC ee. The Triumvirate would have to conquer the rest of Rome's holdings, whilst the Eastern Mediterranean remained in the hands of Brutus and Cassius and control of the Mediterranean islands rested with
2 CONC  Sextus Pompey. On 27 November 43 BC, the Triumvirate was formally established by law, the lex Titia. To finalize their alliance, Octavian married Antony's step-daughter Clodia Pulchra.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The primary objective of the Triumvirate was to avenge Caesar's death and to make war upon his murderers. Before marching against Brutus and Cassius in the East, the Triumvirs decided to eliminate 
2 CONC their enemies in Rome. To do so, they employed a legalized form of mass murder: proscription. First used by the Dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 82 BC, Sulla drew up a list of his political enemies 
2 CONC to purge Rome of opposition to his rule. Any man whose name appeared on the list was stripped of his citizenship and excluded from all protection under the law. Furthermore, reward money was given to 
2 CONC anyone who gave information leading to the death of a proscribed man, and any person who killed a proscribed man was entitled to keep part of his property, with the remainder going to the state. No pe
2 CONC rson could inherit money or property from proscribed men, nor could any woman married to a proscribed man remarry after his death.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Like Sulla's proscription before it, the Triumvirate's proscription produced deadly results: one third of the Senate and two thousand Roman knights were killed. Among the most famous outlaws condem
2 CONC ned was Cicero, who was executed on December 7. In addition to the political consequences of eliminating opposition, the proscription also restored the State Treasury, which had been depleted by Caesa
2 CONC r's civil war the decade before. The fortune of a proscribed man would be confiscated by the state, giving the Triumvirate the funds they needed to pay for the coming war against Brutus and Cassius. W
2 CONC hen the proceeds from the sale of confiscated estates of the proscribed were insufficient to finance the war, the Triumvirs imposed new taxes, especially on the wealthy. By January 42 BC the proscript
2 CONC ion officially ended. Though only lasting two months and far less bloody than that of Sulla, the episode traumatized Roman society. To avoid being killed, a number of outlaws fled to either Sextus Pom
2 CONC pey in Sicily or to the Liberators in the East.[88] In order to legitimize their own rule, all Senators who survived the proscription were allowed to keep their positions if they swore allegiance to t
2 CONC he Triumvirate. In addition, to justify their war of vengeance against the murderers of Caesar, on 1 January 42 BC, the Triumvirate officially deified Caesar as "The Divine Julius".

2 CONT <p>''War against the Liberators''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Due to the infighting within the Triumvirate during 43 BC, Brutus and Cassius had assumed control of much of Rome's eastern territories, including amassing a large army. Before the Triumvirate coul
2 CONC d cross the Adriatic Sea into Greece where the Liberators had stationed their army, the Triumvirate had to address the threat posed by Sextus Pompey and his fleet. From his base in Sicily, Sextus raid
2 CONC ed the Italian coast and blockaded the Triumvirs. Octavian's friend and admiral Quintus Rufus Salvidienus thwarted an attack by Sextus against the southern Italian mainland at Rhegium, but Salvidienus
2 CONC  was then defeated in the resulting naval battle because of the inexperience of his crews. Only when Antony arrived with his fleet was the blockade broken. Though the blockade was defeated, control of
2 CONC  Sicily remained in Sextus's hand, but the defeat of the Liberators was the Triumvirate's first priority.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the summer of 42 BC, Octavian and Antony sailed for Macedonia to face the Liberators with nineteen legions, the vast majority of their army. (approximately 100,000 regular infantry plus supporti

2 CONC re not at full strength while the legions of Antony and Octavian were. While the Triumvirs commanded a larger number of infantry, the Liberators commanded a larger cavalry contingent. The Liberators, 
2 CONC who controlled Macedonia, did not wish to engage in a decisive battle, but rather to attain a good defensive position and then use their naval superiority to block the Triumvirs’ communications with
2 CONC  their supply base in Italy. They had spent the previous months plundering Greek cities to swell their war-chest and had gathered in Thrace with the Roman legions from the Eastern provinces and levies

2 CONT <p>Brutus and Cassius held a position on the high ground along both sides of the via Egnatia west of the city of Philippi. The south position was anchored to a supposedly impassable marsh, while the n

2 CONC ed the Triumvirate's army due to Octavian's sickness on the day, with Antony directly controlling the right flank opposite Cassius. Because of his health, Octavian remained in camp while his lieutenan

2 CONT <p>Brutus assumed sole command of the Liberator army and preferred a war of attrition over open conflict. His officers, however, were dissatisfied with these defensive tactics and his Caesarian vetera

2 CONT <p>The victory at Philippi left the members of the Triumvirate as masters of the Republic, save Sextus Pompey in Sicily. Upon returning to Rome, the Triumvirate repartioned rule of Rome's provinces be
2 CONC tween themselves, with Antony as the clear senior partner. He received the largest distribution, governing all of the Eastern provinces while retaining Gaul in the West. Octavian's position improved, 
2 CONC as he received Spain, which was taken from Lepidus. Lepdius was then reduced to holding only Africa, and he assumed a clearly tertiary role in the Triumvirate. Rule over Italy remained undivided, but 
2 CONC Octavian was assigned the difficult and unpopular task of demobilizing their veterans and providing them with land distributions in Italy. Antony assumed direct control of the East while he installed 
2 CONC one of his lieutenants as the ruler of Gaul. During his absence, several of his supporters held key positions at Rome to protect his interests there.

2 CONT <p>The East was in need of reorganization after the rule of the Liberators in the previous years. In addition, Rome contended with Parthian Empire for dominance of the Near East. The Parthian threat t
2 CONC o the Triumvirate's rule was urgent due to the fact that the Parthians supported the Liberators in the recent civil war, which aid included the supply troops at Philippi. As ruler of the East, Antony 
2 CONC also assumed responsibility for overseeing Caesar's planned invasion of Parthia to avenge the defeat of Marcus Licinius Crassus at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC.

2 CONT <p>In 42 BC, the Roman East was composed of a few directly controlled provinces. The provinces included Macedonia, Asia, Bithynia, Cilicia, Cyprus, Syria, and Cyrenaica. Approximately half of the East

2 CONT <p>Antony spent the winter of 42 BC in Athens, where he ruled generously towards the Greek cities. A proclaimed philhellene ("Friend of all things Greek"), Antony supported Greek culture to win the lo
2 CONC yalty of the inhabitants of the Greek East. He attended religious festivals and ceremonies, including initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries, a secret cult dedicated to the worship of the goddesses 
2 CONC Demeter and Persephone. Beginning in 41 BC, he traveled across the Aegean Sea to Anatolia, leaving his friend Lucius Marcius Censorius as governor of Macedonia and Achaea. Upon his arrival in Ephesus 
2 CONC in Asia, Antony was worshiped as the god Dionysus born a new. He demanded heavy taxes from the Hellenic cities in return for his pro-Greek culture policies, but exempted those cities which had remaine
2 CONC d loyal to Caesar during the his civil war and compensated those cities which had suffered under Caesar's assassins, including Rhodes, Lycian, and Tarsus. He granted pardons to all Roman nobles living
2 CONC  in the East who had supported the Republican cause, except for Caesar's assassins.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ruling from Ephesus, Antony consolidated Rome's hegemony in the East, receiving envoys from Rome's client kingdoms and intervening in their dynastic affairs, extracting enormous financial "gifts" f
2 CONC rom them in the process. Though King Deiotarus of Galatia supported Brutus and Cassius following Caesar's assassination, Antony allowed him to retain his position. He also confirmed Ariarathes X as ki
2 CONC ng of Cappadocia after the execution of his brother Ariobarzanes III of Cappadocia by Cassius before the battle of Philippi. In Hasmonean Judea, several Jewish delegations complained to Antony of the 
2 CONC harsh rule of Phasael and Herod, the sons of Rome's assassinated chief Jewish minister Antipater the Idumaean. After Herod offered him a large financial gift, Antony confirmed the brothers in their po
2 CONC sitions. Antony also began an affair with Glaphyra, the widow of Archelaus the Elder.[99] Archelaus had served as the high priest and ruler of the temple state of Comana in Cappadocia.[100] Through he
2 CONC r influence, Antony installed her son Archelaus the Younger as Rome's client king of Cappadocia in 36 BC after he executed Ariarathes X of Cappadocia for disloyalty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In October 41, Antony requested Rome's chief eastern vassal, the queen of Ptolemaic Egypt Cleopatra, meet him at Tarsus in Cilicia. Antony had first met a young Cleopatra while campaigning in Egypt
2 CONC  in 55 BC and again in 48 BC when Caesar had backed her as queen of Egypt over the claims of her half-sister Arsinoe. Cleopatra would bear Caesar a son, Caesarion, in 47 BC and the two living in Rome 
2 CONC as Caesar's guests until his assassination in 44 BC. After Caesar's assassination, Cleopatra and Caesarion returned to Egypt, where she named the child as her co-ruler. In 42 BC, the Triumvirate, in r
2 CONC ecognition for Cleopatra's help towards Publius Cornelius Dolabella in opposition to the Liberators, granted official recognition to Caesarion's position as king of Egypt. Arriving in Tarus aboard of 
2 CONC her magnificent ship, Cleopatra invited Antony to a grand banquet to solidify their alliance. [note 4] As the most powerful of Rome's eastern vassals, Egypt was indispensable in Rome's planned militar
2 CONC y invasion of the Parthian Empire. At Cleopatra's request, Antony ordered the execution of Arsinoe, who, though marched in Caesar's triumphal parade in 46 BC, had been granted sanctuary at the temple 
2 CONC of Artemis in Ephesus. Antony and Cleopatra then spent the winter of 41 BC together in Alexandria. Despite his marriage to Fulvia, Cleopatra bore Antony twin children, Alexander Helios and Cleopatra S
2 CONC elene II, in 40 BC. Antony also granted formal control over Cyprus, which had been under Egyptian control since 47 BC during the turmoil of Caesar's civil war, to Cleopatra in 40 BC as a gift for her 
2 CONC loyalty to Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony, in his first months in the East, raised money, reorganized his troops, and secured the alliance of Rome's client kingdoms. He also promoted himself as Hellenistic ruler, which won him the a
2 CONC ffection of the Greek peoples of the East but also made him the target of Octavian's propaganda in Rome. According to some ancient authors, Antony led a carefree life of luxury in Alexandria. Upon lea
2 CONC rning the Parthian Empire had invaded Rome's territory in early 40 BC, Antony left Egypt for Syria to confront the invasion. However, after a short stay in Tyre, he was forced to sail with his army to
2 CONC  Italy to confront Octavian due to Octavian's war against Antony's wife and brother.

2 CONT <p>''Fulvia's Civil War''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Following the defeat of Brutus and Cassius, while Antony was stationed in the East, Octavian was authority over the West. Octavian's chief responsibility was distributing land to tens of thousands 
2 CONC of Caesar's veterans who had fought for the Triumvirate. Additionally, tens of thousands of veterans who had fought for the Republican cause in the war also required land grants. This was necessary to
2 CONC  ensure they would not support a political opponent of the Triumvirate. However, the Triumvirs did not possess sufficient state-controlled land to allot to the veterans. This left Octavian with two ch
2 CONC oices: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who might back a military rebellion against the Triumvirate's rule. Octavian choose the former. As m
2 CONC any as eighteen Roman towns through Italy were affected by the confiscations of 41 BC, with entire populations driven out.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Led by Fulvia, the wife of Antony, the Senators grew hostile towards Octavian over the issue of the land confiscations. According to the ancient historian Cassius Dio, Fulvia was the most powerful 
2 CONC woman in Rome at the time. According to Dio, while Publius Servilius Vatia and Lucius Antonius were the Consuls for the year 41 BC, real power was vested in Fulvia. As the mother-in-law of Octavian an
2 CONC d the wife of Antony, no actions was taken by the Senate without her support. Fearing Octavian's land grants would cause the loyalty of the Caesarian veterans to shift away from Antony, Fulvia travele
2 CONC d constantly with her children to the new veteran settlements in order to remind the veterans of their debt to Antony. Fulvia also attempted to delay the land settlements until Antony returned to Rome
2 CONC , so that he could share credit for the settlements. With the help of Antony's brother, the Consul of 41 BC Lucius Antonius, Fulvia encouraged the Senate to oppose Octavian's land policies.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The conflict between Octavian and Fulvia caused great political and social unrest throughout Italy. Tensions escalated into open war, however, when Octavian divorced Clodia Pulchra, Fulvia's daught
2 CONC er from her first husband Publius Clodius Pulcher. Outraged, Fulvia, supported by Lucius, raised an army to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian. According to the ancient historian Appian, Fulvi
2 CONC a's chief reason for the war was her jealousy of Antony's affairs with Cleopatra in Egypt and desire to draw Antony back to Rome. Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octa
2 CONC vian and Lepidus, however, as the Roman army still depended on the Triumvirs for their salaries. Lucius and Fulvia, supported by their army, marched on Rome and promised the people an end to the Trium
2 CONC virate in favor of Antony's sole rule. However, when Octavian returned to the city with his army, the pair was forced to retreat to Perusia in Etruria. Octavian placed the city under siege while Luciu
2 CONC s waited for Antony's legions in Gaul to come to his aid. Away in the East and embarrassed by Fulvia's actions, Antony gave no instructions to his legions. Without reinforcements, Lucius and Fulvia we
2 CONC re forced to surrender in February 40 BC. While Octavian pardoned Lucius for his role in the war and even granted him command in Spain as his chief lieutenant there, Fulvia was forced to flee to Greec
2 CONC e with her children. With the war over, Octavian was left in sole control over Italy. When Antony's governor of Gaul died, Octavian took over his legions there, further strengthening his control over 
2 CONC the West.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Despite the Parthian Empire's invasion of Rome's eastern territories, Fulvia's civil war forced Antony to leave the East and return to Rome in order to secure his position. Meeting her in Athens, A
2 CONC ntony rebuked Fulvia for her actions before sailing on to Italy with his army to face Octavian, laying siege to Brundisium. This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however. Th
2 CONC eir centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their shared service under Caesar, with the legions under their command followed suit. Meanwhile, in Sicyon, Fulvi
2 CONC a died of a sudden and unknown illness. Fulvia's death and the mutiny of their soldiers allowed the triumvirs to effect a reconciliation through a new power sharing agreement in September 40 BC. The R
2 CONC oman world was redivided, with Antony receiving the Eastern provinces, Octavian receiving the Western provinces, and with Lepidus being relegated to a clearly junior position as governor of Africa. Th
2 CONC is agreement, known as the Treaty of Brundisium, reinforced the Triumvirate and allowed Antony begin preparing for Caesar's long-awaited campaign against the Parthian Empire. As a symbol of their rene
2 CONC wed alliance, Antony married Octavia, Octavian's sister, in October 40 BC.

2 CONT <p>''Antony's Parthian War'' ''Roman-Parthian Relations''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The rise of the Parthian Empire in the 3rd century BC and Rome's expansion into the Eastern Mediterranean during the 2nd century BC brought the two powers into direct contact, causing centuries of 
2 CONC tumultuous and strained relations. Though periods of peace developed cultural and commercial exchanges, war was a constant threat. Influence over the buffer state of the Kingdom of Armenia, located to
2 CONC  the east Roman Syria in and north-western Mesopotamia, was often a central issue in the Roman-Parthian conflict. In 95 BC, Parthian Shah Mithridates II, installed Tigranes the Great as Parthian's cli
2 CONC ent-king over Armenia. Tigranes would wage a series of three wars against Rome before being ultimately defeated by Pompey in 66 BC. Thereafter, with his son Artavasdes II in Rome as a hostage, Tigrane
2 CONC s would rule Armenia as an ally of Rome until his death in 55 BC. Rome then installed Artavasdes II as king and continued its influence over Armenia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 53 BC, Rome's governor of Syria, Marcus Licinius Crassus, led an expedition across the Euphrates River into Parthian territory to confront the Parthian Shah Orodes II. Artavasdes II offered Cras
2 CONC sus the aid of nearly forty thousand troops to assist his Parthian expedition on the condition that Crassus invade through Armenia as the safer route. Crassus refused, choosing instead the more direct
2 CONC  route by crossing the Euphrates directly into desert Parthian territory. Crassus' actions proved disastrous as his army was defeated at the Battle of Carrhae by a numerically inferior Parthian force.
2 CONC  Crassus' defeat forced Armenia to shift its loyalty to Parthia, with Artavasdes II's sister marrying Orodes' son and heir Pacorus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In early 44 BC, Julius Caesar announced his intentions to invade Parthia and restore Roman power in the East. His reasons were to punish the Parthians for assisting Pompey in the recent civil war, 
2 CONC to avenge Crassus' defeat at Carrhae, and especially to match the glory of Alexander the Great for himself. Before Caesar could launch his campaign, however, he was assassinated. As part of the compro
2 CONC mise between Antony and the Republicans to restore order following Caesar's murder, Publius Cornelius Dolabella was assigning the governorship of Syria and command over Caesar's planned Parthian campa
2 CONC ign. The compromise did not hold, however, and the Republicans were forced to flee to the East. The Republicans directed Quintus Labienus to attract the Parthians to their side in the resulting war ag
2 CONC ainst Antony and Octavian. After the Republicans were defeated at the Battle of Philippi, Labienus joined the Parthians. Despite Rome's internal turmoil during the time, the Parthians did not immediat
2 CONC ely benefit from the power vacuum in the East due to Orodes II's reluctance despite Labienus' urgings to the contrary.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the summer of 41 BC, Antony, to resassert Roman power in the East, conquered Palmyra on the Roman-Parthian border. Antony then spent the winter of 41 BC in Alexandria with Cleopatra, leaving onl
2 CONC y two legions to defend the Syrian border against Parthian incursions. The legions, however, were composed of former Republican troops and Labienus convinced Orodes II to invade.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Parthian Invasion''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A Parthian army, led by Orodes II's eldest son Pacorus, invaded Syria in early 40 BC. Labienus, the Republican ally of Brutus and Cassius, accompanied him to advise him and to rally the former Repu
2 CONC blican soldiers stationed in Syria to the Parthian cause. Labienus recruited many of the former Republican soldiers to the Parthian campaign in opposition to Antony. The joint Parthian-Roman force, af
2 CONC ter initial success in Syria, separated to lead their offensive in two directions: Pacorus marched south toward Hasmonean Judea while Labienus crossed the Taurus Mountains to the north into Cilicia. L
2 CONC abienus conquered southern Anatolia with little resistance. The Roman governor of Asia, Lucius Munatius Plancus, a partisan of Antony, was forced to flee his province, allowing Labienus to recruit the
2 CONC  Roman soldiers stationed there. For his part, Pacorus advanced south to Phoenicia and Palestine. In Hasmonean Judea, the exiled prince Antigonus allied himself with the Parthians. When his brother, R
2 CONC ome's client king Hyrcanus II, refused to accept Parthian domination, he was deposed in favor of Antigonus as Parthia's client king in Judea. Pacorus' conquest had capture much of the Syrian and Pales
2 CONC tinian interior, with much of the Phoenician coast occupied as well. The city of Tyre remained the last major Roman outpost in the region.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anthony, then in Egypt with Cleopatra, did not respond immediately to the Parthian invasion. Though he left Alexandria for Tyre in early 40 BC, when he learned of the civil war between his wife and
2 CONC  Octavian, he was forced to return to Italy with his army to secure his position in Rome rather than defeat the Pathians. Instead, Anthony dispatched Publius Ventidius Bassus to check the Parthian adv
2 CONC ance. Arriving in the East in spring 39 BC, Ventidius surprised Labienus near the Taurus Mountains, claiming victory at the Cilician Gates. Ventidius ordered Labienus executed as a traitor and the for
2 CONC merly rebellious Roman soldiers under his command were reincorporated under Antony's control. He then met a Parthian army at the border between Cilicia and Syria, defeating it and killing a large port
2 CONC ion of the Parthian soldiers at the Amanus Pass. Ventidius's actions temporarily halted the Parthian advanced and restored Roman authority in the East, forcing Pacorus to abandon his conquests and ret
2 CONC urn to Parthia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the spring of 38 BC, the Parthians resumed their offensive with Pacorus leading an army across the Euphrates. Ventidius, in order to gain time, leaked disinformation to Pacorus implying that he 
2 CONC should cross the Euphrates River at their usual ford. Pacorus did not trust this information and decided to cross the river much farther downstream; this was what Ventidius hoped would occur and gave 
2 CONC him time to get his forces ready. The Parthians faced no opposition and proceeded to the town of Gindarus in Cyrrhestica where Ventidius's army was waiting. At the Battle of Cyrrhestica, Ventidius inf
2 CONC licted an overwhelming defeat against the Parthians which resulted in the death of Pacorus. Overall, the Roman army had achieved a complete victory with Ventidius' three successive victories forcing t
2 CONC he Parthians back across the Euphrates. Pacorus' death threw the Parthian Empire into chaos. Shah Orodes II, overwhelmed by the grief of his son's death, appointed his younger son Phraates IV as his s
2 CONC uccessor. However, Phraates IV assassinated Orodes II in late 38 BC and succeeding him on the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ventidius feared Antony's wrath if he invaded Parthian territory, and thereby steal his glory, so he instead attacked and subdue the eastern kingdoms which had revolted against Rome following Rome'
2 CONC s defeat at Carrhae. One such rebel was King Antiochus of Commagene, whom he besieged in Samosata. Antiochus tried to make peace with Ventidius, but Ventidius told him to approach Antony directly. Aft
2 CONC er peace was concluded, Antony sent Ventidius back to Rome where he celebrated a triumph, the first Roman to triumph over the Parthians.

2 CONT <p>''Conflict with Sextus''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>While Antony and the other Triumvirs ratified the Treaty of Brundisium to redivide the Roman world among themselves, the rebel general Sextus Pompey, the son of Caesar's rival Pompey the Great, was
2 CONC  largely ignored. From his stronghold on Sicily, he continued his piracy activities across Italy and blocking the shipment of grain to Rome. The lack of food in Rome caused the public to blame the Tri
2 CONC umvirate and shift its sympathies towards Pompey. This pressure forced the Triumvirs to meet with Sextus in early 39 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>While Octavian wanted an end to the ongoing blockade of Italy, Anthony sought peace in the West in order to make the Triumvirate's legions available for his service in his planned campaign against 
2 CONC the Parthians. Though the Triumvirs rejected Sextus' initial request to replace Lepidus as the third man within the Triumvirate, they did grant other concessions. Under the terms of the Treaty of Mise
2 CONC num, Sextus was allowed to retain control over Sicily and Sardinia, with the provinces of Corsica and Greece being added to his territory. He was also promised a future position with the Priestly Coll
2 CONC ege of Augurs and the Consulship for 35 BC. In exchange, Sextus agreed to end his naval blockade of Italy, supply Rome with grain, and halt his piracy of Roman merchant ships.[136] However, the most i
2 CONC mportant provision of the Treaty was the end of the proscription the Trimumvirate had begun in late 43 BC. Many of the proscribed Senators, rather than face death, fled to Sicily seeking Sextus' prote
2 CONC ction. With the exception of those responsible for Caesar's assassination, all those proscribed were allowed to return to Rome and promised compensation. This caused Sextus to lose many valuable allie
2 CONC s as the formerly exiled Senators gradually aligned themselves with either Octavian or Antony. To secure the peace, Octavian betrothed his three-year-old nephew and Antony's stepson Marcus Claudius Ma
2 CONC rcellus to Sextus' daughter Pompeia. With peace in the West secured, Antony planned to retaliate against Parthia by invading their territory. Under an agreement with Octavian, Antony would be supplied
2 CONC  with extra troops for his campaign. With this military purpose on his mind, Antony sailed to Greece with Octavia, where he behaved in a most extravagant manner, assuming the attributes of the Greek g
2 CONC od Dionysus in 39 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The peace with Sextus was short lived, however. When Sextus demanded control over Greece as the agreement provided, Antony demanded the province's tax revenues be to fund the Parthian campaign. Sex
2 CONC tus refused. Meanwhile, Sextus' admiral Menas betrayed him, shifting his loyalty to Octavian and thereby granting him control of Corsica, Sardinia, three of Sextus' legions, and a larger naval force. 
2 CONC These actions worked to renew Sextus' blockade of Italy, preventing Octavian from sending the promised troops to Antony for the Parthian campaign. This new delay caused Antony to quarrel with Octavian
2 CONC , forcing Octavia to mediate a truce between them. Under the Treaty of Tarentum, Antony provided a large naval force for Octavian's use against Sextus while Octavian promised to raise new legions for 
2 CONC Antony to support his invasion of Parthia. As the term of the Triumvirate was set to expire at the end of 38 BC, the two unilaterally extended their term of office another five years until 33 BC witho
2 CONC ut seeking approval of the Senate or the popular assemblies. To seal the Treaty, Antony's elder son Marcus Antonius Antyllus, then only 6 years old, was betrothed to Octavian's only daughter Julia, th
2 CONC en only an infant. With the Treaty signed, Antony returned to the East, leaving Octavia in Italy.

2 CONT <p>''Reconquest of Judea''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>With Publius Ventidius Bassus returned to Rome in triumph for his defensive campaign against the Parthians, Antony appointed Gaius Sosius as the new governor of Syria and Cilicia in early 38 BC. An
2 CONC tony, still in the West negotiating with Octavian, ordered Sosius to depose Antigonus, who had been installed in the recent Parthian invasion as the ruler of Hasmonean Judea, and to make Herod the new
2 CONC  Roman client king in the region. Years before in 40 BC, the Roman Senate has proclaimed Herod "King of the Jews" because Herod had been a loyal supporter of Hyrcanus II, Rome's previous client king b
2 CONC efore the Parthian invasion, and was from a family with long standing connections to Rome. The Romans hoped to use Herod as a bulwark against the Parthians in the coming campaign.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Advancing south, Sosius captured the island-city of Aradus on the coast of Phoenicia by the end of 38 BC. The following year, the Romans besieged Jerusalem. After a forty-day siege, the Roman soldi
2 CONC ers stormed the city and, despite Herod's pleas for restraint, acted without mercy, pillaging and killing all in their path, prompting Herod to complain to Antony. Herod finally resorted to bribing So
2 CONC sius and his troops in order that they do not leave him "king of a desert". Antigonus was forced to surrender to Sosius, and was sent to Antony for the triumphal procession in Rome. Herod, however, fe
2 CONC aring that Antigonus would win backing in Rome, bribed Antony to execute Antigonus. Antony, who recognized that Antigonus would remain a permanent threat to Herod, ordered him beheaded in Antioch. Now
2 CONC  secure on his throne, Herod would rule the Herodian Kingdom until his death in 4 BC, and would be an ever-faithful client king of Rome.

2 CONT <p>''Parthian Campaign''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>With the Triumvirate renewed in 38 BC, Antony returned to Athens in the winter with his new wife Octavia, the sister of Octavian. With the assassination of the Parthian Shah Orodes II by his son Ph
2 CONC raates IV, who then seized the Parthian throne, in late 38 BC, Antony prepared to invade Parthia himself.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony, however, realized Octavian had no intention of sending him the additional legions he had promised under the Treaty of Tarentum. To supplement his own armies, Antony instead looked to Rome's
2 CONC  principal vassal in the East: his lover Cleopatra. In addition to significant financial resources, Cleopatra's backing of his Parthian campaign allowed Antony to amass the largest army Rome had ever 
2 CONC assembled in the East. Wintering in Antioch during 37, Antony's combined Roman-Egyptian army numbered some 200,000, including sixteen legions (approximately 160,000 soldiers) plus an additional 40,000
2 CONC  auxiliary units. Such a force was twice the size of Marcus Licinius Crassus's army from his failed Parthian invasion of 53 BC and three times those of Lucius Licinius Lucullus and Lucius Cornelius Su
2 CONC lla during the Mithridatic Wars. The size of his army indicated Antony's intention to conquer Parthia, or at least receive its submission by capturing the Parthian capital of Ecbatana. Antony's rear w

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony's first target for his invasion was the Kingdom of Armenia. Ruled by King Artavasdes II of Armenia, Armenia had been an ally of Rome since the defeat of Tigranes the Great by Pompey the Grea
2 CONC t in 66 BC during the Third Mithridatic War. However, following Marcus Licinius Crassus's defeat at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC, Armenia was forced into an alliance with Parthia due to Roman's weak
2 CONC ened position in the East. Antony dispatched Publius Canidius Crassus to Armenia, receiving Artavasdes II's surrender without opposition. Canidius then led an invasion into the Transcaucasia, subduing
2 CONC  Iberia. There, Canidius forced the Iberian King Pharnavaz II into an alliance against Zober, king of neighboring Albania, subduing the kingdom and reducing it to a Roman protectorate.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>With Armenia and the Caucasus secured, Antony marched south, crossing into the Parthian province of Media Atropatene. Though Antony desired a pitched battle, the Parthians would not engage, allowin
2 CONC g Antony to march deep into Parthian territory by mid-August of 36 BC. This forced Antony to leave his logistics train in the care of two legions (approximately 10,000 soldiers), which was then attack
2 CONC ed and completely destroyed by the Parthian army before Antony could rescue them. Though the Armenian King Artavasdes II and his cavalry were present during the massacre, they did not intervene. Despi
2 CONC te the ambush, Antony continued the campaign. However, Antony was soon forced to retreat in mid-October after a failed two-month siege of the provincial capital.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The retreat soon proved a disaster as Antony's demoralized army faced increasing supply difficulties in the mountainous terrain during winter while constantly being harassed by the Parthian army. A

2 CONT <p>Again with Egyptian money, Antony invaded Armenia, this time successfully. In the return, a mock Roman Triumph was celebrated in the streets of Alexandria. The parade through the city was a pastich

2 CONT <p>While the distribution of nations among Cleopatra's children was hardly a conciliatory gesture, it did not pose an immediate threat to Octavian's political position. Far more dangerous was the ackn
2 CONC owledgment of Caesarion as legitimate and heir to Caesar's name. Octavian's base of power was his link with Caesar through adoption, which granted him much-needed popularity and loyalty of the legions
2 CONC . To see this convenient situation attacked by a child borne by the richest woman in the world was something Octavian could not accept. The triumvirate expired on the last day of 33 BC and was not ren
2 CONC ewed. Another civil war was beginning.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During 33 and 32 BC, a propaganda war was fought in the political arena of Rome, with accusations flying between sides. Antony (in Egypt) divorced Octavia and accused Octavian of being a social ups
2 CONC tart, of usurping power, and of forging the adoption papers by Caesar. Octavian responded with treason charges: of illegally keeping provinces that should be given to other men by lots, as was Rome's 
2 CONC tradition, and of starting wars against foreign nations (Armenia and Parthia) without the consent of the Senate.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony was also held responsible for Sextus Pompeius' execution with no trial. In 32 BC, the Senate deprived him of his powers and declared war against Cleopatra – not Antony, because Octavian ha
2 CONC d no wish to advertise his role in perpetuating Rome's internecine bloodshed. Both consuls, Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Gaius Sosius, and a third of the Senate abandoned Rome to meet Antony and Cl
2 CONC eopatra in Greece.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 31 BC, the war started. Octavian's loyal and talented general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa captured the Greek city and naval port of Methone, loyal to Antony. The enormous popularity of Octavian wit
2 CONC h the legions secured the defection of the provinces of Cyrenaica and Greece to his side. On September 2, the naval battle of Actium took place. Antony and Cleopatra's navy was destroyed, and they wer
2 CONC e forced to escape to Egypt with 60 ships.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Death''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Octavian, now close to absolute power, did not intend to give Antony and Cleopatra any rest. In August 30 BC, assisted by Agrippa, he invaded Egypt. With no other refuge to escape to, Antony commit
2 CONC ted suicide by stabbing himself with his sword in the mistaken belief that Cleopatra had already done so. When he found out that Cleopatra was still alive, his friends brought him to Cleopatra's monum
2 CONC ent in which she was hiding, and he died in her arms.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cleopatra was allowed to conduct Antony's burial rites after she had been captured by Octavian. Realising that she was destined for Octavian's triumph in Rome, she made several attempts to take her
2 CONC  life and finally succeeded in mid-August. Octavian had Caesarion murdered, but he spared Antony's children by Cleopatra, who were paraded through the streets of Rome. Antony's daughters by Octavia we
2 CONC re spared, as was his son, Iullus Antonius. But his elder son, Marcus Antonius Antyllus, was killed by Octavian's men while pleading for his life in the Caesareum.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Aftermath and legacy'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Cicero's son, Cicero Minor, announced Antony's death to the senate. Antony's honours were revoked and his statues removed (damnatio memoriae). Cicero Minor also made a decree that no member of the 
2 CONC Antonii would ever bear the name Marcus again. “In this way Heaven entrusted the family of Cicero the final acts in the punishment of Antony.”
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Antony died, Octavian became uncontested ruler of Rome. In the following years, Octavian, who was known as Augustus after 27 BC, managed to accumulate in his person all administrative, politic
2 CONC al, and military offices. When Augustus died in AD 14, his political powers passed to his adopted son Tiberius; the Roman Principate had begun.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The rise of Caesar and the subsequent civil war between his two most powerful adherents effectively ended the credibility of the Roman oligarchy as a governing power and ensured that all future pow
2 CONC er struggles would centre upon which one individual would achieve supreme control of the government, eliminating the Senate and the former magisterial structure as important foci of power in these con
2 CONC flicts. Thus, in history, Antony appears as one of Caesar's main adherents, he and Octavian Augustus being the two men around whom power coalesced following the assassination of Caesar, and finally as
2 CONC  one of the three men chiefly responsible for the demise of the Roman Republic.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Marriages and issue'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony had been married in succession to Fadia, Antonia, Fulvia, Octavia and Cleopatra, and left behind him a number of children. Through his daughters by Octavia, he would be ancestor to the Roman
2 CONC  Emperors Caligula, Claudius and Nero.

2 CONT <p>Early life</p>
2 CONT <p>Antony was born in Rome around 83 BC. His father was his namesake, Marcus Antonius Creticus, the son of the great rhetorician Marcus Antonius Orator executed by Gaius Marius' supporters in 86 BC. T
2 CONC hrough his mother Julia Caesaris, he was a distant cousin of Julius Caesar. His father died at a young age, leaving him and his brothers, Lucius and Gaius, to the care of his mother. Julia Antonia (kn
2 CONC own in sources by her married name, to distinguish her from the other Julias) then married Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura, a politician involved in and executed during the Catiline conspiracy of 63 B
2 CONC C.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony's early life was characterized by a lack of parental guidance. According to historians like Plutarch, he spent his teenage years roaming through Rome with his brothers and friends (Publius C
2 CONC lodius Pulcher among them - probably out of hostility to Cicero, who had caused Lentulus Sura to be put to death as a Catilinarian; the connection was severed by a disagreement arising from his relati
2 CONC ons with Clodius's wife, Fulvia). Together, they embarked on a rather wild sort of life, frequenting gambling houses, drinking too much, and involving themselves in scandalous love affairs. Plutarch m
2 CONC entions the rumour that before Antony reached twenty years of age, he was already indebted the sum of 250 talents (equivalent to several million dollars).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After this period of recklessness, Antony fled to Greece to escape his creditors and to study rhetoric. After a short time spent in attendance on the philosophers at Athens, he was summoned by Aulu
2 CONC s Gabinius, proconsul of Syria, to take part in the campaigns against Aristobulus in Judea, and in support of Ptolemy Auletes in Egypt. In the ensuing campaign, he demonstrated his talents as a cavalr
2 CONC y commander and distinguished himself with bravery and courage. It was during this campaign that he first visited Egypt and Alexandria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Supporter of Caesar</p>
2 CONT <p>In 54 BC, Antony became a member of the staff of Caesar's armies in Gaul. He again proved to be a competent military leader in the Gallic wars, but his personality caused instability wherever he we
2 CONC nt. Caesar himself was said to be frequently irritated by his behaviour.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nevertheless, raised by Caesar's influence to the offices of quaestor, augur, and tribune of the plebs (50 BC), he supported the cause of his patron with great energy. Caesar's two proconsular comm
2 CONC ands, during a period of ten years, were expiring, and the general wanted to return to Rome for the consular elections. But resistance from the conservative faction of the Roman Senate, led by Pompey,
2 CONC  demanded that Caesar resign his proconsulship and the command of his armies before being allowed to seek re-election to the consulship. This he could not do, as such an act would leave him a private 
2 CONC citizen--and therefore open to prosecution for his acts while proconsul--in the interim between his proconsulship and his second consulship; it would also leave him at the mercy of Pompey's armies. An
2 CONC tony proposed that both generals lay down their commands. The idea was rejected, and Antony resorted to violence, ending up expelled from the Senate. He left Rome, joining Caesar, who had led his armi
2 CONC es to the banks of the Rubicon, the river that marked the southern limit of his proconsular authority. With all hopes of a peaceful solution for the conflict with Pompey gone, Caesar led his armies ac
2 CONC ross the river into Italy and marched on Rome, starting the last Republican civil war. During the civil war, Antony was Caesar's second in command. In all battles against the Pompeians, Antony led the
2 CONC  left wing of the army, a proof of Caesar's confidence in him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Caesar became dictator, Antony was made master of the horse, the dictator's right hand man, and in this capacity remained in Italy as the peninsula's administrator in 47 BC, while Caesar was f
2 CONC ighting the last Pompeians, who had taken refuge in the African provinces. But Antony's skills as administrator were a poor match to those as general, and he seized the opportunity of indulging in the
2 CONC  most extravagant excesses, depicted by Cicero in the Philippics. In 46 BC he seems to have taken offence because Caesar insisted on payment for the property of Pompey which Antony professedly had pur
2 CONC chased, but had in fact simply appropriated. Conflict soon arose, and, as on other occasions, Antony resorted to violence. Hundreds of citizens were killed and Rome herself descended into a state of a
2 CONC narchy. Caesar was most displeased with the whole affair and removed Antony from all political responsibilities. The two men did not see each other for two years. The estrangement was not of long cont
2 CONC inuance; for we find Antony meeting the dictator at Narbo (45 BC), and rejecting the suggestion of Trebonius that he should join in the conspiracy that was already on foot. Reconciliation arrived in 4
2 CONC 4 BC, when Antony was chosen as partner for Caesar's fifth consulship.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Whatever conflicts existed between the two men, Antony remained faithful to Caesar at all times. In February of 44 BC, during the Lupercalia festival (February 15), Antony publicly offered Caesar a
2 CONC  diadem. This was an event fraught with meaning: a diadem was a symbol of a king, and in refusing it, Caesar demonstrated that he did not intend to assume the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On March 15, 44 BC (the Ides of March), Julius Caesar was assassinated by a group of Senators, led by Gaius Cassius Longinus and Marcus Junius Brutus. In the turmoil that surrounded the event, Anto
2 CONC ny escaped Rome dressed as a slave, fearing that the dictator's assassination would be the start of a bloodbath among his supporters. When this did not occur, he soon returned to Rome, discussing a tr
2 CONC uce with the assassins' faction. For a while, Antony, as consul of the year, seemed to pursue peace and the end of the political tension. Following a speech by Marcus Tullius Cicero in the Senate, an 
2 CONC amnesty was agreed for the assassins. Then came the day of Caesar's funeral. As Caesar's ever-present second in command, partner in consulship and cousin, Antony was the natural choice to make the fun
2 CONC eral eulogy. In his speech, he sprang his accusations of murder and ensured a permanent breach with the conspirators. Showing a talent for rhetoric and dramatic interpretation, Antony snatched the tog
2 CONC a from Caesar's body to show the crowd the scars from his wounds. That night, the Roman populace attacked the assassins' houses, forcing them to flee for their lives.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony surrounded himself with a bodyguard of Caesar's veterans, and forced the senate to transfer to him the province of Cisalpine Gaul, which was then administered by Decimus Junius Brutus, one o
2 CONC f the conspirators. Brutus refused to surrender the province, and Antony set out to attack him in October 44 BC.

2 CONC other civil war was starting. It was then that Octavian, Caesar's great-nephew and adopted son, arrived from Illyria, and claimed the inheritance of his "father." Octavian obtained the support of the 
2 CONC senate and of Cicero; and the veteran troops of the dictator flocked to his standard. He was also very willing to fight for power with the other two main contestants: Antony himself and Lepidus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony was denounced as a public enemy, and Octavian was entrusted with the command of the war against him. Antony was defeated at Mutina (43 BC) where he was besieging Brutus. The consuls Aulus Hi
2 CONC rtius and C. Vibius Pansa, however, fell in the battle, and the senate became suspicious of Octavian, who, irritated at the refusal of a triumph and the appointment of Brutus to the command over his h
2 CONC ead, entered Rome at the head of his troops, and forced the senate to bestow the consulship upon him (August 19). Meanwhile, Antony escaped to Cisalpine Gaul, effected a junction with Lepidus and marc
2 CONC hed towards Rome with a large force of infantry and cavalry. Octavian betrayed his party, and came to terms with Antony and Lepidus. The three leaders met at Bononia and adopted the title of Triumviri
2 CONC  reipublicae constituendae as joint rulers. Gaul was to belong to Antony, Hispania to Lepidus, and Africa, Sardinia and Sicily to Octavian.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Triumvirs for the Organization of the People gained official recognition by the Lex Titia, a law passed by the Assembly in 43 BC, which granted them virtually all powers for a period of five ye
2 CONC ars. To solidify the alliance, Octavian married Clodia, Antony's step-daughter. The triumvirs then set to pursue the assassins' faction, who had fled to the East, and to murder the conspirators' suppo
2 CONC rters who remained in Rome. A reign of terror followed; proscriptions, confiscations, and executions became general; some of the noblest citizens were put to death. Cicero was the most famous victim o
2 CONC f these violent days, having been executed during his attempt to flee, according to Anthony Everitt's recent biography. Antony and his wife Fulvia did not spare the body: Cicero's head and hands were 
2 CONC posted in the Rostra, with his tongue pierced by Fulvia's golden hairpins. After the twin battles at Philippi and the suicides of Brutus and Cassius, the senatorial and republican parties had been ann
2 CONC ihilated; no one else would defy the triumvirate's power.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>With the political and military situations resolved, the triumvirs divided the Roman world among themselves. Lepidus took control of the Western provinces, and Octavian remained in Italy with the r
2 CONC esponsibility of securing lands for the veteran soldiers—an important task, since the loyalty of the legions depended heavily on this promise. As for Antony, he went to the Eastern provinces, to pac
2 CONC ify yet another rebellion in Judaea and attempt to conquer the Parthian Empire. During this trip, he met Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt in Tarsus, in 41 BC, and became her lover, spending the winter in 
2 CONC her company at Alexandria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Meanwhile, in Italy, the situation was not pacified. Octavian's administration was not appeasing, and a revolt was about to occur. Moreover, he divorced Clodia, giving a curious explanation: she wa
2 CONC s annoying. The leader of this revolt was Fulvia, the wife of Antony, a woman known to history for her political ambition and tempestuous character. She feared for her husband's political position and
2 CONC  was not keen to see her daughter put aside. Assisted by Lucius Antonius, her brother-in-law, Fulvia raised eight legions with her own money. Her army invaded Rome, and for a while managed to create p
2 CONC roblems for Octavian. However, in the winter of 41–40 BC, Fulvia was besieged in Perusia and forced to surrender by starvation. Fulvia was exiled to Sicyon, where she died while waiting for Antony's
2 CONC  arrival.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Fulvia's death was providential. A reconciliation was effected between the triumvirs, and cemented by the marriage of Antony with Octavia in October 40 BC, Octavian's beloved sister. A new division
2 CONC  of the Roman world was made, Lepidus receiving Africa, Octavian the west, and Antony the east. This peace, known as the Treaty of Brundisium, reinforced the triumvirate and allowed Antony to finally 
2 CONC prepare his long-awaited campaign against the Parthians.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Antony and Cleopatra</p>
2 CONT <p>With this military purpose on his mind, Antony sailed to Greece with his new wife, where he behaved in a most extravagant manner, assuming the attributes of the god Dionysus (39 BC). But the rebell
2 CONC ion in Sicily of Sextus Pompeius, the last of the Pompeians, kept the army promised to Antony in Italy. With his plans again severed, Antony and Octavian quarreled again. This time with the help of Oc
2 CONC tavia, a new treaty was signed in Tarentum in 38 BC. The triumvirate was renewed for a period of another five years (ending in 33 BC) and Octavian promised again to send legions to the East.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>But by now, Antony was skeptical of Octavian's true support of his Parthian cause. Leaving Octavia pregnant of her second Antonia in Rome, he sailed to Alexandria, where he expected funding from Cl
2 CONC eopatra, the mother of his twins. The queen of Egypt loaned him the money he needed for the army, but the campaign proved a disaster. After a series of defeats in battle, Antony lost most of his Egypt
2 CONC ian army during a retreat through Armenia in the peak of winter.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Meanwhile in Rome, the triumvirate was no more. Lepidus was forced to resign after an ill-judged political move. Now in sole power, Octavian was occupied in wooing the traditional Republican aristo
2 CONC cracy to his side. He married Livia and started to attack Antony in order to raise himself to power. He argued that Antony was a man of low morals to have left his faithful wife abandoned in Rome with
2 CONC  the children to be with the promiscuous queen of Egypt. Antony was accused of everything, but most of all, of "becoming native", an unforgivable crime to the proud Romans. Several times Antony was su
2 CONC mmoned to Rome, but remained in Alexandria with Cleopatra.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Again with Egyptian money, Antony invaded Armenia, this time successfully. In the return, a mock Roman triumph was celebrated in the streets of Alexandria. The parade through the city was a pastich
2 CONC e of Rome's most important military celebration. For the finale, the whole city was summoned to hear a very important political statement. Surrounded by Cleopatra and her children, Antony was about to
2 CONC  put an end to his alliance with Octavian. He distributed kingdoms between his children: Alexander Helios was named king of Armenia and Parthia (not conquered yet), his twin Cleopatra Selene got Cyren
2 CONC aica and Libya, and the young Ptolemy Philadelphus was awarded Syria and Cilicia. As for Cleopatra, she was proclaimed Queen of Kings and Queen of Egypt, to rule with Caesarion (Ptolemy Caesar, son of
2 CONC  Julius Caesar), King of Kings and King of Egypt. Most important of all, Caesarion was declared legitimate son and heir of Julius Caesar. These proclamations were known as the Donations of Alexandria 
2 CONC and caused a fatal breach in Antony's relations with Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Distributing insignificant lands among the children of Cleopatra was not a peace move, but it was not a serious problem either. What did seriously threaten Octavian's political position, however, w
2 CONC as the acknowledgement of Caesarion as legitimate and heir to Julius Caesar's name. Octavian's base of power was his link with Caesar through adoption, which granted him much-needed popularity and loy
2 CONC alty of the legions. To see this convenient situation attacked by a child sired by the richest woman in the world was something Octavian could not accept. The triumvirate expired on the last day of 33
2 CONC  BC and was not renewed. Another civil war was beginning.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During 33 and 32 BC, a propaganda war was fought in the political arena of Rome, with accusations flying between sides. Antony (in Egypt) divorced Octavia and accused Octavian of being a social ups
2 CONC tart, of usurping power, and of forging the adoption papers by Julius Caesar. Octavian responded with treason charges: of illegally keeping provinces that should be given to other men by lots, as was 
2 CONC Rome's tradition, and of starting wars against foreign nations (Armenia and Parthia) without the consent of the Senate. Antony was also held responsible for Sextus Pompeius' execution with no trial. I
2 CONC n 32 BC, the senate deprived him of his powers and declared war against Cleopatra. Both consuls (Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Gaius Sosius) and a third of the Senate abandoned Rome to meet Antony a
2 CONC nd Cleopatra in Greece.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 31 BC, the war started. Octavian's loyal and talented general Agrippa captured the Greek city and naval port of Methone, loyal to Antony. The enormous popularity of Octavian with the legions sec
2 CONC ured the defection of the provinces of Cyrenaica and Greece to his side. On September 2, the naval Battle of Actium took place. Antony and Cleopatra's navy was destroyed, and they were forced to escap
2 CONC e to Egypt with sixty ships.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Octavian, now close to absolute power, did not intend to give them rest. In August 30 BC, assisted by Agrippa, he invaded Egypt. With no other refuge to escape to, Antony committed suicide in the m
2 CONC istaken belief that Cleopatra had already done so (30 BC). A few days later, Cleopatra herself followed his example.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antony had been married in succession to Fadia, Antonia, Fulvia and Octavia, and left behind him a number of children.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>[edit]</p>
2 CONT <p>Aftermath and Legacy</p>
2 CONT <p>With the death of Antony, Octavian became uncontested ruler of Rome: no one else attempted to take power from him. In the following years, Octavian, known as Augustus Caesar after 27 BC, managed to
2 CONC  accumulate in his person all administrative, political, and military offices. When Augustus died in AD 14, his political powers passed to his adopted son Tiberius; the Roman Principate had begun.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The rise of Caesar and the subsequent civil war between his two most powerful adherents effectively ended the credibility of the Roman oligarchy as a governing power and ensured that all future pow
2 CONC er struggles would centre upon which of two (or more) individuals would achieve supreme control of the government, rather than upon an individual in conflict with the Senate. Thus Antony, as Caesar's 
2 CONC key adherent and one of the two men around whom power coalesced following his assassination, was one of the three men chiefly responsible for the fall of the Roman Republic.

2 CONT <p>=Laodice VI=</p>
2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice VI (flourished 2nd century BC, died 115–113 BC) was a Greek Seleucid Princess and through marriage was a Queen of the Kingdom of Pontus.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice was the daughter born from the full blooded sibling union of the Seleucid Monarchs Antiochus IV Epiphanes and Laodice IV. Her grandparents were the Seleucid Monarchs Antiochus III the Great
2 CONC  and Laodice III. Through her mother’s previous marriages, she had various maternal half-brothers and sisters and two full blooded brothers who served as Seleucid Kings Antiochus V Eupator and Alexa
2 CONC nder Balas. In 152 BC, Laodice became one of the supporters for her brother Alexander Balas, who revolted and overthrew the Seleucid King Demetrius I Soter, who was their maternal half-brother/cousin.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After 152 BC, Laodice married King Mithridates V of Pontus,[2] who reigned from 150–120 BC. Mithridates V and Laodice VI were related, as her husband had lineage from the Seleucid dynasty. Little
2 CONC  is known regarding her relationship with her husband or her reign as Pontian Queen. During their marriage, Laodice bore Mithridates V seven children: Laodice of Cappadocia, Mithridates VI of Pontus, 
2 CONC Mithridates Chrestus, Laodice, Nysa (sometimes spelt as Nyssa), Roxana and Statira. Nysa, Roxana and Statira were put to death after the fall of the Kingdom of Pontus in 63 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates V was assassinated in about 120 BC in Sinope poisoned by unknown persons at a lavish banquet which he held. In the will of Mithridates V, he left the Kingdom to the joint rule of Laodic
2 CONC e, Mithridates VI and Mithridates Chrestus. Both of her sons were underage to rule and Laodice retained all power as regent.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice in her regency favored her second son over her first son. During her regency 120–116 BC (even perhaps up to 113 BC), Mithridates VI escaped from the plotting of his mother and had gone in
2 CONC to hiding. She enjoyed luxuries that made her a compliant client of Rome. She accepted bribes from the Roman Republic and her extravagance pushed Pontus into debt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates VI between 116–113 BC returned to Pontus from hiding and was hailed King. He was able to remove his mother and his brother from the Pontian throne, thus Mithridates VI became the sole
2 CONC  ruler of Pontus. Mithridates VI show clemency towards his mother and brother, by imprisoning them both. Laodice VI died in prison of natural causes, however his brother Mithridates Chrestus could hav
2 CONC e died in prison from natural causes or was tried for treason and was executed on the orders of his brother. When they died, Mithridates VI gave his mother and brother, a royal funeral.

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p>=Gaius Antonius Hybrida=</p>
2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Gaius Antonius Hybrida (flourished 1st century BC) was a politician of the Roman Republic. He was the second son of Marcus Antonius Orator and brother of Marcus Antonius Creticus; his mother is unk
2 CONC nown. He was the uncle of the famed triumvir Mark Antony.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Life'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His military career started as a legate and cavalry commander of Lucius Cornelius Sulla during the Mithridatic Wars. After Sulla's return to Rome, Hybrida remained in Greece with a force of cavalry
2 CONC . He was supposed to maintain peace and order but ended in plundering the countryside and sacking for his own profit several temples and holy places. It was the rumors of his plundering and atrocities
2 CONC  committed on the local population, which included maiming and torture, that earned him the nickname Hybrida ("half-beast") (Pliny, Nat. Hist. viii. 213).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 76 BC, he was prosecuted for his malpractices by the young Julius Caesar, but escaped punishment because he successfully appealed to the people's tribunes. Years later, in 70 BC, he was removed 
2 CONC from the Senate and stripped of senatorial rank by the censors, still on charges due to the atrocities committed in Greece. In spite of his bad reputation, however, he was elected tribune in 71 BC, wh
2 CONC ich meant that he again joined the Senate; then praetor in 66 BC, and finally consul with Marcus Tullius Cicero in 63 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''For, when Marcus Cicero had become consul with Gaius Antonius, and Mithridates no longer caused any injury to the Romans, but had destroyed himself...''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He secretly supported Lucius Sergius Catilina, but Cicero won him to his side by promising him the governorship of the rich province of Macedonia.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''This alarm Cicero first sought to allay by getting the province of Macedonia voted to his colleague, while he himself declined the proffered province of Gaul; and by this favour he induced Antoni
2 CONC us, like a hired actor, to play the second role to him in defence of their country.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the outbreak of the Catilinarian conspiracy, Hybrida was obliged as consul to lead an army into Etruria, but handed over the command on the day of battle to Marcus Petreius, on the ground of ill
2 CONC  health.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He then went to Macedonia, where he made himself so detested by his oppressive rule and extortions over the people, that he was forced to leave the province. In 59 BC, Hybrida was accused in Rome, 
2 CONC by Marcus Caelius Rufus, both of having taken part in the Catilinarian conspiracy and of extortion in his province. It was said that Cicero had agreed with Gaius to share his plunder. Cicero's defence
2 CONC  of Hybrida two years before in view of a proposal for his recall, and also on the occasion of his trial, increased the suspicion. Despite Cicero's defence, Hybrida was condemned and went into exile a
2 CONC t Kefalonia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''The latter, while governor of Macedonia, had inflicted many injuries upon the subject territory as well as upon that which was in alliance with Rome, and had suffered many disasters in return. Fo
2 CONC r after ravaging the possessions of the Dardanians and their neighbours, he did not dare to await their attack, but pretending to retire with his cavalry for some other purpose, took to flight; in thi
2 CONC s way the enemy surrounded his infantry and forcibly drove them out of the country, even taking away their plunder from them. When he tried the same tactics on the allies in Moesia, he was defeated ne
2 CONC ar the city of the Istrians by the Bastarnian Scythians who came to their aid; and thereupon he ran away. It was not for this conduct, however, that he was accused, but he was indicted for complicity 
2 CONC in Catiline's conspiracy; yet he was convicted on the former charge, so that it was his fate to be found not guilty of the crime for which he was being tried, but to be punished for something of which
2 CONC  he was not accused. That was the way he came off. But Cicero, who defended him at this time because Antonius had been his colleague, made a most bitter attack upon Caesar, whom he held responsible fo
2 CONC r the suit against him, and even went so far as to heap abuse upon him.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He seems to have been recalled by Caesar, since he was present at a meeting of the Roman Senate in 44 BC and was censor in 42 BC.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hybrida married an unnamed Roman woman. By his wife, he had two daughters:</p>
2 CONT <p>* Antonia Hybrida Major (Major Latin for the elder) married Roman tribune Lucius Caninius Gallus.</p>
2 CONT <p>* Antonia Hybrida Minor (Minor Latin for the younger) married her first paternal cousin Mark Antony as his second wife.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From his daughter’s marriages, he had at least two grandchildren who were a younger Lucius Caninius Gallus and Antonia.</p>

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Julia Caesaris (104 BC-after 39 BC) or Julia Antonia (known from the sources to distinguish her from the other Juliae Caesares) was a daughter of Lucius Julius Caesar, the consul of 90 BC, and moth
2 CONC er of the future triumvir and deputy of Caesar, Mark Antony. She was a sister of the Lucius Julius Caesar who was consul in 64 BC. Her mother is unknown. She was born and raised in Rome. Julia was a c
2 CONC ousin of Julius Caesar.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Julia married Marcus Antonius Creticus, a man of a senatorial family. Their sons were the triumvir Mark Antony, Gaius Antonius and Lucius Antonius. Because of their kinship through her, Gaius Juliu
2 CONC s Caesar was obliged to promote the political careers of her sons,[citation needed] despite his distaste for their father and his generally low opinion of their abilities. After Julia’s first husban
2 CONC d died in 74 BC, she married Publius Cornelius Lentulus (Sura), a politician who in 63 BC was involved in the Catilinarian conspiracy and was executed on the orders of Cicero.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Julia had raised her sons through her marriages. Plutarch describes her as one of “most nobly born and admirable women of her time”, though most other sources are considerably less flattering (
2 CONC and likely more accurate). The following clause from Plutarch describes her relationship with her first husband:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''His father was Antony, surnamed of Crete, not very famous or distinguished in public life, but a worthy good man, and particularly remarkable for his liberality, as may appear from a single examp
2 CONC le. He was not very rich, and was for that reason checked in the exercise of his good nature by his wife. A friend that stood in need of money came to borrow of him. Money he had none, but he bade a s
2 CONC ervant bring him water in a silver basin, with which, when it was brought, he wetted his face, as if he meant to shave, and, sending away the servant upon another errand, gave his friend the basin, de
2 CONC siring him to turn it to his purpose. And when there was afterwards a great inquiry for it in the house, and his wife was in a very ill humour, and was going to put the servants one by one to the sear
2 CONC ch, he acknowledged what he had done, and begged her pardon.
2 CONT <p>— Plutarch, Antony 1''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Elsewhere Plutarch illustrates her character with an episode from the proscription of 43 BC, during the Second Triumvirate:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''His uncle, Lucius Caesar, being closely pursued, took refuge with his sister, who, when the murderers had broken into her house and were pressing into her chamber, met them at the door, and sprea
2 CONC ding out hands, cried out several times. "You shall not kill Lucius Caesar till you first dispatch me who gave your general his birth!" and in this manner she succeeded in getting her brother out of t
2 CONC he way, and saving his life. — Plutarch, Antony 20''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the Perusine War (modern Perugia) between 41-40 BC, Julia left Rome, although Octavian (future Roman Emperor Augustus) treated her with kindness. She never trusted Sextus Pompeius. When Sext
2 CONC us Pompeius was in Sicily, Julia had sent to Greece for Antony, a distinguished escort and convoy of triremes. After the reconciliation of the triumvirs, Julia returned with Antony to Italy in 39 BC a
2 CONC nd was probably present at the meeting with Sextus Pompeius at Misenum.

2 CONT <p>Nysa or Nyssa (Greek: Νύσ(σ)α, flourished 2nd century BC) was a Greek Seleucid Princess and a Queen of the Kingdom of Pontus.</p>

2 CONT <p>Nysa was born and raised in the Seleucid Empire and she was born between 196 BC-193 BC. In 193 BC, her father had died. Her family were in complete grief of his death, in particular Antiochus III.[

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Through marriage Nysa became a Queen of Pontus. The marriage that occurred between Pharnaces and Nysa was a continuation and the strengthening of the pro-Seleucid orientation in foreign policy of P

2 CONC Pharnaces were related as he was a first cousin to Nysa’s parents, thus Pharnaces was related to the Seleucid dynasty. Little is known on Nysa’s relationship with Pharnaces and how she reigned as

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} '''Antiochus IV Epiphanes''' (play /ænˈtaɪ.əkəs ɛˈpɪfəniːz/; Greek: Ἀντίοχος Ἐπιφανής, 'God Manifest'; c. 215 BC – 164 BC) ruled the Seleucid Empire from 
2 CONC 175 BC until his death in 164 BC. He was a son of King Antiochus III the Great. His original name was Mithridates; he assumed the name Antiochus after he ascended the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Notable events during the reign of Antiochus IV include his near-conquest of Egypt, which led to a confrontation that became an origin of the metaphorical phrase, "line in the sand" (see below), an
2 CONC d the rebellion of the Jewish Maccabees.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus was the first Seleucid king to use divine epithets on coins, perhaps inspired by Bactrian Hellenistic kings who had earlier done so, or else building on the ruler cult that his father Ant
2 CONC iochus the Great had codified within the Seleucid Empire. These epithets included Θεὸς Ἐπιφανής 'manifest god', and, after his defeat of Egypt, Νικηφόρος 'bringer of victory'. H
2 CONC owever, Antiochus also tried to interact with common people, by appearing in the public bath houses and applying for municipal offices, and his often eccentric behavior and capricious actions led some
2 CONC  of his contemporaries to call him Epimanes ("The Mad One"), a word play on his title Epiphanes.

2 CONT <p>Antiochus was of Greek Macedonian and Persian descent. In 210 BC, his father made him joint king, when Antiochus III went off to the East on his great expedition. He was partly in command of the Se
2 CONC leucid army at the victory at Panion in 200 BC. He is not recorded to have had any real independent authority, but he was appointed viceroy of the eastern Seleucid satrapies. Antiochus is named in sev
2 CONC eral decrees and letters with his father. In 200 BC, Antiochus was present at the battle of Panium and received the command over the right wing of the cavalry; it was he who routed the Egyptian cavalr
2 CONC y and attacked the Ptolemaic center from the rear with his victorious cavalry. In 196 BC, Antiochus was appointed as the heir to the Seleucid throne. In that year, his father arranged for him to marry
2 CONC  his younger sister Laodice IV. The marriage between Laodice IV and Antiochus was the first sibling marriage to occur in the Seleucid dynasty. From their sibling union, Laodice IV bore Antiochus a dau

2 CONC s a ruler he was best known for his encouragement of Greek culture and institutions. His attempts to suppress Judaism brought on the Wars of the Maccabees.
2 CONT <p>Early career.</p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus was the third son of Antiochus III the Great. After his father's defeat by the Romans in 190-189, he served as hostage for his father in Rome from 189 to 175, where he learned to admire R
2 CONC oman institutions and policies. His brother, King Seleucus IV, exchanged him for Demetrius, the son of Seleucus; and after Seleucus was murdered by Heliodorus, a usurper, Antiochus in turn ousted him.
2 CONC  During this period ofuncertainty in Syria, the guardians of Ptolemy VI, the Egyptian ruler, laid claim to Coele Syria, Palestine, and Phoenicia, which Antiochus III had conquered. Both the Syrian and
2 CONC  Egyptian parties appealed toRome for help, but the Senate refused to take sides. In 173 Antiochuspaid the remainder of the war indemnity that had been imposed by the Romans on Antiochus III at the Tr
2 CONC eaty of Apamea (188).
2 CONT <p>Antiochus forestalled an Egyptian expedition to Palestine by invadingEgypt. He defeated the Egyptians between Pelusium and Mount Kasion, conquered Pelusium, and in 169 occupied Egypt with the excep
2 CONC tion of Alexandria, the capital. Ptolemy VI was Antiochus' nephew--Antiochus' sister, Cleopatra I, had married Ptolemy V--and Antiochus contented himself with ruling Egypt as Ptolemy's guardian, givin
2 CONC g Rome no excuse for intervention. The citizens of Alexandria, however, appealed to PtolemyVIII, the brother of Ptolemy VI, and to his sister Cleopatra II to form a rival government. Disturbances in P
2 CONC alestine forced Antiochus to return to Syria, but he safeguarded his access to Egypt with a strong garrison in Pelusium.
2 CONT <p>In the winter of 169/168 Perseus of Macedonia in vain begged Antiochus to join forces with him against the danger that Rome presented to all of the Hellenistic monarchs. In Egypt, Ptolemy VI made c
2 CONC ommon causewith his brother and sister and sent a renewed request to Rome for aid, and Antiochus prepared for battle. The fleet of Antiochus won a victory at Cyprus, whose governor surrendered the isl
2 CONC and to him. Antiochus invaded Egypt again in 168, demanded that Cyprus and Pelusium be ceded to him, occupied Lower Egypt, and camped outside Alexandria. The cause of the Ptolemaeans seemed lost. But 
2 CONC on June 22, 168, the Romans defeated Perseus and his Macedonians at Pydna, and there deprived Antiochus of the benefits of his victory. In Eleusis, a suburb of Alexandria, the Roman ambassador, Gaius 
2 CONC Popillius Laenas, presented Antiochus with the ultimatum that he evacuate Egypt and Cyprus immediately. Antiochus, taken by surprise, asked for time to consider. Popillius, however, drew a circle in t
2 CONC he earth around the king with his walking stick and demanded an unequivocal answer before Antiochus left the circle. Dismayed by this public humiliation, the king quickly agreed to comply. Roman inter
2 CONC vention had reestablished the status quo. By being allowed to retain southern Syria, to which Egypt had laid claim, Antiochus wasable to preserve the territorial integrity of his realm.
2 CONT <p>Efforts to hellenize the kingdom.</p>
2 CONT <p>Both economically and socially he made efforts to strengthen his kingdom--inhabited in the main by Orientals (non-Greeks of Asia Minor and Persia)--by founding and fostering Greek cities. Even befo
2 CONC re he had begun his reign he had contributed to the building of the temple of Zeusin Athens and to the adornment of the theatre. He enlarged Antioch onthe Orontes by adding a section to the city (name
2 CONC d Epiphania after him). There he built an aqueduct, a council hall, a marketplace, and a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus. Babylon, which revered him as Soter (Liberator, or Saviour) of Asia, was given a
2 CONC  Greek colony that was grantedfreedom of the city. Another Epiphania was founded in Armenia. Ecbatana (in Persia) was also named Epiphania and became a Greek city. Many of these cities were granted th
2 CONC e right to coin their own municipal currency. The mint of Antioch on the Persian Gulf served the trade along the sea route between India and the district at the mouth of the greatMesopotamian rivers.
2 CONT <p>Antiochus' hellenizing policies brought him into conflict with the prosperous Oriental temple organizations, and particularly with the Jews. Since Antiochus III's reign the Jews had enjoyed extensi
2 CONC ve autonomyunder their high priest. They were divided into two parties, the orthodox Hasideans (Pious Ones) and a reform party that favoured Hellenism. For financial reasons Antiochus supported the re
2 CONC form party and, in return for a considerable sum, permitted the high priest, Jason, to build a gymnasium in Jerusalem and to introduce the Greek mode of educating young people. In 172, for an even big
2 CONC ger tribute, he appointed Menelaus in place of Jason. In 169, however, while Antiochus was campaigning in Egypt, Jason conquered Jerusalem--with the exception of the citadel--and murdered many adheren
2 CONC ts of his rival Menelaus. When Antiochus returned from Egypt in 167 he took Jerusalem by storm and enforced its Hellenization. The city forfeited its privileges and was permanently garrisoned by Syria
2 CONC n soldiers.
2 CONT <p>The revolt of Judas Maccabeus.</p>
2 CONT <p>The Greeks and those friendly toward them were united into the community of Antiochians; the worship of Yahweh and all of the Jewish rites were forbidden on pain of death. In the Temple an altar to
2 CONC  Zeus Olympios was erected, and sacrifices were to be made at the feet of an idol in the image of the King. Against that desecration Judas Maccabeus, leader of the anti-Greek Jews, led the aroused Has
2 CONC ideans in a guerrilla war and several times defeated the generals Antiochus had commissionedto deal with the uprising. Judas refused a partial amnesty, conqueredJudaea with the exception of the Acra i
2 CONC n Jerusalem, and in December 164 was able to tear down the altar of Zeus and reconsecrate the Temple. Antiochus apparently had underestimated the strength of the Hasidean movement, which was behind th
2 CONC e success in maintaining an independent Judaean state for about a century. The fighting spirit of the Jews was all the more impressive because at the beginning of their rebellion in 166 Antiochus had 
2 CONC just demonstrated his might to the world at Daphne, near Antioch, with a grand review of his army: 46,000 foot soldiers were on parade, among them a Macedonian phalanx of 20,000 men and 500 mercenarie
2 CONC s equipped with Roman arms, followed by 8,500 horsemen and 306 armoured elephants.
2 CONT <p>Antiochus then mounted a campaign against the Parthians who were threatening the empire in the east, recovered the income from that area, forced Artaxias of Armenia--who had defected--to recognize 
2 CONC his suzerainty, founded the city of Antioch on the Persian Gulf, set out on an expedition to the Arabian coast, and, at the end of 164, died of an illness at Tabae (or Gabae, probably present Isfahan)
2 CONC  in Persis. Many believers saw his death as a punishment for his attempt to loot the shrine of Nanaia in Elam (in modern Iran).

2 CONC s a ruler he was best known for his encouragement of Greek culture and institutions. His attempts to suppress Judaism brought on the Wars of the Maccabees.
2 CONT <p>Early career.</p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus was the third son of Antiochus III the Great. After his father's defeat by the Romans in 190-189, he served as hostage for his father in Rome from 189 to 175, where he learned to admire R
2 CONC oman institutions and policies. His brother, King Seleucus IV, exchanged him for Demetrius, the son of Seleucus; and after Seleucus was murdered by Heliodorus, a usurper, Antiochus in turn ousted him.
2 CONC  During this period ofuncertainty in Syria, the guardians of Ptolemy VI, the Egyptian ruler, laid claim to Coele Syria, Palestine, and Phoenicia, which Antiochus III had conquered. Both the Syrian and
2 CONC  Egyptian parties appealed toRome for help, but the Senate refused to take sides. In 173 Antiochuspaid the remainder of the war indemnity that had been imposed by the Romans on Antiochus III at the Tr
2 CONC eaty of Apamea (188).
2 CONT <p>Antiochus forestalled an Egyptian expedition to Palestine by invadingEgypt. He defeated the Egyptians between Pelusium and Mount Kasion, conquered Pelusium, and in 169 occupied Egypt with the excep
2 CONC tion of Alexandria, the capital. Ptolemy VI was Antiochus' nephew--Antiochus' sister, Cleopatra I, had married Ptolemy V--and Antiochus contented himself with ruling Egypt as Ptolemy's guardian, givin
2 CONC g Rome no excuse for intervention. The citizens of Alexandria, however, appealed to PtolemyVIII, the brother of Ptolemy VI, and to his sister Cleopatra II to form a rival government. Disturbances in P
2 CONC alestine forced Antiochus to return to Syria, but he safeguarded his access to Egypt with a strong garrison in Pelusium.
2 CONT <p>In the winter of 169/168 Perseus of Macedonia in vain begged Antiochus to join forces with him against the danger that Rome presented to all of the Hellenistic monarchs. In Egypt, Ptolemy VI made c
2 CONC ommon causewith his brother and sister and sent a renewed request to Rome for aid, and Antiochus prepared for battle. The fleet of Antiochus won a victory at Cyprus, whose governor surrendered the isl
2 CONC and to him. Antiochus invaded Egypt again in 168, demanded that Cyprus and Pelusium be ceded to him, occupied Lower Egypt, and camped outside Alexandria. The cause of the Ptolemaeans seemed lost. But 
2 CONC on June 22, 168, the Romans defeated Perseus and his Macedonians at Pydna, and there deprived Antiochus of the benefits of his victory. In Eleusis, a suburb of Alexandria, the Roman ambassador, Gaius 
2 CONC Popillius Laenas, presented Antiochus with the ultimatum that he evacuate Egypt and Cyprus immediately. Antiochus, taken by surprise, asked for time to consider. Popillius, however, drew a circle in t
2 CONC he earth around the king with his walking stick and demanded an unequivocal answer before Antiochus left the circle. Dismayed by this public humiliation, the king quickly agreed to comply. Roman inter
2 CONC vention had reestablished the status quo. By being allowed to retain southern Syria, to which Egypt had laid claim, Antiochus wasable to preserve the territorial integrity of his realm.
2 CONT <p>Efforts to hellenize the kingdom.</p>
2 CONT <p>Both economically and socially he made efforts to strengthen his kingdom--inhabited in the main by Orientals (non-Greeks of Asia Minor and Persia)--by founding and fostering Greek cities. Even befo
2 CONC re he had begun his reign he had contributed to the building of the temple of Zeusin Athens and to the adornment of the theatre. He enlarged Antioch onthe Orontes by adding a section to the city (name
2 CONC d Epiphania after him). There he built an aqueduct, a council hall, a marketplace, and a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus. Babylon, which revered him as Soter (Liberator, or Saviour) of Asia, was given a
2 CONC  Greek colony that was grantedfreedom of the city. Another Epiphania was founded in Armenia. Ecbatana (in Persia) was also named Epiphania and became a Greek city. Many of these cities were granted th
2 CONC e right to coin their own municipal currency. The mint of Antioch on the Persian Gulf served the trade along the sea route between India and the district at the mouth of the greatMesopotamian rivers.
2 CONT <p>Antiochus' hellenizing policies brought him into conflict with the prosperous Oriental temple organizations, and particularly with the Jews. Since Antiochus III's reign the Jews had enjoyed extensi
2 CONC ve autonomyunder their high priest. They were divided into two parties, the orthodox Hasideans (Pious Ones) and a reform party that favoured Hellenism. For financial reasons Antiochus supported the re
2 CONC form party and, in return for a considerable sum, permitted the high priest, Jason, to build a gymnasium in Jerusalem and to introduce the Greek mode of educating young people. In 172, for an even big
2 CONC ger tribute, he appointed Menelaus in place of Jason. In 169, however, while Antiochus was campaigning in Egypt, Jason conquered Jerusalem--with the exception of the citadel--and murdered many adheren
2 CONC ts of his rival Menelaus. When Antiochus returned from Egypt in 167 he took Jerusalem by storm and enforced its Hellenization. The city forfeited its privileges and was permanently garrisoned by Syria
2 CONC n soldiers.
2 CONT <p>The revolt of Judas Maccabeus.</p>
2 CONT <p>The Greeks and those friendly toward them were united into the community of Antiochians; the worship of Yahweh and all of the Jewish rites were forbidden on pain of death. In the Temple an altar to
2 CONC  Zeus Olympios was erected, and sacrifices were to be made at the feet of an idol in the image of the King. Against that desecration Judas Maccabeus, leader of the anti-Greek Jews, led the aroused Has

1 NOTE Antiochus IV Epiphanes
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus IV Epiphanes (??t????? ?p?fa???, Greek: Manifest) ("The Shining One") (c. 215–163 BC, reigned 175–163 BC) was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire. He was originally named Mithr
2 CONC adates, but renamed Antiochus, either upon his ascension, or after the death of his elder brother Antiochus. Epiphanies was simply a common epithet that many leaders used meaning divine, some people r
2 CONC eferred to him as Epimanes meaning madman. He was a son of Antiochus III the Great and brother of Seleucus IV Philopator.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus took power after the death of Seleucus Philopator. He had been hostage in Rome following the peace of Apamea in 188 BC, but had recently been exchanged for the son and rightful heir of Se
2 CONC leucus IV, the later Demetrius I Soter. Antiochus took advantage of this situation, and proclaimed himself co-regent with another of Seleucus' sons, the infant Antiochus, whose murder he orchestrated 
2 CONC a few years later.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Notable events during his reign include the near-conquest of Egypt, which was halted by the threat of Roman intervention, and the beginning of the Jewish revolt of the Maccabees.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Because the guardians of Ptolemy VI of Egypt were demanding the return of Coele-Syria, Antiochus, in 170 BC, decided on a preemptive strike against Egypt, and invaded, conquering all but Alexandria
2 CONC . He then captured Ptolemy, and agreed to let him continue as King, but as his puppet. (This had the advantage of not alarming Rome.) Alexandria thereupon chose Ptolemy's brother Ptolemy Euergetes as 
2 CONC King. In Antiochus' absence, the two brothers agreed to rule jointly. Hence, in 168 BC, Antiochus again invaded, and overran all Egypt, except for Alexandria, while his fleet captured Cyprus. Near Ale
2 CONC xandria he was met by Gaius Popillius Laenas, who told him that he must immediately withdraw from Egypt and Cyprus. Antiochus said he would discuss it with his council, whereupon the envoy drew a line
2 CONC  round him in the sand, and said, "Think about it here." The implication was that, were he to step out of the circle without having first undertaken to withdraw, he would be at war with Rome. Antiochu
2 CONC s agreed to withdraw.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In a spirit of revenge, he organized an expedition against Jerusalem, which he destroyed; he put many of its inhabitants to death most cruelly. From this time, the Jews began the war of independenc
2 CONC e under their Maccabean leaders, defeating the armies that Antiochus sent against them. Enraged at this, Antiochus is said to have marched against them in person, threatening to exterminate the nation
2 CONC ; but, on the way, he was suddenly arrested by the hand of death (164 BC). The exact causes of the Jewish revolt, and of Antiochus' response to it, are uncertain; the Jewish accounts are in the Books 
2 CONC of Maccabees, and the successful revolt is commemorated by the holiday of Hanukkah. His last years were spent on a campaign against the rising Parthian empire, which seems to have been initially succe
2 CONC ssful, but which terminated upon his death.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The reign of Antiochus was a last period of strength for the empire, but in some way it was fatal; since he was an usurper, and left his infant son Antiochus V Eupator as his successor, devastating
2 CONC  dynastic wars followed his death.
2 CONT <p></p>

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus V Eupator (c. 173 BC - 162 BC), was a ruler of the Greek Seleucid Empire who reigned 164-162 BC. He was only nine when he succeeded to the kingship, following the death in Persia of his f
2 CONC ather Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Regent for the boy was the general Lysias who had been left in charge of Syria by Epiphanes. Lysias was however seriously challenged by other generals and was therefore i
2 CONC n a precarious situation. To make matters worse, the Roman senate kept Demetrius, the son of Seleucus IV and the rightful heir to the throne, as a hostage. By threatening to release him, the senate co
2 CONC uld easily control the Seleucid government.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The attempt to check the Jewish rebellion ended in a weak compromise despite a military victory for the still very fearsome Seleucid army. A Roman embassy now travelled along the cities of Syria an

2 CONT <p>In 103 BC, he was on a committee to supervise the implementation of the Lex frumentaria, an agrarian bill, proposed by tribune Lucius Appuleius Saturninus. Strabo became a pontifex in 99 BC; a quae

2 CONT <p>*Anywhere from 245 BC to 239 BC, her mother and Seleucus II arranged for her to marry King Mithridates II of Pontus.[2][3] Laodice married Mithridates II, as a part of a political alliance between 
2 CONC the Seleucid Empire and the Kingdom of Pontus. In 245 BC, her mother and Seleucus II were in the Third Syrian War. To gain support from the Kingdom of Pontus, Laodice was given to Mithridates II in ma
2 CONC rriage and as a marriage gift, Phrygia was transferred as well.[4]
2 CONT <p>*Through her marriage Laodice became Queen of Pontus. Mithridates’ marriage to Laodice was one of the most important features in his reign and was an ambitious marriage policy he initiated.[5] Th

2 CONC Hellenistic world.[6] This marriage also strengthened the pro-Seleucid orientation in foreign policy of Pontus.[7]
2 CONT <p>*The marriage occurred early in the reign of '''Seleucus II Callinicus''', so he could secure Anatolia behind him, so that Seleucus II could turn his attention to war with the Egyptian Greek Pharao

2 CONT <p>Laodice (flourished between second half 3rd century BC and first half 2nd century BC) was a Greek Princess from the Seleucid Empire and the wife of the King Mithridates III of Pontus. Laodice appea
2 CONC rs to have come from obscure origins. Laodice could have been a supposed daughter of the Seleucid King Antiochus IV Epiphanes. This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who ap
2 CONC peared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates III. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this ma

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Antiochus III the Great, (Greek Ἀντίoχoς Μέγας; ca. 241–187 BC, ruled 222–187 BC), younger son of Seleucus II Callinicus, became the 6th ruler of the Seleucid Empire as
2 CONC  a youth of about eighteen in 223 BC. Ascending the throne at young age, Antiochus was an ambitious ruler. Although his early attempts in war against the Ptolemaic Kingdom were unsuccessful, in the fo
2 CONC llowing years of conquest Antiochus proved himself as the most successful Seleucid King after Seleucus I himself. His traditional designation, the Great, reflects an epithet he briefly assumed after h
2 CONC is Eastern Campaign (it appears in regnal formulas at Amyzon in 203 and 202 BC, but not later). Antiochos also assumed the title "Basileus Megas" (which is Greek for Great King), the traditional title
2 CONC  of the Persian kings, which he adopted after his conquest of Koile Syria.

2 CONT <p>The 6th ruler of the Seleucid Empire, Antiochus III the Great (Greek: Ἀντίoχoς Μέγας; ca. 241–187 BC, ruled 222–187 BC) Seleucid Greek king[1][2][3] ruled over Greater Syria and wes

2 CONT <p>Antiochus III was a member of the Greek-Macedonian Seleucid dynasty,[6][7][8][9] he was the son of king Seleucus II and Laodice II and was born in 242 BC near Susa in Iran.[10] Antiochus succeeded 
2 CONC his brother Seleucus III as the king of the Seleucid Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus III inherited a disorganized state. Not only had Asia Minor become detached, but the easternmost provinces had broken away, Bactria under the Greek Diodotus of Bactria, and Parthia under 
2 CONC the nomad chieftain Arsaces. Soon after Antiochus's accession, Media and Persis revolted under their governors, the brothers Molon and Alexander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The young king, under the baneful influence of the minister Hermeias, authorised an attack on Ptolemaic Syria instead of going in person to face the rebels. The attack against Egypt of the Ptolemie
2 CONC s proved a fiasco, and the generals sent against Molon and Alexander met with disaster. Only in Asia Minor, where the king's cousin, the able Achaeus represented the Seleucid cause, did its prestige r

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiokos III var et medlem av det gresk-makedonske selevkiddynastiet.[6][7] Han var den yngre sønnen av Selevkos II Kallinikos og Laodike II, og ble født ca. 242 f.Kr. i nærheten av Susa i det s
2 CONC om i dag er Iran.[8] Han etterfulgte sin bror Selevkos III Keraunos i 223 f.Kr. som konge av Selevkideriket.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Han arvet et uorganisert og kaotisk rike. Ikke bare hadde Anatolia blitt løsrevet, men de østlige provinsene hadde brutt ut, Baktria under greske Diodotos, og Partia under høvdingen Arsakes. Kor
2 CONC t tid etter at han kom på tronen gjorde Media og Persis opprør under sine satraper (guvernører), brødrene Molon og Aleksander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den unge kongen, under skadelig innflytelse fra ministeren Hermeias (som han arvet fra sin fars styre), ledet et angrep mot ptolemeisk Syria framfor å møte opprørerne personlig. Angrepet mot Egy
2 CONC pt ble en fiasko og de hærene som ble sendt mot Molon og Aleksander ble en katastrofe. Kun i Anatolia hvor kongens fetter, den dyktige hærføreren Akaios, representerte Selevkiderikets sak, var det 
2 CONC klare bedringer. Han fordrev styrkene til Pergamon tilbake til dets tidligere grenser.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I 221 f.Kr. dro Antiokos III til sist østover og opprøret til Molon og Aleksander falt sammen, noe historikeren Polybios har tilskrevet delvis til at han fulgte rådene til hærføreren Zeuxis fr
2 CONC amfor å lytte til Hermeias.[9] Underkastelsen av Media, som hadde tatt uavhengighet under Artabazanes, fulgte. Antiokos III kvittet seg med Hermeias ved å få ham myrdet og dro tilbake til Syria i 2
2 CONC 20 f.Kr. I mellomtiden hadde Akaios selv gjort opprør og tatt tittelen som konge i Anatolia. Ettersom hans makt ikke var godt nok fundert til å kunne angripe Syria, besluttet Antiokos å la ham vær
2 CONC e for øyeblikket og gjorde et nytt forsøk på å gjenerobre ptolemeiske Syria.

2 CONC gangen han hittil hadde hatt og tvang ham til å trekke seg tilbake til nord for dagens Libanon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I 216 f.Kr. marsjerte Antiokos' hær inn i vestlige Anatolia for å slå ned det lokal opprøret som var ledet av hans fetter Akaios, og ved 214 f.Kr. hadde han drevet ham fra området og til Sardi
2 CONC s. Etter å ha tatt fetteren til fange ble han henrettet. Festningen greide å holde ut fram til 213 f.Kr. under Akaios' enke Leodike som overga senere.[10]

2 CONT <p>Etter å ha gjenvunnet de sentrale delene av Anatolia (mens han måtte tolerere kongedømmene i Pergamon, Bitynia, og Kappadokia), vendte Antiokos seg mot å gjenvinne de fjerntliggende provinsene 
2 CONC i nord og øst. Han tvang Xerxes av Armenia til å anerkjenne hans overherredømme i 212 f.Kr. I 209 hadde han invadert Partia, okkupert hovedstaden Hekatompylos (i dag byen Schahr-e Qumis i Iran) og

2 CONT <p>Antiokos synes å ha gjenopprettet Selevkideriket i øst, noe som skaffet ham tittelen «den store» (Antiochos Megas). Også i 205/204 f.Kr. etterfulgte Ptolemaios V Epifanes som kun et spedbarn p

2 CONC  Egypt. Men denne gjenerobringen var kortvarig. I 198 f.Kr. klarte Antiokos å beseire Skopas i slaget ved Paneion (i nærheten av Banias/Paneas ved foten av Hermonfjellet). Dette nederlaget betydde s

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I 192 f.Kr. invaderte Antiokos Hellas med en hær på 10 000 menn og ble derfor valgt til øverstkommanderende av det aitoliske forbundet. Antiokos skulle bli den store greske frigjøreren. [14] I 
2 CONC 191 f.Kr. møtte han romerne, ledet av Manius Acilius Glabrio, som lyktes avskjære Antiokos fra sine forsterkninger i Trakia, og møtte ham til slag ved Thermopylene. Romerne hadde en styrke som var 
2 CONC dobbelt så stor, og med sine gjenværende tropper klarte Antiokos å flykte til Khalkis på Euboia, og derfra dro han over havet til Efesos. Romerne fulgte opp sin suksess med å invadere Antaolia, o

2 CONT <p>Med den ydmykende freden i Apameia i 188 f.Kr. ble Antiokos III tvunget til å oppgi alle sine erobringer i Europa, alt land vest for Taurusfjellene i Anatolia, overgi hele sine flåte med unntak a
2 CONC v tolv triremer, overgi alle sine krigselefanter, og betale en krigserstatning på 15 000 sølvtalenter. De landområdene i Anatolia ble fordelt blant Romas allierte. En annen konsekvens av dette nede
2 CONC rlaget i vest var at alle de fjerne provinsene i øst som Antiokos hadde sikret seg, igjen grep anledningen av det svekkede Selevkideriket med å erklære sin uavhengighet. Antiokos dro på et ny mili

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus III the Great (Greek: Ἀντίoχoς Μέγας; c. 241-187 BC, ruled 222-187 BC) was a Hellenistic Greek king and the 6th ruler of the Seleucid Empire. He ruled over the region of Syria
2 CONC  and large parts of the rest of western Asia towards the end of the 3rd century BC. Rising to the throne at the age of eighteen in 222 BC, his early campaigns against the Ptolemaic Kingdom were unsucc
2 CONC essful, but in the following years Antiochus gained several military victories and substantially expanded the empire's territory. His traditional designation, the Great, reflects an epithet he assumed
2 CONC . He also assumed the title Basileus Megas (Greek for "Great King"), the traditional title of the Persian kings. A militarily active ruler, Antiochus restored much of the territory of the Seleucid Emp
2 CONC ire, before suffering a serious setback, towards the end of his reign, in his war against Rome.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Declaring himself the "champion of Greek freedom against Roman domination", Antiochus III waged a four-year war against the Roman Republic in mainland Greece in autumn of 192 BC before being decisi
2 CONC vely defeated at the Battle of Magnesia. He died three years later on campaign in the east.

2 CONT <p>'''Biography'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Background and early career''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus III was a member of the Hellenistic Greek Seleucid dynasty. He was the son of king Seleucus II Callinicus and Laodice II and was born around 242 BC near Susa in Persia. He may have borne 
2 CONC a non-dynastic name (starting with Ly-), according to a Babylonian chronicle. He succeeded, under the name Antiochus, his brother Seleucus III Ceraunus, upon the latter's murder in Anatolia; he was in
2 CONC  Babylon at the time.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus III inherited a disorganized state. Not only had Asia Minor become detached, but the easternmost provinces had broken away, Bactria under the Greek Diodotus of Bactria, and Parthia under 
2 CONC the nomad chieftain Arsaces. Soon after Antiochus's accession, Media and Persis revolted under their governors, the brothers Molon and Alexander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The young king, under the influence of the minister Hermeias, headed an attack on Ptolemaic Syria instead of going in person to face the rebels. The attack against the Ptolemaic empire proved a fia
2 CONC sco, and the generals sent against Molon and Alexander met with disaster. Only in Asia Minor, where the king's cousin, Achaeus, represented the Seleucid cause, did its prestige recover, driving the Pe
2 CONC rgamene power back to its earlier limits.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 221 BC Antiochus at last went east, and the rebellion of Molon and Alexander collapsed which Polybios attributes in part to his following the advice of Zeuxis rather than Hermeias. The submissio
2 CONC n of Lesser Media, which had asserted its independence under Artabazanes, followed. Antiochus rid himself of Hermeias by assassination and returned to Syria (220 BC). Meanwhile, Achaeus himself had re
2 CONC volted and assumed the title of king in Asia Minor. Since, however, his power was not well enough grounded to allow an attack on Syria, Antiochus considered that he might leave Achaeus for the present
2 CONC  and renew his attempt on Ptolemaic Syria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Early wars against other Hellenistic rulers'' The campaigns of 219 BC and 218 BC carried the Seleucid armies almost to the confines of Ptolemaic Kingdom, but in 217 BC Ptolemy IV defeated Antioch
2 CONC us at the Battle of Raphia. This defeat nullified all Antiochus's successes and compelled him to withdraw north of the Lebanon. Despite the military defeat, Antiochus was able to keep control of Seleu
2 CONC cia pieria.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 216 BC Antiochus' army marched into western Anatolia to suppress the local rebellion led by Antiochus' own cousin Achaeus, and had by 214 BC driven him from the field into Sardis. Capturing Acha
2 CONC eus, Antiochus had him executed. The citadel managed to hold out until 213 BC under Achaeus' widow Laodice who surrendered later.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Having thus recovered the central part of Asia Minor (for the Seleucid government had perforce to tolerate the dynasties in Pergamon, Bithynia and Cappadocia) Antiochus turned to recovering the out
2 CONC lying provinces of the north and east. He obliged Xerxes of Armenia to acknowledge his supremacy in 212 BC. In 209 BC Antiochus invaded Parthia, occupied the capital Hecatompylos and pushed forward in
2 CONC to Hyrcania. The Parthian king Arsaces II apparently successfully sued for peace.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Bactrian campaign and Indian expedition''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The year 209 BC saw Antiochus in Bactria, where the Greco-Bactrian king Euthydemus I had supplanted the original rebel. Antiochus again met with success. Euthydemus was defeated by Antiochus at the
2 CONC  Battle of the Arius but after sustaining a famous siege in his capital Bactra (Balkh), he obtained an honourable peace by which Antiochus promised Euthydemus' son Demetrius the hand of one of his dau
2 CONC ghters.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus next, following in the steps of Alexander, crossed into the Kabul valley, reaching the realm of Indian king Sophagasenus and returned west by way of Seistan and Kerman (206/5). According 
2 CONC to Polybius:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''He crossed the Caucasus (Hindu Kush) and descended into India; renewed his friendship with Sophagasenus (Subhashsena in Prakrit) the king of the Indians; received more elephants, until he had a h
2 CONC undred and fifty altogether; and having once more provisioned his troops, set out again personally with his army: leaving Androsthenes of Cyzicus the duty of taking home the treasure which this king h
2 CONC ad agreed to hand over to him.''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Persia and Coele Syria campaigns''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From Seleucia on the Tigris he led a short expedition down the Persian Gulf against the Gerrhaeans of the Arabian coast (205 BC/204 BC). Antiochus seemed to have restored the Seleucid empire in the
2 CONC  east, which earned him the title of "the Great" (Antiochos Megas). In 205/204 BC the infant Ptolemy V Epiphanes succeeded to the Egyptian throne, and Antiochus is said (notably by Polybios) to have c
2 CONC oncluded a secret pact with Philip V of Macedon for the partition of the Ptolemaic possessions. Under the terms of this pact, Macedon were to receive the Ptolemaic possessions around the Aegean Sea an
2 CONC d Cyrene, while Antiochus would annex Cyprus and Egypt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Once more Antiochus attacked the Ptolemaic province of Coele Syria and Phoenicia, and by 199 BC he seems to have had possession of it before the Aetolian leader Scopas recovered it for Ptolemy. But
2 CONC  that recovery proved brief, for in 198 BC Antiochus defeated Scopas at the Battle of Panium, near the sources of the Jordan, a battle which marks the end of Ptolemaic rule in Judea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''War against Rome and death''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus then moved to Asia Minor, by land and by sea, to secure the coast towns which belonged to the remnants of Ptolemaic overseas dominions and the independent Greek cities. This enterprise ea
2 CONC rned him the antagonism of the Roman Republic, since Smyrna and Lampsacus appealed to the republic of the west at the time when it was claiming to defend Greek freedom, and the tension grew after Anti
2 CONC ochus had in 196 BC established a footing in Thrace. The evacuation of Greece by the Romans gave Antiochus his opportunity, and he now had the fugitive Hannibal at his court to urge him on.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 192 BC Antiochus invaded Greece with a 10,000 man army, and was elected the commander in chief of the Aetolian League.[16] In 191 BC, however, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him 
2 CONC at Thermopylae, forcing him to withdraw to Asia Minor. The Romans followed up their success by invading Anatolia, and the decisive victory of Scipio Asiaticus at Magnesia ad Sipylum (190 BC), followin
2 CONC g the defeat of Hannibal at sea off Side, delivered Asia Minor into their hands.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By the Treaty of Apamea (188 BC) Antiochus abandoned all the country north and west of the Taurus, most of which the Roman Republic gave either to Rhodes or to the Attalid ruler Eumenes II, its all
2 CONC ies (many Greek cities were left free). As a consequence of this blow to the Seleucid power, the outlying provinces of the empire, recovered by Antiochus, reasserted their independence. Antiochus moun
2 CONC ted a fresh eastern expedition in Luristan, where he died while pillaging a temple of Bel at Elymaïs, Persia, in 187 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Family'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 222 BC, Antiochus III married Princess Laodice of Pontus, a daughter of King Mithridates II of Pontus and Princess Laodice of the Seleucid Empire. The couple were first cousins through their mut
2 CONC ual grandfather, Antiochus II Theos. Antiochus and Laodice had eight children (three sons and five daughters):
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p># Antiochus (221–193 BC), Antiochus III's first heir apparent and joint-king with his father from 210–193 BC</p>
2 CONT <p># Seleucus IV Philopator (c. 220 – 175 BC), Antiochus III's successor</p>
2 CONT <p># Ardys</p>
2 CONT <p># unnamed daughter, betrothed in about 206 BC to Demetrius I of Bactria</p>
2 CONT <p># Laodice IV, married all three of her brothers in succession and became Queen of the Seleucid Empire through her second and third marriages</p>
2 CONT <p># Cleopatra I Syra (c. 204 – 176 BC), married in 193 BC Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt</p>
2 CONT <p># Antiochis, married in 194 BC King Ariarathes IV of Cappadocia</p>
2 CONT <p># Mithridates (215–164 BC), succeeded his brother Seleucus IV Philopator in 175 BC under the regnal name Antiochus IV Epiphanes</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 191 BC, Antiochus III married a girl from Chalcis, whom he named "Euboea". They had no children. Laodike III may have fallen in disgrace; however, she clearly survived Antiochus III, and appears
2 CONC  in Susa in 183 BC</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Antiochus and the Jews'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus III resettled 2000 Jewish families from Babylonia into the Hellenistic Anatolian regions of Lydia and Phrygia. He is not the king of the Hanukkah story who was resisted by the Maccabees; 
2 CONC rather, that was his son, Antiochus IV. On the contrary, Josephus portrays him as friendly towards the Jews of Jerusalem and cognizant of their loyalty to him (see Antiquities, chapter 3, sections 3-4
2 CONC ), in stark contrast to the attitude of his son. In fact, Antiochus III lowered taxes, granted subventions to the Temple, and let the Jews live, as Josephus puts it, "according to the law of their for
2 CONC efathers."
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Cultural portrayals'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Caroline era play Believe as You List is centered around Antiochus' resistance to the Romans after the Battle of Thermopylae. The play was originally about Sebastian of Portugal surviving the B
2 CONC attle of Alcazar and returning, trying to gather support to return to the throne. This first version was censored for being considered "subversive" because it portrayed Sebastian being deposed, its co
2 CONC mments in favor of an Anglo-Spanish alliance and possible pro-Catholicism, which led to the final version changing to the story of Antiochus (which led to historical inaccuracy in exaggerating his def
2 CONC eat at that phase in history to fit the earlier text), turning Spaniards into Romans and the Catholic eremite into a Stoic philosopher.

2 CONT <p>Laodice (flourished 3rd century BC) was a Greek Princess of the Seleucid Empire. Laodice was of Greek Macedonian and Persian descent. She was one of the daughters and youngest child born to the Sel
2 CONC eucid Monarchs Antiochus II Theos and Laodice I. Among her siblings were her brothers Seleucus II Callinicus and Antiochus Hierax. Laodice was born and raised in the Seleucid Empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Anywhere from 245 BC to 239 BC, her mother and Seleucus II arranged for her to marry King Mithridates II of Pontus. Laodice married Mithridates II, as a part of a political alliance between the Sel
2 CONC eucid Empire and the Kingdom of Pontus. In 245 BC, her mother and Seleucus II were in the Third Syrian War Third Syrian War. To gain support from the Kingdom of Pontus, Laodice was given to Mithridate
2 CONC s II in marriage and as a marriage gift, Phrygia was transferred as well.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Through her marriage Laodice became Queen of Pontus. Mithridates’ marriage to Laodice was one of the most important features in his reign and was an ambitious marriage policy he initiated. Throug
2 CONC h his political alliance and marriage to Laodice, Mithridates II allied himself to the most important royal house in Asia and gaining impressive recognition for Pontus as a political power in the Hell
2 CONC enistic world. This marriage also strengthened the pro-Seleucid orientation in foreign policy of Pontus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The marriage occurred early in the reign of Seleucus II Callinicus, so he could secure Anatolia behind him, so that Seleucus II could turn his attention to war with the Egyptian Greek Pharaoh Ptole
2 CONC my III Euergetes. At some point, Laodice may have influenced Mithridates II by her desire to weaken the Seleucid state, by supporting her first brother Seleucus II Callinicus in joint rule with her ot
2 CONC her brother Antiochus Hierax, who were at civil war with each other. Laodice bore Mithridates II three children, two daughters: Laodice III, Laodice of Pontus and a son Mithridates III of Pontus.

2 CONC tiske Selevkideriket og styrte fra 246 f.Kr. til 225 f.Kr.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det er uklart når han ble født, muligens en gang rundt 265 f.Kr. Etter at hans far Antiokos II Theos var død, ble Selevkos utropt som konge av sin mor Laodike I i Efesos. Hun hadde samtidig latt
2 CONC  sine egne folk i byen Antiokia ved Orontes drepe Antikos' andre hustru Berenike og hennes lille sønn. Berenikes bror var kong Ptolemaios III Euergetes av Egypt. I raseri over søsterens død, erklæ
2 CONC rte han krig og invaderte Selevkideriket. Hans mistanker om dødsårsaken for søsteren og nevøen var ikke grunnløse og var en hovedårsak for den tredje syriske krig, også kalt for den leodikiske 
2 CONC krig. Han marsjerte seierrik helt til Tigris, og kanskje videre også. Selevkiderikets østlige provinser underkastet samtidig som den egyptiske flåten sveipte langs kysten av Anatolia. Han fikk tatt
2 CONC  Laodike I tatt til fange og henrettet henne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos II Kallinikos holdt seg i trygt i innlandet av Anatolia, og da Ptolemaios III til sist vendte tilbake til Egypt, dro Selevkos ned i Syria og gjenopprettet kontrollen over de nordlige og ø
2 CONC stlige provinsene. Imidlertid etablerte hans yngre bror Antiokos Hieraks seg som en rival til tronen i Anatolia med den fraksjonen som tilhørte moren Laodike.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ved Ankyra en gang rundt 235 f.Kr. gikk Selevkos på et knusende militært nederlag og etterlot landet bortenfor Taurusfjellene til sin bror og andre statsmakter i Anatolia. Selevkos forsøkte dere
2 CONC tter å erobre Partia, men maktet ikke å oppnå noe som helst. I henhold til en del kilder ble han selv tatt til fange og holdt i fangenskap i flere år av den partiske kongen, men det kan være en s
2 CONC ammenblanding med en senere historisk konge. Andre kilder nevner at han etablerte en fredsavtale med Arsakes I av Partia som anerkjente (i navnet) hans overherredømme.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I Anatolia blomstret den greske byen Pergamon ved kysten av Egeerhavet og ble en betydelig maktfaktor under Attalos. Antiokos Hieraks forsøkte, uten lykkes, å ta sin brors besittelser da hans egn
2 CONC e forsvant hen, og endte opp som en flyktning i Trakia i 228 eller 227 f.Kr. Rundt et år senere ble Selevkos drept da han ramlet av hesten.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos II Kallinikos hadde giftet seg med sin kusine Laodike II, datter av Andromakos. Selevkos fikk fem barn med henne, to døtre og tre sønnene, og av disse var blant annet Selevkos III Keraun
2 CONC os og Antiokos III den store. Han ble etterfulgt av sin eldste sønn Selevkos III, og deretter av sin yngre sønn, Antiokos III. Hans ene datter, nevnt som Antiokis, ble gift med Xerxes av Armenia, me

2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus II Callinicus or Pogon (the epithets meaning "beautiful victor" and "bearded", respectively), was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire, who reigned from 246 to 225 BC. He was proclai
2 CONC med king by his mother, Laodice, while her partisans at Antioch murdered Berenice and her son.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy III, who was Berenice's brother and the ruler of Egypt, invaded the Seleucid Empire and marched victoriously to the Tigris or beyond. He received the submission of the Seleucid Empire's eas
2 CONC tern provinces, while Egyptian fleets swept the coast of Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus managed to maintain himself in the interior of Asia Minor. When Ptolemy returned to Egypt, Seleucus recovered Northern Syria and the nearer provinces of Iran. However, Antiochus Hierax, a 
2 CONC younger brother of Seleucus, was set up as a rival in Asia Minor against Seleucus by a party to which Laodice herself adhered.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At Ancyra (about 235 BC) Seleucus sustained a crushing defeat and left the country beyond the Taurus to his brother and the other powers of the peninsula. Seleucus then undertook an anabasis to reg
2 CONC ain Parthia, the results of which came to nothing. According to some sources, he was even taken prisoner for several years by the Parthian king. Other sources mention that he established a peace with 
2 CONC Arsaces I, who recognized his soverignty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In Asia Minor, Pergamon now rose to greatness under Attalus I. Antiochus Hierax, after a failed attempt to seize his brother's dominions when his own were vanishing, perished as a fugitive in Thrac
2 CONC e in 228 or 227 BC.</p>

2 CONC iladelphus of Egypt in 250 BC) he agreed to marry '''Berenice''', Ptolemy II's daughter; and declared his eldest son by Berenice his heir.
2 CONT <p>According to Eusebius, Laodice I was a daughter of '''Achaeus''', and thereby, sister of '''Antiochis''', the mother of '''Attalus I, king of Pergamus'''. When Ptolemy died in 246 BC, Antiochus too
2 CONC k Laodice back but died immediately thereafter (she is said to have poisoned him). Berenice's son was less than four years old, and Laodice argued that her eldest son, Seleucus, had been named heir to
2 CONC  the throne by Antiochus on his deathbed. Laodice had Berenice and her son murdered, which began the Third Syrian War (also known as the Laodicean War) between the newly crowned Seleucus and Ptolemy I
2 CONC II of Egypt, Berenice's brother.
2 CONT <p>During the course of this war, Laodice attempted to take control over the Empire by insisting that Seleucus make his younger brother Antiochus Hierax co-regent and give him all Seleucid territory i

2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice I (flourished 3rd century BC, died before 236 BC) was an Anatolian noblewoman who was a close relative of the early Seleucid dynasty and was the first wife of the Seleucid Greek King Antioc
2 CONC hus II Theos.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Family Background'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Laodice was a woman of Greek Macedonian and Persian descent. According to Eusebius of Caesarea (1.251), she was a daughter of Achaeus by an unnamed Greek mother. Her father Achaeus was a wealthy no
2 CONC bleman who owned estates in Anatolia. Her family had power in Anatolia with strong royal connections. She had one sister, Antiochis, and two brothers, Alexander and Andromachus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Her father Achaeus was the second son of King Seleucus I Nicator and his first wife Apama I. Her name implies a strong Seleucid connection, as she was the namesake of her paternal aunt and her pate
2 CONC rnal great grandmother of this name.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Life and marriage'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Her birth date is unknown, and little is known on her early life. Laodice I married her paternal first cousin Antiochus II Theos before 266 BC as his first wife. She married Antiochus II before he 
2 CONC was the heir to the Seleucid throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When her paternal uncle Antiochus I Soter died in 261 BC, Antiochus II succeeded his father. Through her marriage, Laodice I became a Seleucid queen. Little is known on her relationship with Antioc
2 CONC hus II. Laodice I bore her husband two sons: Seleucus II Callinicus and Antiochus Hierax, and three daughters: Apama, Stratonice of Cappadocia and Laodice.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Divorce with Antiochus II'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 252 BC after the Second Syrian War, Antiochus II was obliged to make peace with the Egyptian Greek Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus. Antiochus made peace with the Pharaoh by divorcing Laodice and
2 CONC  marrying the daughter of Ptolemy II, Berenice, with the understanding that any children born from their union would inherit the Seleucid throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although she was no longer queen, Laodice was still a very powerful and political influential figure. In their divorce settlement, Antiochus gave Laodice various land grants throughout Anatolia whi
2 CONC ch are known through inscriptions. Laodice I owned a large estate in the Hellespont, other properties near Cyzicus, Ilion and in Caria. In a royal record at Sardis mentions her land titles were to be 
2 CONC kept as royal land in disposal in grants or sales.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In a clause in the divorce settlement, Laodice was allowed to sell or donate land in which she had the right to choose which attachment of a city were to be passed on to the new landlord, unless La
2 CONC odice had taken care of the matter herself. Antiochus gave her a grace period to settle matters on her land before she decided whether to hold on to the land or dispose it. She may have been given the
2 CONC  revenue of two harvests with which to pay a nominal purchase price to set at the valuation of the land for tax purposes. When Laodice was able to make payment, the land she intended to purchase could
2 CONC  remain part of royal land and couldn’t be made as a part of an attachment to a city. The only one who could order to reallocate or rearrange land lots was the King.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Laodice sold a land attachment, the new owner was not permitted to remove it from the city or attach it to another. As she was a former queen, as a part of a land sale she possessed everything
2 CONC  on the land that was transferred to her during the sale. She collected revenue from annual agriculture harvests and other forms from her lands. Antiochus, on one occasion, granted Laodice a complete 
2 CONC property tax exemption.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Deaths of Antiochus II and his second family'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During Antiochus II’s marriage to Berenice, she bore him a son called Antiochus. Laodice I lived at Ephesus. On January 28 246 BC, Ptolemy II died, and was succeeded by Ptolemy III Euergetes. Aft
2 CONC er the death of Ptolemy II, Antiochus II left his second family in Antioch and returned to Laodice. He named his first son with Laodice as his successor to the throne.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In July 246 BC, Antiochus II died (some suggest that he was poisoned by a revengeful Laodice) leaving a confusing dynastic situation. Seleucus II succeeded his father as king and his brother Antioc
2 CONC hus Hierax was named co-ruler in Sardis. They lived with Laodice at Ephesus. Laodice, either for revenge or to prevent civil war, had Berenice and her son murdered in the late summer of 246 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Out of his outrage, the brother of Berenice, Ptolemy III declared war and invaded the Seleucid Empire. His suspicions about the deaths of his sister and nephew were firmly grounded and were a part 
2 CONC of the cause of the Third Syrian War also known as the ‘Laodicean War’ or the ‘War of Laodice’. Ptolemy captured Laodice and had her killed. This happened no earlier than 236 BC because there 
2 CONC are two honorific inscriptions in Babylon dedicated to her dated to 247 BC and 237 BC. During the war, while Seleucus was fighting Ptolemy, Laodice supported the revolt of her second son against her f
2 CONC irst son. This occurred in 244 BC which caused a civil war for the next 17 years between Seleucus II and Antiochus Hierax.

2 CONT <p>Antiochus II Theos (Greek: Ἀντίοχος Β΄ ὁ Θεός; 286–246 BC) was a Greek king of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire who reigned from 261 to 246 BC. He succeeded his father Antiochus I
2 CONC  Soter in the winter of 262–61 BC. He was the younger son of Antiochus I and princess Stratonice, the daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He inherited a state of war with Ptolemaic Egypt, the "Second Syrian War", which was fought along the coasts of Asia Minor, and the constant intrigues of petty despots and restless city-states in A
2 CONC sia Minor. Antiochus also made some attempt to get a footing in Thrace. During the war he was given the title Theos (Greek: Θεός, "God"), being such to the Milesians in slaying the tyrant Timarchu
2 CONC s.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During the time Antiochus was occupied with the war against Egypt, Andragoras, his satrap in Parthia, proclaimed independence. According to Justin's epitome of Pompeius Trogus, in Bactria, his satr
2 CONC ap Diodotus also revolted in 255 BC, and founded the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, which further expanded in India in 180 BC to form the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180–1 BC). Then about 238 BC, Arsaces led a rev
2 CONC olt of the Parthians against Andragoras, leading to the foundation of the Parthian Empire. These events would have cut off communications with India. Phylarchus relays current scandals regarding his d

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>About this time, Antiochus made peace with Ptolemy II Philadelphus, ending the Second Syrian War. Antiochus repudiated his wife Laodice I and exiled her to Ephesus. To seal the treaty, he married P

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During her stay in Ephesus, Laodice I continued numerous intrigues to become queen again. By 246 BC Antiochus had left Berenice and their infant son Antiochus, in Antioch to live again with Laodice
2 CONC  I in Asia Minor. Laodice I took the occasion to poison Antiochus while her partisans at Antioch murdered Berenice and their infant son. Antiochus was buried in the Belevi Mausoleum.
2 CONT <p></p>

2 CONT <p>=Andromachus=</p>
2 CONT <p>'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Andromachus (Greek: Aνδρoμαχoς, lived 3rd century BC) was an Anatolian nobleman of Greek Macedonian and Persian descent. Andromachus’ father was a wealthy nobleman who owned estates in Ana
2 CONC tolia and his family had power in Anatolia with strong royal connections. Andromachus was the second son of Achaeus by an unnamed Greek mother and a grandson of Seleucus I Nicator (the founder of the 
2 CONC Seleucid Empire) and his first wife Apama I. He had four siblings; one brother: Alexander and two sisters: Antiochis and Laodice I. He was the father of Achaeus and Laodice II. Laodice II married her 
2 CONC cousin, the Seleucid King Seleucus II Callinicus and they were the parents of Antiochus III the Great.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At some moment in the course of a war between the Seleucids and Egyptian Greek Pharaoh Ptolemy III Euergetes took him prisoner; and when Ptolemy III died in 221 BC, Andromachus was still a prisoner
2 CONC  in Egypt. Since Achaeus had long shown great anxiety to secure his son's release, Ptolemy IV of Egypt’s chief advisor Sosibius, regarded the captive grandee as a very valuable piece to play in the 
2 CONC political game. He had, perhaps, before the revolt of Achaeus, tried to strike a bargain with him-—the release of Andromachus as the price of Achaeus deserting his king. When Achaeus had once revolt
2 CONC ed, pushed by other circumstances, and without having made any compact with Egypt, there was the less reason to let Andromachus go. Sosibius was very unwilling to part with such a valuable asset; but 
2 CONC around 220 BC the Rhodians exerted themselves as intercessors on behalf of Achaeus, changing radically the situation.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Rhodians decision did not spring from altruism: it was a move with which they hoped to defeat the city-state of Byzantium, with which they were at war. Byzantium hoped to gain Achaeus' support 
2 CONC against Rhodes and its allies; by obtaining Andromachus release the Rhodians planned to foil this design and obtain Achaeus' benevolence. They therefore sent an embassy to Ptolemy IV asking him to del
2 CONC iver this Andromachus to them. This request they had made before, but without laying any great stress upon it. Now, however, they put much more insistence upon it; and while Ptolemy at first refused t
2 CONC o free Andromachus, on second thoughts, being anxious to please the Rhodians, the king yielded to their request, and handed over Andromachus to them to conduct to his son. This was done, and father an
2 CONC d son were reunited. After this occurrence, Andromachus disappears from history.

1 NOTE PRINCE OF CIUS/CIOS; d. 363 BC
1 NOTE {geni:about_me} https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridates_I_of_Pontus
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates I Ctistes (in Greek Mιθριδάτης Kτίστης; reigned 281–266 BCE), also known as Mithridates III of Cius, was a Persian nobleman and the founder (this is the meaning of the 
2 CONC word Ctistes, literally Builder) of the Kingdom of Pontus in Anatolia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Mithridates is said to have been of the same age as Demetrios Poliorketes, which means he was born in the mid-330s BCE. In 302 or 301 BC, shortly after having executed the young man's father and pr
2 CONC edecessor Mithridates II of Cius, the diadoch Antigonus became suspicious of the son who had inherited the family dominion of Cius, and planned to kill the boy. Mithridates, however, received from Dem
2 CONC etrius Poliorketes timely notice of Antigonus's intentions, and fled with a few followers to Paphlagonia, where he occupied a strong fortress, called Cimiata. He was joined by numerous bodies of troop
2 CONC s from different quarters and gradually extended his dominions in Pontus and created the foundations for the birth of a new kingdom, which may be judged to have risen about 281 BCE when Mithridates as
2 CONC sumed the title of basileus (king). In the same year, we find him concluding an alliance with the town of Heraclea Pontica in Bithynia, to protect it against Seleucus[5]. At a subsequent period, Mithr
2 CONC idates is found acquiring support from the Gauls (who later settled in Asia Minor) in order to overthrow a force sent against him by Ptolemy, king of Egypt.[6] These are the recorded events of his rei
2 CONC gn, which lasted for thirty-six years. He was succeeded by his son Ariobarzanes. He seems to have been buried in a royal grave near the kingdom's capital, Amasia. Next to him would be buried all the k
2 CONC ings of Pontus until the fall of Sinope in 183 BCE.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Appian, he was eighth in descent from the first satrap of Pontus under Darius the Great and sixth in ascending order from Mithridates Eupator. However, this point is controversial sinc
2 CONC e Plutarch[9] writes that eight generations of kings of Pontus stemmed from him before Roman subjection.
1 NOTE Pontus
2 CONT <p>In ancient times, Pontus was the name of the north-eastern province ofAsia Minor, a long and narrow strip of land on the southern coast of theBlack Sea (Pontus Euxinus), from which the designation 
2 CONC was latertransferred to the country. Before this the province was calledCappadocia on the Pontus. The country was shut in by high and wildmountain ranges, but was exceedingly fertile in the lower part
2 CONC s on thecoast, in the interior, and on the plateaux. It yielded fruit of allkinds, especially cherries, which Lucullus is said to have brought intoEurope from Pontus 72 B. C.; also wine, grain, wood, 
2 CONC honey, wax, etc.,besides iron, steel, and salt. It was inhabited by a number of pettytribes; among these were the Chalybes or Chaldæans, held in high reputeby the Greeks as the first smiths. All belo
2 CONC nged to the Persian empire,but in Xenophon's day (about 400 B. C.) were to a considerable degreeindependent of the Persians. At this date, however, these differentcountries had no common name. Greeks 
2 CONC settled early on the coast, andfounded flourishing commercial cities, as Trapezus (Trebizond), Cerasus,Side, later called Polemonium, Cotyora, Amisus, and Apsarus. The founderof the Kingdom of Pontus 
2 CONC was Mithradates I, son of Prince Mithradates ofCius on the Propontis, who was murdered 302 B. C. Mithradates I, takingadvantage of the confusion caused by the Diadochian Wars, came to Pontuswith only 
2 CONC six horsemen and was able to assume the title of king 296 B.C.; he died in 266 after a reign of thirty-six years. He was followed byAriobarzanes (died about 258 B. C.), Mithradates II (to about 210 B.
2 CONC  C.),Mithradates III (to about 190 B. C.), Pharnaces (to 170 B. C.),Mithradates IV (to about 150 B. C.), Mithradates V (to 121 B. C.), andthen Mithradates VI Eupator, or the Great. The kings, Persian 
2 CONC by descent,formed relations early with Greece and from the beginning Hellenisticculture found an entrance into Pontus. The religion was a mixture ofGreek worships with the old native cults. From the t

2 CONT <p>In Apostolic times Christianity found an entrance into Pontus. The FirstEpistle of Peter is addressed to the Christians in Pontus among others,showing that Christianity had spread to some extent in
2 CONC  this province. Theauthor in his exhortations presupposes relations between the faithful andthe non-Christian population. For the years 111-13 we have the importanttestimony of Pliny, then Governor of
2 CONC  Bithynia and Pontus (Ep. xcvi).Pliny did not mention the cities or villages, and it is uncertain whetherAmastris, or Amasia, or Comana, was the place where Christians were triedby him. As concerns Am
2 CONC isus, Ramsay has proved from Christian sources thatit contained Christians about the year 100. Later Amastris was the chiefChristian community. Eusebius mentions (IV, xxiii) a letter written byBishop 
2 CONC Dionysius of Corinth (about 170) to Amastris, "and the otherchurches in Pontus". There was, therefore, at this era a metropolitanwith several churches. About 240 Gregory Thaumaturgus was consecratedBi
2 CONC shop of Neo-Cæsarea by Phædimus, Bishop of Amasia. It is said that atthat time there were only seventeen Christians in the city and itsvicinity, and that at his death, shortly before 270, only the s
2 CONC ame numberof heathens could be found in the city. The able bishop converted thepeople by opposing Christian to heathen miracles and by changing the oldfeasts into Christian festivals. In the Decian pe
2 CONC rsecution he madeconcessions to human weakness, advised the faithful to be lessaggressive, and fled himself. Comana received a bishop from Gregory.Christianity obtained a foothold also in the Greek ci
2 CONC ties of the coast ofeastern Pontus before 325. In or about the year 315 a great synod washeld at Neo-Cæsarea by Bishop Longinus. At the Council of Nicæa therewere present among others the Bishops of
2 CONC  Amastris, Pompejopolis,Jonopolis, Amasia, Comana, Zela, Trebizond, and Pityus. Towards the endof the fourth century Neo-Cæsarea became itself a Church-province, havingas suffragans Trebizond, Cerasu

1 NOTE parthia.com : Fifth king of Parthia, and the king who established Parthia as an ancient world power. He was the brother of Phraates I, and the son of Phriapatius. He was the father of Phraates II. 
2 CONT <p>We do not know the exact date of his accession, but he is mentioned by Justin [XLI.6] as a contemporary of Bactria's Eucratides and Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Antiochus IV campaigned in Iran to return
2 CONC  the territories lost by Arsaces II. 
2 CONT <p>Mithradates I may have campaigned into Tapuria and Traxiana shortly after succeeding to the throne. The death of Antiochus IV in 164 B.C. would certainly have reduced pressure on Parthia from the w
2 CONC est. From 161 - 155 B.C. Mithradates waged a long war with Media, the success of which was long unsure. The best account appears to be that Timarkhos, Seleucid satrap of Media lost some territory in t
2 CONC he area of Rhagae and farther east, to Mithradates I, while the Seleucid reconquest did not recover this land but did recapture Ecbatana. According to Justin,1  Mithradates I had to fight many times i
2 CONC n Media and Frye2  believes it conceivable that the Seleucids held only the city and the lowlands to the west of Ecbatana at the time the relief at Herakles was carved, approximately 148 B.C. 
2 CONT <p>The acquisition of Media opened the door to Mesopotamia for Parthian expansion into that fertile territory.3  Mithradates entered the royal city of Seleucia and was recognized as King on or before 
2 CONC July 8, 141 B.C. Before October 141 B.C., Mithradates sovereignty was acknowledged as far south as Uruk. But by December, incursions of the  Sakae into Hyrcania forced him away to the east. Mithradate
2 CONC s turned over military command to a Parthian commander and the remainder of his reign was occupied with campaigns in southern and central Parthia.4  Mithradates was no sooner gone than Demetrius retur
2 CONC ned to the attack, joined by Elymais and Persis (and perhaps Bactrian troops), but Demetrius was soon captured and sent to Mithradates in Hyrcania. He was well treated, however, and given Rhodogune, M
2 CONC ithradates' daughter, in marriage. As punishment for joining Demetrius against the Parthians, Elymais was looted, where the temples of Artemis and Athena yielded "ten thousand talents."5  Since the Pa
2 CONC rthians were established at Susa shortly after the death of Mithradates, that territory was probably added to the empire by him.6  At his death, the Parthian empire included Parthia proper, Hyrcania, 
2 CONC Media, Babylonia, Assyria, Elymais, Persis (?), and the districts of Tapuria and Traxiana. 
2 CONT <p>Scholars originally accepted Mithradates I died peacefully in 138/137 B.C., a date fixed by the date of his final tetradrachm (S13.5, dated 174 Seleucid era), and cuneiform evidence, but recent wor

2 CONT <p>Antiokos I Soter (gresk: ??t????? ?' S?t??, «Antiokos Befrieren»; født ukjent - død 261 f.Kr.) var den andre kongen av det hellenistiske Selevkideriket. Han styrte fra 281 f.Kr. ved sin fars d
2 CONC d og fram til 261 f.Kr.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Han var selv halvt persisk, hans mor Apama var en av de østlige prinsesser som Aleksander den store hadde gitt som hustruer til sine hærførere i 324 f.Kr.[1] I 294 f.Kr., før hans far Ptolemaio
2 CONC s I Soter var død, hadde Antiokos giftet sin stemor, Stratonike av Syria,[2] datter av Demetrios I Poliorketes. Hans aldrende far skal etter sigende ha tilskyndet ekteskapet etter at han oppdaget at 
2 CONC hans sønn var i fare for å forgå av forelskelse. Stratonike fødte ham fem barn: Seleukos (som ble henrettet for opprør), Laodike, Apama II, Stratonike av Makedonia og Antiokos II Theos som etterf
2 CONC ulgte sin far som konge.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Da hans far ble myrdet i 281 f.Kr. havnet store oppgaven med å holde Selevkideriket sammen på Antiokos. Et opprør i Syria brøt ut nesten umiddelbart. Antiokos var snart tvunget til å slutte fr
2 CONC ed med farens morder, Ptolemaios Keraunos, samtidig som han tydeligvis oppga Makedonia og Trakia. I Anatolia klarte han ikke å bekjempe Bitynia eller de persiske dynastiene som styrte i Kappadokia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I 278 f.Kr. brøt keltisktalende folk inn i Anatolia og slo seg ned i Galatia. En seier som Antiokos vant over disse ved å benytte indiske krigselefanter i 275 f.Kr. skal etter sigende være oppri
2 CONC nnelsen til hans tittel som Soter (gresk for «Befrier» eller «Frelser»). Mot slutten av det samme året førte spørsmålet om Koilesyria, som hadde vært åpent mellom selevkidedynastiet og ptole
2 CONC meerdynastiet i Egypt siden 301 f.Kr., til åpen fiendskap i form av den første syriske krig. Koilesyria hadde jevnlig vært okkupert av Egypt, men Selevkideriket hadde opprettholdt sitt krav på omr
2 CONC ådet. Krigen endret ikke grensene mellom de to rikene i større grad, men grensebyer som Damaskus og kystdistriktene i Anatolia skiftet eier.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Den 27. mars 268 f.Kr. la Antiokos grunnleggelsen for Ezidatempelet i Borsippa.[3] Hans eldste sønn Seleukos hadde styrt i øst som visekonge fra kanskje 275 f.Kr. og fram til 268/267 f.Kr. Han bl
2 CONC e nødt å henrette sønnen det sistnevnte året, anklaget for opprør. En gang rundt 262 f.Kr. forsøkte Antiokos å bryte den voksende makten til Pergamon med våpenmakt, men gikk på et nederlag ve
2 CONC d Sardis og døde kort tid etterpå. Han ble etterfulgt i 261 f.Kr. av hans andre sønn Antiokos II Theos.[4

2 CONT <p>In 278 BC the Gauls broke into Anatolia, and a victory that Antiochus won over these Gauls by using Indian war elephants (275 BC) is said to have been the origin of his title of Soter (Gr. for "sav

2 CONT <p>At the end of 275 BC the question of Coele-Syria, which had been open between the houses of Seleucus and Ptolemy since the partition of 301 BC, led to hostilities (the First Syrian War). It had bee

2 CONT <p>On March 27 268 BC Antiochus I laid the foundation for the Ezida Temple in Borsippa. His eldest son Seleucus had ruled in the east as viceroy from 275 BC(?) till 268/267 BC; Antiochus put his son t

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} '''Seleucus I''' (given the surname by later generations of Nicator, Greek : Σέλευκος Νικάτωρ, i.e. Seleucus the Victor) (ca. 358 BC – 281 BC) was a leading officer of
2 CONC  Alexander the Great's League of Corinth and one of the Diadochi. In the Wars of the Diadochi that took place after Alexander's death, Seleucus established the Seleucid dynasty and the Seleucid Empire
2 CONC . His kingdom would be one of the last holdouts of Alexander's former empire to Roman rule. They were only outlived by the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt by roughly 34 years.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Alexander, Seleucus was nominated as the satrap of Babylon in 320 BC. Antigonus forced Seleucus to flee from Babylon, but, supported by Ptolemy, he was able to return in 312 BC. 
2 CONC Seleucus' later conquests include Persia and Media. It is assumed that he was defeated by the emperor of India, Chandragupta Maurya and accepted a matrimony alliance for 500 elephants after ceding the
2 CONC  territories considered as part of India. Seleucus defeated Antigonus in the battle of Ipsus in 301 BC and Lysimachus in the battle of Corupedium in 281 BC. He was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus dur
2 CONC ing the same year. His successor was his son Antiochus I.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus founded a number of new cities, including Antioch and Seleucia.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus was the son of Antiochus from Orestis. Historian Junianus Justinus claims he was one of Philip II of Macedon's generals. Antiochus is not, however, mentioned in any other sources and nothi
2 CONC ng is known of his supposed career under Philip. It is possible that Antiochus was a member of an upper Macedonian noble family. Seleucus' mother was supposedly called Laodice, but nothing else is kno
2 CONC wn of her. Later, Seleucus named a number of cities after his parents.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As a teenager, Seleucus was chosen to serve as the king's page (paides). It was customary for all male offspring of noble families to first serve in this position and later as officers in the king'
2 CONC s army.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus' year of birth is unclear. Justin claims he was 77 years old during the battle of Corupedium, which would place his year of birth at 358 BC. Appianus tells us Seleucus was 73 years old dur
2 CONC ing the battle, which means 354 BC would be the year of birth. Eusebius of Caesarea, however, mentions the age of 75, and thus the year 356 BC, making Seleucus the same age as Alexander the Great. Thi
2 CONC s is most likely propaganda on Seleucus' part to make him seem comparable to Alexander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus was born in Europos, located in the northern part of Macedonia. Just a year before his birth (if the year 358 BC is accepted as the most likely date), the Paeonians invaded the region. Phi
2 CONC lip defeated the invaders and only a few years later utterly subdued them under Macedonian rule.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A number of legends, similar to those told of Alexander the Great, were told of Seleucus. It was said Antiochus told his son before he left to battle the Persians with Alexander that his real fathe
2 CONC r was actually the god Apollo. The god had left a ring with a picture of an anchor as a gift to Laodice. Seleucus had a birthmark shaped like an anchor. It was told that Seleucus' sons and grandsons a
2 CONC lso had similar birthmarks. The story is similar to the one told about Alexander. Most likely the story is merely propaganda by Seleucus, who presumably invented the story to present himself as the na
2 CONC tural successor of Alexander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>John Malalas tells us Seleucus had a sister called Didymeia, who had sons called Nicanor and Nicomedes. It is most likely the sons are fictitious. Didymeia might refer to the oracle of Apollo in Di
2 CONC dyma near Miletus. It has also been suggested that Ptolemy (son of Seleucus) was actually the uncle of Seleucus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>===Early career under Alexander the Great===</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In spring 334 BC, as a young man of about twenty-three, Seleucus accompanied Alexander into Asia. By the time of the Indian campaigns beginning in late in 327 BC, he had risen to the command of the
2 CONC  élite infantry corps in the Macedonian army, the "Shield-bearers" (Hypaspistai), later known as the "Silvershields". It is said that when Alexander crossed the Hydaspes river on a boat, he was accom
2 CONC panied by Perdiccas, Ptolemy I Soter, Lysimachus and also Seleucus. During the subsequent Battle of the Hydaspes River, Seleucus led his troops against the elephants of King Porus. It is likely that S
2 CONC eleucus had no role in the actual planning of the battle. He is also not mentioned as holding any major independent position during the battle, unlike, for example, Craterus, Hephaistion, Peithon and 
2 CONC Leonnatus – each of whom had sizable detachments under his control. Seleucus' Royal Hypaspistai were constantly under Alexander's eye and at his disposal. They later participated in the Indus valley
2 CONC  campaign, in the battles fought against the Malli and in the crossing of the Gedrosian desert.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus also took his future wife, the Persian princess Apama (daughter of Spitamenes), with him into India as his mistress, where she gave birth to his bastard[citation needed] eldest son and suc
2 CONC cessor Antiochus I Soter (325 BC). At the great marriage ceremony at Susa in the spring of 324 BC, Seleucus formally married Apama, and she later bore him at least two legitimate daughters, Laodice, A
2 CONC pama and a son Achaeus. At the same event, Alexander married the daughter of Darius III while several other Macedonians married Persian women. After Alexander's death, when the other senior Macedonian
2 CONC  officers unloaded their "Susa wives" en masse, Seleucus was one of the very few who kept his, and Apama remained his consort and later Queen for the rest of her life.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus is mentioned three times in ancient sources before the death of Alexander. He participated in a sailing trip near Babylon, took part in the dinner party of Medeios the Thessalian with Alex
2 CONC ander and visited the temple of Sarapis. In the first of these episodes, Alexander's diadem was blown off his head and landed on some reeds near the tombs of Assyrian kings. Seleucus swam to fetch the
2 CONC  diadem back, placing it on his own head while returning to the boat to keep it dry. The validity of the story is dubious. The story of the dinner party of Medeios may be true, but the plot to poison 
2 CONC the King is unlikely.In the final story, Seleucus reportedly slept in the temple of Sarapis in the hope that Alexander's health might improve. The validity of this story is also questionable.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>===Senior officer under Perdiccas===</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Alexander the Great died without a successor in Babylon on June 10, 323 BC. His general Perdiccas became the regent of all of Alexander's empire, while Alexander's physically and mentally disabled 
2 CONC half-brother Arrhidaeus was chosen as the next king under the name Philip III of Macedon. Alexander's unborn child (Alexander IV) was also named his father's successor. In the "Partition of Babylon" h
2 CONC owever, Perdiccas effectively divided the enormous Macedonian dominion among Alexander's generals. Seleucus was chosen to command the Companion cavalry (hetaroi) and appointed first or court chiliarch
2 CONC , which made him the senior officer in the Royal Army after the regent and commander-in-chief Perdiccas. Several other powerful men supported Perdiccas, including Ptolemy, Lysimachus, Peithon and Eume
2 CONC nes. Perdiccas' power depended on his ability to hold Alexander's enormous empire together, and on whether he could force the satraps to obey him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>War soon broke out between Perdiccas and the other Diadochi. To cement his position, Perdiccas tried to marry Alexander's sister Cleopatra. The First War of the Diadochi began when Perdiccas sent A
2 CONC lexander's corpse to Macedonia for burial. Ptolemy however captured the body and took it to Alexandria. Perdiccas and his troops followed him to Egypt, whereupon Ptolemy conspired with the satrap of M
2 CONC edia, Peithon, and the commander of the Argyraspides, Antigenes, both serving as officers under Perdiccas, and assassinated him. Cornelius Nepos mentions that Seleucus also took part in this conspirac
2 CONC y, but this is not certain.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>===Satrap of Babylon===</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The most powerful man in the empire after the death of Perdiccas was Antipater. Perdiccas' opponents gathered in Triparadisos, where the empire of Alexander was partitioned again (the Treaty of Tri
2 CONC paradisus 321 BC).</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At Triparadisos the soldiers had become mutinous and were planning to murder their master Antipater. Seleucus and Antigonus, however, managed to prevent this. For betraying Perdiccas, Seleucus was 
2 CONC awarded the rich province of Babylon. This decision may have been Antigonus' idea. Seleucus' Babylon was surrounded by Peucestas, the satrap of Persis; Antigenes, the new satrap of Susiana and Peithon
2 CONC  of Media. Babylon was one of the wealthiest provinces of the empire, but its military power was insignificant. It is possible that Antipater divided the eastern provinces so that no single satrap cou

2 CONT <p>After the death of Alexander, Archon of Pella was chosen satrap of Babylon. Perdiccas, however, had had plans to supersede Archon and nominate Docimus as his successor. During his invasion of Egypt
2 CONC , Perdiccas sent Docimus along with his detachments to Babylon. Archon waged war against him, but fell in battle. Thus, Docimus was not intending to give Babylon to Seleucus without a fight. It is not
2 CONC  certain how Seleucus took Babylon from Docimus, but according to one Babylonian chronicle an important building was destroyed in the city during the summer or winter of 320 BC. Other Babylonian sourc
2 CONC es state that Seleucus arrived in Babylon in October or November 320 BC. Despite the presumed battle, Docimus was able to escape.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Meanwhile, the empire was once again in turmoil. Peithon, the satrap of Media, assassinated Philip, the satrap of Parthia, and replaced him with his brother Eudemus as the new satrap. In the west A
2 CONC ntigonus and Eumenes waged war against each other. Just like Peithon and Seleucus, Eumenes was one of the former supporters of Perdiccas. Seleucus' biggest problem was, however, Babylon itself. The lo
2 CONC cals had rebelled against Archon and supported Docimus. The Babylonian priesthood had great influence over the region. Babylon also had a sizable population of Macedonian and Greek veterans of Alexand

2 CONC e en ekteskapsallianse for 500 elefanter etter å ha avstått områder som ble betraktet som en del av India. Selevkos beseiret Antigonos i slaget ved Ipsos i 301 f.Kr. og Lysimakhos, en annen av diad

2 CONT <p>Unge år og familie [rediger]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos var sønn av Antiokos.[1] Historikeren Junianus Justinus hevder at han var en av Filip II av Makedonias generaler, men Antiokos er imidlertid ikke nevnt noen annen kilde og det er ingentin
2 CONC g som er bevart om hans påståtte karriere under Filip. Det er mulig at Antiokos var et medlem av en høyere makedonske adelsfamilie. Selevkos' mor var etter signende kalt for Laodike, men ingenting 
2 CONC annet er kjent om henne. Senere kom Selevkos til å oppkalle en rekke byer etter sine foreldre. [2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Som tenåring ble Selevkos utvalgt til å tjene som kongens pasje (paides). Det var sedvane for alle mannlige avkom av adelsfamilier å først tjene i denne posisjonen og senere som offiserer i kon
2 CONC gens hær. [2]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hvilket år Selevkos ble født er uklart. Junianus hevder han var 77 år gammel i slaget ved Korupedion (281 f.Kr.), hvilket ville ha betydd at han ble født i 3578 f.Kr. Appian av Alexandria forte
2 CONC ller at han var 73 år under det samme slaget, hvilket betyr at han ble født i 354 f.Kr. Imidlertid sier Eusebius av Cæsarea at han var 75 år gammel, født i 356 f.Kr., hvilket betyr at Selevkos va
2 CONC r like gammel som Aleksander den store. Det er antagelig propaganda fra Selevkos' side for å gjøre seg selv likestilt med Aleksanders berømmelse. [3]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos ble født i Europos som er lokalisert i den nordlige delen av Makedonia. Kun et år før hans fødsel (om året 358 f.Kr. er akseptert som den mest sannsynlige datoen) invaderte paionerne 
2 CONC denne regionen. Filip beseiret angriperne og kun noen få år senere underkastet han dem fullstendig til makedonsk styre.[4]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Et antall legender, tilsvarende til de som ble fortalt om Aleksander den store, ble også fortalt om Selevkos. Det ble eksempelvis fortalt at hans far Antiokos hadde fortalt sin sønn før han dro 
2 CONC ut for å kjempe mot perserne at hans virkelig far var egentlig guden Apollon. Guden hadde etterlatt en ring med et bilde av et anker til hans mor Laodike. Selevkos hadde passende nok et fødemerke fo
2 CONC rmet som et anker. Det ble fortalt at hans sønn og sønnesønner hadde lignende fødemerker. Denne historien er lik den som ble fortalt om Aleksander. Igjen er dette mest sannsynlig propaganda som Se
2 CONC levkos fikk spredt om seg selv med den hensikt å presentere seg selv som den naturlige etterfølgeren av den store Aleksander. [2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Johannes Malalas, en gresk-bysantinsk kronikør fra Antiokia på 500-tallet, har fortalt at Selevkos hadde en søster ved navn Didymeia og som hadde sønner som ble kalt for Nikanor og Nikomedes. M
2 CONC est sannsynlig er disse sønnene fiktive. Didymeia kan derimot referere til Apollons orakel ved helligdommen Didyma i nærheten av Miletos. Det har også blitt foreslått at Ptolemaios (sønn av Selev
2 CONC kos), en av kongens livvakter, var i virkeligheten en onkel av ham. [5]

2 CONT <p>Tidlig karriere under Aleksander [rediger]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos ledet de kongelige hypaspistai under Aleksanders krig i Persia.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Våren 334 f.Kr. fulgte Selevkos, som en ung mann på rundt 23 år, Aleksander inn i Asia. Ved tidspunktet for krigstoktet inn i India sent i 327 f.Kr. hadde han fått ansvaret med å lede eliteinf
2 CONC anterikorpset i den makedonske hæren, hypaspistai, «skjoldbærerne», senere kjent som «sølvskjoldene». Det er sagt at da Aleksander krysset elven Hydaspes i en båt, ble han fulgt av Perdikkas, 
2 CONC Ptolemaios I Soter, Lysimakhos, foruten også Selevkos. I løpet av det påfølgende slaget ved Hydaspeselven, ledet Selevkos soldatene mot krigselefantene til kong Porus (Purushotthama). Det er sanns
2 CONC ynlig at Selevkos ikke hadde en aktiv rolle i dette slaget. Han er heller ikke nevnt å ha hatt noen betydelig selvstendig posisjon i løpet av slaget, i motsetningen til eksempelvis Krateros, Hefaist
2 CONC ion, Peithon, og Leonnatos, hver av dem hadde betydelig andel soldater under sin ledelse.[6] Selevkos' kongelige skjoldbærere var hele tiden i nærheten av Aleksander og til hans rådighet. De deltok
2 CONC  senere i den militære kampanjen i Indusdalen, i slagene som ble utkjempet mot det indiske folket malhierne og deltok også i kryssingen av ørkenen Gedrosia hvor Aleksander mistet minst en tredjedel
2 CONC  av sine menn.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos tok også hans framtidige hustru, den persiske prinsessen Apama (datter av Spitamenes), med seg til India som sin elskerinne. Der fødte hun hans eldste sønn og etterfølger Antiokos I So
2 CONC ter i 325 f.Kr. Ved den store bryllupsseremonien i Susa våren 324 f.Kr. giftet han seg formelt med Apama, og senere fødte hun ham minst to døtre, Laodike, Apama, og en sønn ved navn Akaios. I den 
2 CONC samme seremonien giftet Aleksander seg med datteren til Dareios III av Persia og flere andre makedonere giftet seg med persiske kvinner. Etter Aleksanders død, mens andre makedonske hærførere kvitt
2 CONC et seg med deres «Susa-koner», var Selevkos en av de meget få som beholdt sin, og Apama forble hans gemalinne og senere dronning for resten av hennes liv.[7]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos er nevnt tre ganger i antikke kilder før Aleksanders død. Han deltok på en seiltur i nærheten av Babylon, var tilstede i middagsselskap til Medeios fra Thessalia sammen med Aleksander,
2 CONC  og besøkte tempelet til den gresk-egyptiske guddommen Serapis. I den første av disse episodene blåste Aleksanders diadem av hans hode og landet på noen strå i nærhetene av gravene til de assyri
2 CONC ske kongene. Selevkos var den som svømte ut for å hendte den tilbake, og plasserte kronen på sitt eget hode mens vendte tilbake til båten for å holdet det tørt. Troverdigheten i denne fortelling
2 CONC en er tvilsom. Fortellingen om middagsselskapet kan derimot være sann, men sammensvergelsen om å forgifte kongen er ikke like troverdig og antagelig en foregripelse av Aleksanders senere død. I den
2 CONC  siste fortellingen skal Selevkos etter sigende ha sovet i tempelet til Sarapis i håp om at Aleksanders helse ville bedre seg. Heller ikke denne fortellingen er sannsynlig.[8]

2 CONT <p>Senioroffiser under Perdikkas [rediger]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ptolemaios I Soter, en av Aleksanders generaler, ble nominert som satrap av Egypt. Ptolemaios gjorde Egypt uavhengig og erklærte seg selv konge og farao.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Aleksander den store døde uten en etterfølger i Babylon den 10. juni 323 f.Kr. Hans general Perdikkas ble regent for hele hans store rike, mens Aleksanders noe tilbakestående halvbror Filip III 
2 CONC Arrhidaios ble valgt som den neste kongen av Makedonia. Aleksanders ufødte barn (Aleksander IV av Makedonia) ble også navngitt som sin fars etterfølger. I konferansen som kalles for delingen i Baby
2 CONC lon, fordelte Perdikkas de veldige besittelsene som utgjorde den avdøde kongens rike blant generalene. Selevkos ble valgt til kommandere elitekavaleriet (hetaroi) og utpekt til kiliark («hærfører 
2 CONC av et tusen»), noe som gjorde ham til senioroffiser for den kongelige hæren etter regenten og øverstkommanderende Perdikkas. Flere andre mektige menn støttet Perdikkas, inkludert Ptolemaios I Sote
2 CONC r, Lysimakhos, Peithon og Eumenes. Perdikkas' makt var avhengig av hans evne til å holde Aleksanders veldige rike, og om han kunne tvinge satrapene (guvernørene) til å adlyde ham. [8]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det brøt snart ut krig mellom Perdikkas og de andre diadokene. For å sikre sin posisjon, forsøkte Perdikkas å gifte seg med Aleksanders søster Kleopatra. Den første diadokkrigen begynte da Pe
2 CONC rdikkas sendte Aleksanders lik til Makedonia for gravleggelse. Ptolemaios røvet liket og tok det med til Alexandria i Egypt. Perdikkas og hans tropper fulgte ham til Egypt, hvorpå Ptolemaios sammens
2 CONC verget med Peithon, satrapen av Media, og Antigenes, kommandant av argyraspidene («sølvskjoldene»). Begge tjenestegjorde som offiserer under Perdikkas. De myrdet den aldrende kommandanten. Den sene
2 CONC re romerske biografen Cornelius Nepos nevner at Selevkos deltok i denne konspirasjonen, men det er ikke helt sikkert.[9]

2 CONT <p>Den mektigste mann i riket etter at Perdikkas var død var Antipatros. Perdikkas' motstandere samlet seg til et møte i Triparadisos (ved kildene til elven Orontes i dagens Libanon) hvor Aleksander
2 CONC s rike ble fordelt på nytt (avtalen i Triparadisos 321 f.Kr.). [10]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ved Triparadisos ble soldatene opprørske og la planer om slå sin herre Antipatros i hjel. Selevkos og Antigonos I Monofthalmos klarte imidlertid å forhindre dette. [11] For å forråde Perdikkas
2 CONC  ble Selevkos belønnet med den rike provinsen Babylon. Denne beslutningen kan ha vært Antigonos' forslag. Selevkos' Babylon var omgitt av Peukestas, satrapen av Persis; Antigenes, den nye satrap av 
2 CONC Susiana; og Peithon av Media. Babylon var en av de rikeste provinsene i riket, men dets militære makt var ubetydelig. Det er mulig at Antipatros delte opp de østlige provinsene i den hensikt at inge
2 CONC n enkeltstående satrap skulle kunne vokse seg sterkere enn noen av de andre. [10]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Etter Aleksanders død ble Arkon av Pella valgt til satrap av Babylon. Imidlertid hadde Perdikkas planer om å erstatte Arkon og nominere Antigonos Dokimos som hans etterfølger. I løpet av sin in
2 CONC vasjon av Egypt ble Dokimos sendt av Perdikkas til Babylon. Arkon gikk til krig mot ham, men falt i det påfølgende slaget. Således hadde Dokimos ikke til hensikt å overgi Babylon til Selevkos uten
2 CONC  kamp. Det er ikke klart hvordan Babylon ble tatt fra Dokimos, men i henhold til en babylonsk krønike ble en betydningsfull bygning i byen ødelagt i løpet av sommeren eller vinteren 320 f.Kr. Andre
2 CONC  babylonske kilder hevder at Selevkos kom til Babylon i enten oktober eller november 320 f.kr. Til tross for det antatte slaget, klarte Dokimos å flykte fra området.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>I mellomtiden hadde riket igjen havnet i uroligheter. Peithon, satrapen av Media, myrdet Filip, satrapen av Partia, og erstattet ham med sin egen bror Eudemos som ny satrap. I vest gikk Antigonos I
2 CONC  Monofthalmos og Eumenes av Kardia (Aleksanders sekretær) til krig mot hverandre. Akkurat som Peithon og Selevkos, var Eumenes en av de tidligere tilhengerne av Perdikkas. Selevkos' største problem 
2 CONC var imidlertid Babylon i seg selv. De lokale innbyggerne hadde gjort opprør mot Arkon og støttet Dokimos. Det babylonske presteskapet hadde stor innflytelse over regionen. Babylon hadde også en bet
2 CONC ydelig andel av befolkningen som besto av makedonske og greske veteraner fra Aleksanders hær. Selevkos greide å vinne over prestene med pengegaver og bestikkelser.[12]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Diakonenes andre krig [rediger]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos sendte to triremer og mindre krigsskip for å hindre Eumenes å krysse Tigris.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Etter at Antipatros var død i 319 f.Kr. fikk satrapen av Media ambisjoner om økt makt. Peithon samlet seg en stor hær på kanskje over 20 000 soldater. Under lederskapet til Peukestas samlet de 
2 CONC andre satrapene i regionen en egen, motstående hær. Peithon ble endelig beseiret i et slag som ble utkjempet i Partia. Han unnslapp til Media, men han ble ikke forfulgt av sine motstandere som isted
2 CONC en dro tilbake til Susiana. I mellomtiden hadde Eumenes og hans hær kommet til Kilikia, men måtte trekke seg tilbake da Antigonos I Monofthalmos nærmet seg. Situasjonen var vanskelig for Selevkos. 
2 CONC Eumenes og hans hær var nord for Babylon; Antigonos forfulgte ham med en enda større hær; Peithon var i Media og hans motstandere i Susiana. Antigenes, satrap av Susiana og kommandant av argyraspid
2 CONC ene, var alliert med Eumenes, men Antigenes var Kilikia da det brøt krig mellom ham og Peithon.[13]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Peithon kom fram til Babylon enten høsten eller vinteren 317 f.Kr. Han hadde mistet et stort antall av sine soldater, men Selevkos hadde uansett færre soldater. Eumenes besluttet å marsjere til 
2 CONC Susa våren 316 f.Kr. Satrapene i Susa hadde åpenbart akseptert Eumenes' utsagn at han kjempet på vegne av den lovlige herskerfamilie mot troneraneren Antigonos. Han marsjerte sine soldater 300 stad
2 CONC ioner fra Babylon og forsøkte å krysse Tigris. Det tvang Selevkos til å handle. Han sendte to triremer (krigsskip) og en del mindre skip for å hindre Eumenes å krysse elven. Han forsøkte også 
2 CONC  få den tidligere hypasiti av argyraspidene til slå seg sammen med ham, men det skjedde ikke. Selevkos sendte også beskjeder til Antigonos. På grunn av hans mangel på soldater hadde Selevkos åp
2 CONC enbart ingen planer om faktisk å stoppe Eumenes. Han åpnet flomsperrene til elven, men den resulterende flommen stoppet ham ikke.[14]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Våren 316 f.Kr. slo Selevkos og Peithon seg sammen med Antigonos som fulgte etter Eumenes til Susa. Fra Susa dro Antigonos til Media hvor han kunne true de østlige provinsene. Han etterlot Selevk
2 CONC os med et mindre antall tropper for å forhindre Eumenes fra å komme seg til Middelhavet. Sibyrtios, satrapen av Arakosia (et område i dagens sørlige Afghanistan), vurderte situasjonen som håpløs
2 CONC  og dro tilbake til sin egen provins. Hærene til Eumenes og hans allierte var ved et vendepunkt. Eumenes hadde to trefninger med Antigonos i 316 f.Kr. i slagene ved Paraitakene og Gabiene. Selv om be
2 CONC gge slagene ikke ble avgjørende i seg selv, var det argyraspidene som avgjorde fortsettelsen. De hadde fått høre at Antigonos hadde tatt deres hustruer og deres bytte fra alle årene med krigførin
2 CONC ger. De åpnet hemmelige forhandlinger med Antigonos, og ble enige om å utlevere Eumenes som øyeblikkelig ble henrettet. Hendelsene i den andre krigen til diakonene viste at Selevkos' hadde tålmodi
2 CONC ghet til vente til det rette øyeblikk. Å kaste seg hodestups inn i slag var ikke hans stil.[15]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Flukten til Egypt [rediger]</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonos tilbrakte vinteren i 316 f.Kr. i Media hvor stedets hersker igjen var Peithon. Sistnevntes begjær for makt hadde vokst, og han forsøkte å få en andel av Antigonos' til å gjøre oppr
2 CONC r til hans side. Antigonos oppdaget imidlertid sammensvergelsen og henrettet Peithon. Deretter erstattet han posisjonen som satrap av Persia med Peukestas.[16] Sommeren 315 f.Kr. kom Antigonos til Ba
2 CONC bylon og ble tatt varmt imot av Selevkos. Forholdet mellom de to ble derimot snart kaldt. Selevkos straffet en av Antigonos' offiserer uten først å be om tillatelse fra Antigonos. Antigonos ble rase
2 CONC nde og krevde at Selevkos skulle gi ham inntekten fra provinsen, noe Selevkos nektet å gjøre.[17] Selevkos kunne likevel ikke føle seg trygg for Antigonos, og for ikke å ta sjanser med sitt eget l
2 CONC iv, flyktet han til Egypt sammen med 50 ryttere. Det er sagt at astrologer fra Kaldea hadde gitt Antigonos spådommen at Selevkos en gang ville bli herre over hele Asia og bli hans banemann. Etter å 
2 CONC ha hørt dette, sendte den overtroiske Antigonos soldater etter Selevkos som derimot først unnslapp til Mesopotamia og deretter til Syria. Antigonos henrettet Blitor, den nye satrapen av Mesopotamia,
2 CONC  for å ha gitt hjelp til Selevkos. Moderne forskere er skeptiske til fortellingen om spådommen, og det synes som om presteskapet i Babylon var imot Selevkos.[18]

2 CONT <p>Samtidig som Selevkos rømte mot Egypt var det stor uro i Makedonia. Kassandros, sønn av Antipatros, myrdet Filip III Arrhidaios, Aleksander den stores halvbror, sammen med Filips hustru Eurydike,

2 CONT <p>Etter å ha kommet trygt fram til Egypt, sendte Selevkos sine venner til Hellas for å informere Kassandros og Lysimakhos, herskeren av Trakia, om Antigonos. Sistnevnte var nå blitt den mektigste 
2 CONC av diakonene, og de andre kom snart til å alliere seg imot ham. De allierte sendte et forslag til Antigonos hvor de krevde at Selevkos måtte få lov til å vende tilbake til Babylon. Antigonos nekte
2 CONC t og dro til Syria hvor han planla å angripe Ptolemaios våren 314 f.Kr.[20] Selevkos ble gjort til admiral under Ptolemaios. Deretter begynte han beleire byen Tyr i Fønikia,[21] Antigonos allierte 
2 CONC seg med Rhodos. Øya hadde en strategisk lokalisering og dens marine var i stand til å forhindre de allierte å samle sine styrker. På grunn av trusselen fra Kypros, ga Ptolemaios hundre skip til Se
2 CONC levkos og sendte ham nordover til Egeerhavet. Flåten var for liten til å erobre Rhodos, men den var stor nok til å tvinge Asandros, satrap av Karia, til å alliere seg med Ptolemaios. For å demons
2 CONC trere sin makt invaderte Selevkos byen Erythrai, den ene av de tolv joniske byene ved vestkysten av Anatolia.

2 CONT <p>En annen Ptolemaios, en nevø av Antigonos, angrep Asandros. Selevkos dro tilbake til Kypros hvor Ptolemaios I Soter hadde sendt sin bror Menelaos sammen med 10 000 leiesoldater og hundre krigsskip
2 CONC . Selevkos og Menelaos begynte å beleire bystaten Kition på sørkysten av Kypros (i dag Larnaka). Antigonos sendte det meste av sin flåte til Egeerhavet og sin hær til Anatolia. Det ga Ptolemaios 
2 CONC I Soter muligheten til å angripe Syria hvor han beseiret Demetrios I Poliorketes, Antigonos' sønn, i slaget ved Gaza i 312 f.Kr. Det er sannsynlig at Selevkos deltok i dette slaget. Peithon, sønn a
2 CONC v Agenor, som Antigonos hadde forfremmet til som den nye satrap av Babylon, falt i slaget. Peithons død gjorde det mulig for Selevkos å vende tilbake til Babylon.[22]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos hadde forberedt godt sin tilbakekomst til Babylon. Etter slaget ved Gaza trakk Demetrios I seg tilbake til Tripoli mens Ptolemaios I Soter avanserte hele vegen fram til Sidon. Ptolemaios I
2 CONC  ga Selevkos 800 infanterister og 200 kavalerister. Han lot også hans venner følge ham, kanskje de samme 50 som hadde rømt til Egypt sammen med ham. På vegen tilbake til Babylon rekrutterte han yt
2 CONC terligere soldater fra de greske koloniene langs vegen. Han hadde til sist rundt 3 000 soldater, en liten hær. I Babylon barrikaderte Pethons kommandant Difilos seg innenfor byens festning, men Selev
2 CONC kos erobret Babylon ganske raskt og festningen falt også. De av hans venner som ble holdt som fanger i Babylon ble løslatt.[23] Hans triumferende tilbakekomst til Babylon ble siden vurdert som selve
2 CONC  begynnelsen på Selevkideriket og det første året i dette rikets kronologi.

2 CONT <p>Kort tid etter at Selevkos kom tilbake, forsøkte Antigonos' tilhengere å gjenerobre Babylon. Nikanor var den nye satrap av Media og strategos for de østlige provinser. Hans hær besto av rundt 1
2 CONC 7 000 soldater. Evagoras, satrap for Asia, var hans allierte. Det var opplagt at Selevkos lille hær ikke kunne beseire dem i et slag. Selevkos skjulte sin hær i siv- og myrområdene som omga det ste
2 CONC det hvor Nikanor planla å krysse Tigris og angrep overraskende om natten. Evagoras falt i begynnelsen av slaget og Nikanor ble avsondret fra sine soldater. Da nyheten om at Evagoras var død spredte 
2 CONC seg blant soldatene, begynte de å overgi i mengder. De fleste av dem overga sin lojalitet til Selevkos. Nikanor rakk så vidt å unnslippe med noen få menn. [24]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selv om Selevkos nå hadde en hær som utgjorde rundt 20 000 menn var de fortsatt ikke nok til å stå imot styrkene til Antigonos. Han visste heller ikke når Antigonos ville gjøre sitt motangrep
2 CONC . På den annen siden viste han minst to østlige provinser ikke hadde en satrap. Flertallet av hans soldater kom fra disse områdene. En del av Evagoras' soldater var persere, og en del av dem hadde 
2 CONC en grunn til å mislike Antigonos. Selevkos besluttet å dra fordel av dette. [24]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Selevkos fikk spedt ulike fortellinger i provinsene og blant soldatene. I henhold til en av dem hadde han i en drøm sett Aleksander den store stå ved siden ham. Eumenes hadde tidligere forsøkt d
2 CONC en tilsvarende propagandaen. Antigonos, som hadde vært i Anatolia mens Selevkos hadde vært i øst med Aleksander, kunne ikke bruke Aleksander i sin egen propaganda. Selevkos som var makedoner, hadde
2 CONC  muligheten til få makedonernes tillit blant sine soldater, noe som ikke var tilfellet med Eumenes.[25]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Etter atter igjen å ha blitt satrap av Babylon, ble Selevkos stadig mer aggressiv i sin politikk. På kort tid erobret han Media og Susiana. Historikeren Diodorus Siculus rapporterte at Selevkos e
2 CONC robret andre områder i nærheten, hvilket kan være Persis, Aria (ved Hari Rud) eller Partia. Han nådde derimot ikke fram til Baktria og Sogdia (tilsvarende dagens Usbekistan). Satrapen av Baktria v
2 CONC ar Stasanor som hadde klart å holde seg nøytral i de tidligere konfliktene. Etter at Nikanor hadde lidd nederlag var det ingen hær i øst som kunne stå imot Selevkos. Det er uklart hvordan Selevko
2 CONC s klarte å administrere de provinsene han erobret. De fleste satraper var døde. I teorien var Polyperkon fortsatte den lovmessige forgjengeren til Antipatros og den offisielle regent av det makedons
2 CONC ke kongerike. Det var hans plikt og rett til å utnevne satraper. Imidlertid var Polyperkon fortsatt alliert med Antipatros og dermed en fiende av Selevkos.[26]

2 CONT <p>Antigonos sendte sin sønn Demetrios I Poliorketes med 15 000 infanterister og 4 000 kavalerister for å gjenerobre Babylon. Tilsynelatende ga han Demetrios en tidsbegrensning, og etter denne mått
2 CONC e han vendte tilbake til Syria. Antigonos synes å tro at Selevkos kun styrte Babylon, hvilket kan innebære at Nikanor ikke hadde informert om det antallet soldater som hadde byttet side. Det synes s
2 CONC om om rekkevidden av Nikanors nederlag ikke var kjent av alle og heller ikke de erobringer som Selevkos hadde gjort i øst.[27]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Da Demetrios kom fram til Babylon var Selevkos fortsatt et sted i øst. Han hadde etterlatt Patrokles til å forsvare byen. Babylon ble beseiret på en uvanlig måte. Den hadde to sterke festninger
2 CONC  som Selevkos hadde etterlatt sine garnisoner. Innbyggerne ble transportert ut og bosatt naboområdene, en del så langt unna som Susa. Byens omgivelser var godt egnet for forsvar, bestående av byer,
2 CONC  sumper, kanaler og elver. Demetrios' soldater begynte med å beleire Babylons festninger og greide å erobre en av dem. Den andre viste seg langt mer vanskelig. Han etterlot sin venn Arkelaos til å 
2 CONC fortsette beleiringen med 5 000 infanterister og 1 000 kavalerister mens han selv forlot området. De antikke kildene nevner ikke hva som skjedde med disse styrkene, men kanskje de ble nedkjempet av S

2 CONT <p>I 311 f.Kr. inngikk Antigonos fred med Kassandros, Lysimakhos og Ptolemaios I Soter, og det ga ham endelig pusterom til å ta seg av Selevkos.[29] Antigonos' hær besto av minst 80 000 soldater. Se

2 CONC on var Selevkos' hær åpenbart langt større enn tidligere. [30]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det er lite informasjon som er bevart om konflikten mellom Antigonos og Selevkos; kun en meget rudimentær babylonisk krønike har gitt noen få detaljer om krigen. Beskrivelsen for året 310 f.Kr.
2 CONC  er helt gått tapt. Det synes som om Antigonos greide å erobre Babylon, men hans planer ble forstyrret da Ptolemaios I Soter overraskende angrep Kilikia.[30]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Det er kjent at Selevkos greide å beseire Antigonos i minst ett avgjørende slag. Dette slaget er kun nevnt i Polyainos' verk Strategemata (Om strategier). Polyainos forteller at soldatene til Sel
2 CONC evkos og Antigonos kjempet en hel dag, men da natten kom var slaget fortsatt ikke avgjort. De to styrkene ble enige om å hvile for natten og fortsette neste dag. Antigonos' soldater sov uten deres ut

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Uansett detaljer endte den babylonske krigen med at Selevkos seiret. Antigonos ble tvunget til trekke seg tilbake vestover. Begge sider befestet sine grenser. Antigonos bygde en rekke festninger la

2 CONT <p>Den neste hendelsen knyttet til Selevkos var grunnleggelsen av byen Seleukia. Byen ble bygget ved bredden av Tigris antagelig i 397 eller 305 f.Kr. Selevkos gjorde Seleukia til sin nye hovedstad, s

2 CONT <p>En fortelling om byens grunnleggelse er som følgende: Selevkos spurte de babylonske prestene om hvilken dag som var best for å opprette en by. Prestene kalkulerte dagen, men ønsket at grunnlegge

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus I Nicator (c. 358 BC – 281 BC) (Ancient Greek: Σέλευκος Α΄ Νικάτωρ) was one of the Diadochi. Having previously served as an infantry general under Alexander the Great, h
2 CONC e eventually assumed the title of basileus and established the Seleucid Empire over much of the territory in the Near East which Alexander had conquered.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Alexander in June 323 BC, Seleucus initially supported Perdiccas, the regent of Alexander's empire, and was appointed Commander of the Companions and chiliarch at the Partition o
2 CONC f Babylon in 323 BC. However, after the outbreak of the Wars of the Diadochi in 322, Perdiccas' military failures against Ptolemy in Egypt led to the mutiny of his troops in Pelusium. Perdiccas was be
2 CONC trayed and assassinated in a conspiracy by Seleucus, Peithon and Antigenes in Pelusium sometime in either 321 or 320 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the Partition of Triparadisus in 321 BC, Seleucus was appointed Satrap of Babylon under the new regent Antipater. But almost immediately, the wars between the Diadochi resumed and Antigonus forc
2 CONC ed Seleucus to flee Babylon. Seleucus was only able to return to Babylon in 312 BC with the support of Ptolemy. From 312 BC, Seleucus ruthlessly expanded his dominions and eventually conquered the Per
2 CONC sian and Median lands. Seleucus ruled not only Babylonia, but the entire enormous eastern part of Alexander's empire:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''"Always lying in wait for the neighboring nations, strong in arms and persuasive in council, he [Seleucus] acquired Mesopotamia, Armenia, 'Seleucid' Cappadocia, Persis, Parthia, Bactria, Arabia, 
2 CONC Tapouria, Sogdia, Arachosia, Hyrcania, and other adjacent peoples that had been subdued by Alexander, as far as the river Indus, so that the boundaries of his empire were the most extensive in Asia af
2 CONC ter that of Alexander. The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus." — Appian, The Syrian Wars''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus' wars took him as far as India, where, after two years of war (305-303 BC), he made peace with the Indian Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, and exchanged his eastern satrapies in the Indus Rive
2 CONC r Valley for a considerable force of 500 war elephants, which would play a decisive role against Antigonus at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC and against Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BC
2 CONC .
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''"The Indians occupy [in part] some of the countries situated along the Indus, which formerly belonged to the Persians: Alexander deprived the Ariani of them, and established there settlements of 
2 CONC his own. But Seleucus Nicator gave them to Sandrocottus in consequence of a marriage contract, and received in return five hundred elephants." — Strabo, Geographica''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus' victories against Antigonus and Lysimachus left the Seleucid dynasty virtually unopposed in Asia and in Anatolia. However, Seleucus also hoped to take control of Lysimachus' European terr
2 CONC itories, primarily Thrace and Macedon itself. But upon arriving in Thrace in 281 BC, Seleucus was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus, who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court with his sister Lysandra.
2 CONC  The assassination of Seleucus destroyed Seleucid prospects in Thrace and Macedon, and paved the way for Ptolemy Ceraunus to absorb much of Lysimachus' former power in Macedon. Seleucus was succeeded 
2 CONC by his son Antiochus I as ruler of the Seleucid empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus founded a number of new cities during his reign, including Antioch (300 BC) and in particular Seleucia on the Tigris (ca. 305 BC), the new capital of the Seleucid Empire, a foundation that
2 CONC  eventually depopulated Babylon.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Youth and family'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus was the son of Antiochus. Historian Junianus Justinus claims that Antiochus was one of Philip II of Macedon's generals, but no such general is mentioned in any other sources, and nothing i
2 CONC s known of his supposed career under Philip. It is possible that Antiochus was a member of an upper Macedonian noble family. Seleucus' mother was supposedly called Laodice, but nothing else is known o
2 CONC f her. Later, Seleucus named a number of cities after his parents. Seleucus was born in Europos, located in the northern part of Macedonia. Just a year before his birth (if the year 358 BC is accepted
2 CONC  as the most likely date), the Paeonians invaded the region. Philip defeated the invaders and only a few years later utterly subdued them under Macedonian rule. Seleucus' year of birth is unclear. Jus
2 CONC tin claims he was 77 years old during the battle of Corupedium, which would place his year of birth at 358 BC. Appianus tells us Seleucus was 73 years old during the battle, which means 354 BC would b
2 CONC e the year of birth. Eusebius of Caesarea, however, mentions the age of 75, and thus the year 356 BC, making Seleucus the same age as Alexander the Great. This is most likely propaganda on Seleucus' p
2 CONC art to make him seem comparable to Alexander.

2 CONT <p>As a teenager, Seleucus was chosen to serve as the king's page (paides). It was customary for all male offspring of noble families to first serve in this position and later as officers in the king'
2 CONC s army.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>A number of legends, similar to those told of Alexander the Great, were told of Seleucus. It was said Antiochus told his son before he left to battle the Persians with Alexander that his real fathe
2 CONC r was actually the god Apollo. The god had left a ring with a picture of an anchor as a gift to Laodice. Seleucus had a birthmark shaped like an anchor. It was told that Seleucus' sons and grandsons a
2 CONC lso had similar birthmarks. The story is similar to the one told about Alexander. Most likely the story is merely propaganda by Seleucus, who presumably invented the story to present himself as the na
2 CONC tural successor of Alexander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>John Malalas tells us Seleucus had a sister called Didymeia, who had sons called Nicanor and Nicomedes. It is most likely the sons are fictitious. Didymeia might refer to the oracle of Apollo in Di
2 CONC dyma near Miletus. It has also been suggested that Ptolemy (son of Seleucus) was actually the uncle of Seleucus.

2 CONT <p>'''Early career under Alexander the Great'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In spring 334 BC, as a young man of about twenty-three, Seleucus accompanied Alexander into Asia. By the time of the Indian campaigns beginning in late in 327 BC, he had risen to the command of the
2 CONC  élite infantry corps in the Macedonian army, the "Shield-bearers" (Hypaspistai, later known as the "Silvershields"). It is said that when Alexander crossed the Hydaspes river on a boat, he was accom
2 CONC panied by Perdiccas, Ptolemy I Soter, Lysimachus and also Seleucus. During the subsequent Battle of the Hydaspes (326 BCE), Seleucus led his troops against the elephants of King Porus. It is likely th
2 CONC at Seleucus had no role in the actual planning of the battle. He is also not mentioned as holding any major independent position during the battle, unlike, for example, Craterus, Hephaistion, Peithon 
2 CONC and Leonnatus – each of whom had sizable detachments under his control. Seleucus' Royal Hypaspistai were constantly under Alexander's eye and at his disposal. They later participated in the Indus Va
2 CONC lley campaign, in the battles fought against the Malli and in the crossing of the Gedrosian desert.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus took his future wife, the Persian princess Apama (daughter of Spitamenes), with him as his mistress into India, where she gave birth to his eldest son and successor Antiochus I Soter (325 
2 CONC BC). At the great marriage ceremony at Susa in the spring of 324 BC, Seleucus formally married Apama, and she later bore him at least two legitimate daughters (Laodice and Apama) and a son (Achaeus). 
2 CONC At the same event, Alexander married the daughter of the late Persian King Darius III while several other Macedonians married Persian women. After Alexander's death (323 BCE), when the other senior Ma
2 CONC cedonian officers unloaded their "Susa wives" en masse, Seleucus was one of the very few who kept his, and Apama remained his consort (later Queen) for the rest of her life.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Ancient sources mention Seleucus three times before the death of Alexander. He participated in a sailing trip near Babylon, took part in the dinner party of Medeios the Thessalian with Alexander an
2 CONC d visited the temple of the god Sarapis.[citation needed] In the first of these episodes, Alexander's diadem was blown off his head and landed on some reeds near the tombs of Assyrian kings. Seleucus 
2 CONC swam to fetch the diadem back, placing it on his own head while returning to the boat to keep it dry. The validity of the story is dubious. The story of the dinner party of Medeios may be true, but th
2 CONC e plot to poison the King is unlikely. In the final story, Seleucus reportedly slept in the temple of Sarapis in the hope that Alexander's health might improve. The validity of this story is also ques
2 CONC tionable, as the Graeco-Egyptian Sarapis had not been invented at the time.

2 CONT <p>'''Senior officer under Perdiccas'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Alexander the Great died without a successor in Babylon on June 10, 323 BC. His general Perdiccas became the regent of all of Alexander's empire, while Alexander's physically and mentally disabled 
2 CONC half-brother Arrhidaeus was chosen as the next king under the name Philip III of Macedon. Alexander's unborn child (Alexander IV) was also named his father's successor. In the "Partition of Babylon" h
2 CONC owever, Perdiccas effectively divided the enormous Macedonian dominion among Alexander's generals. Seleucus was chosen to command the Companion cavalry (hetairoi) and appointed first or court chiliarc
2 CONC h, which made him the senior officer in the Royal Army after the regent and commander-in-chief Perdiccas. Several other powerful men supported Perdiccas, including Ptolemy, Lysimachus, Peithon and Eum
2 CONC enes. Perdiccas' power depended on his ability to hold Alexander's enormous empire together, and on whether he could force the satraps to obey him.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>War soon broke out between Perdiccas and the other Diadochi. To cement his position, Perdiccas tried to marry Alexander's sister Cleopatra. The First War of the Diadochi began when Perdiccas sent A
2 CONC lexander's corpse to Macedonia for burial. Ptolemy however captured the body and took it to Alexandria. Perdiccas and his troops followed him to Egypt, whereupon Ptolemy conspired with the satrap of M
2 CONC edia, Peithon, and the commander of the Argyraspides, Antigenes, both serving as officers under Perdiccas, and assassinated him. Cornelius Nepos mentions that Seleucus also took part in this conspirac
2 CONC y, but this is not certain.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Satrap of Babylon'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The most powerful man in the empire after the death of Perdiccas was Antipater. Perdiccas' opponents gathered in Triparadisos, where the empire of Alexander was partitioned again (the Treaty of Tri
2 CONC paradisus 321 BC).</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At Triparadisos the soldiers had become mutinous and were planning to murder their master Antipater. Seleucus and Antigonus, however, managed to prevent this. For betraying Perdiccas, Seleucus was 
2 CONC awarded the rich province of Babylon. This decision may have been Antigonus' idea. Seleucus' Babylon was surrounded by Peucestas, the satrap of Persis; Antigenes, the new satrap of Susiana and Peithon
2 CONC  of Media. Babylon was one of the wealthiest provinces of the empire, but its military power was insignificant. It is possible that Antipater divided the eastern provinces so that no single satrap cou
2 CONC ld rise above the others in power.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Alexander, Archon of Pella was chosen satrap of Babylon. Perdiccas, however, had had plans to supersede Archon and nominate Docimus as his successor. During his invasion of Egypt
2 CONC , Perdiccas sent Docimus along with his detachments to Babylon. Archon waged war against him, but fell in battle. Thus, Docimus was not intending to give Babylon to Seleucus without a fight. It is not
2 CONC  certain how Seleucus took Babylon from Docimus, but according to one Babylonian chronicle an important building was destroyed in the city during the summer or winter of 320 BC. Other Babylonian sourc
2 CONC es state that Seleucus arrived in Babylon in October or November 320 BC. Despite the presumed battle, Docimus was able to escape.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Meanwhile, the empire was once again in turmoil. Peithon, the satrap of Media, assassinated Philip, the satrap of Parthia, and replaced him with his brother Eudemus as the new satrap. In the west A
2 CONC ntigonus and Eumenes waged war against each other. Just like Peithon and Seleucus, Eumenes was one of the former supporters of Perdiccas. Seleucus' biggest problem was, however, Babylon itself. The lo
2 CONC cals had rebelled against Archon and supported Docimus. The Babylonian priesthood had great influence over the region. Babylon also had a sizable population of Macedonian and Greek veterans of Alexand
2 CONC er's army. Seleucus managed to win over the priests with monetary gifts and bribes.

2 CONT <p>''Second War of the Diadochi''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the death of Antipater in 319 BC, the satrap of Media began to expand his power. Peithon assembled a large army of perhaps over 20,000 soldiers. Under the leadership of Peucestas the other sa
2 CONC traps of the region brought together an opposing army of their own. Peithon was finally defeated in a battle waged in Parthia. He escaped to Media, but his opponents did not follow him and rather retu
2 CONC rned to Susiana. Meanwhile, Eumenes and his army had arrived at Cilicia, but had to retreat when Antigonus reached the city. The situation was difficult for Seleucus. Eumenes and his army were north o
2 CONC f Babylon; Antigonus was following him with an even larger army; Peithon was in Media and his opponents in Susiana. Antigenes, satrap of Susiana and commander of the Argyraspides, was allied with Eume
2 CONC nes. Antigenes was in Cilicia when the war between him and Peithon began.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Peithon arrived at Babylon in the autumn or winter of 317 BC. Peithon had lost a large number of troops, but Seleucus had even fewer soldiers. Eumenes decided to march to Susa in the spring of 316 
2 CONC BC. The satraps in Susa had apparently accepted Eumenes' claims of his fighting on behalf of the lawful ruling family against the usurper Antigonus. Eumenes marched his army 300 stadions away from Bab
2 CONC ylon and tried to cross the Tigris. Seleucus had to act. He sent two triremes and some smaller ships to stop the crossing. He also tried to get the former hypasiti of the Argyraspides to join him, but
2 CONC  this did not happen. Seleucus also sent messages to Antigonus. Because of his lack of troops, Seleucus apparently had no plans to actually stop Eumenes. He opened the flood barriers of the river, but
2 CONC  the resulting flood did not stop Eumenes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the spring of 316 BC, Seleucus and Peithon joined Antigonus, who was following Eumenes to Susa. From Susa Antigonus went to Media, from where he could threaten the eastern provinces. He left Sel
2 CONC eucus with a small number of troops to prevent Eumenes from reaching the Mediterranean. Sibyrtius, satrap of Arachosia, saw the situation as hopeless and returned to his own province. The armies of Eu
2 CONC menes and his allies were at breaking point. Antigonus and Eumenes had two encounters during 316 BC, in the battles of Paraitacene and Gabiene. Eumenes was defeated and executed. The events of the Sec
2 CONC ond War of the Diadochi revealed Seleucus' ability to wait for the right moment. Blazing into battle was not his style.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Escape to Egypt''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus spent the winter of 316 BC in Media, whose ruler was once again Peithon. Peithon's lust for power had grown, and he tried to get a portion of Antigonus troops to revolt to his side. Antig
2 CONC onus, however, discovered the plot and executed Peithon. He then superseded Peucestas as satrap of Persia. In the summer of 315 BC Antigonus arrived in Babylon and was warmly welcomed by Seleucus. The
2 CONC  relationship between the two soon turned cold, however. Seleucus punished one of Antigonus' officers without asking permission from Antigonus. Antigonus became angry and demanded that Seleucus give h
2 CONC im the income from the province, which Seleucus refused to do. He was, however, afraid of Antigonus and fled to Egypt with 50 horsemen. It is told that Chaldean astrologers prophesied to Antigonus tha
2 CONC t Seleucus would become master of Asia and would kill Antigonus. After hearing this, Antigonus sent soldiers after Seleucus, who had however first escaped to Mesopotamia and then to Syria. Antigonus e
2 CONC xecuted Blitor, the new satrap of Mesopotamia, for helping Seleucus. Modern scholars are skeptical of the prophecy story. It seems certain, however, that the Babylon priesthood was against Seleucus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>During Seleucus' escape to Egypt, Macedonia was undergoing great turmoil. Alexander the Great's mother Olympias had been invited back to Macedon by Polyperchon in order to drive Cassander out. She 
2 CONC held great respect among the Macedonian army but lost some of this when she had Philip III and his wife Eurydice killed as well as many nobles whom she took revenge upon for supporting Antipater durin
2 CONC g his long reign. Cassander reclaimed Macedon the following year at Pydna and then had her killed. Alexander IV, still a young child, and his mother Roxane were held guarded at Amphipolis and died und
2 CONC er mysterious circumstances in 310 BC, probably murdered at the instigation of Cassander to allow the diadochs to assume the title of kingship.

2 CONT <p>'''Admiral under Ptolemy'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After arriving in Egypt, Seleucus sent his friends to Greece to inform Cassander and Lysimachus, the ruler of Thracia, about Antigonus. Antigonus was now the most powerful of the Diadochi, and the 
2 CONC others would soon ally against him. The allies sent a proposition to Antigonus in which they demanded that Seleucus be allowed to return to Babylon. Antigonus refused and went to Syria, where he plann
2 CONC ed to attack Ptolemy in the spring of 314 BC. Seleucus was an admiral under Ptolemy. At the same time he started the siege of Tyros, Antigonus allied with Rhodes. The island had a strategic location a
2 CONC nd its navy was capable of preventing the allies from combining their forces. Because of the threat of Rhodes, Ptolemy gave Seleucus a hundred ships and sent him to the Aegean Sea. The fleet was too s
2 CONC mall to defeat Rhodes, but it was big enough to force Asander, the satrap of Caria, to ally with Ptolemy. To demonstrate his power, Seleucus also invaded the city of Erythrai. Ptolemy, nephew of Antig
2 CONC onus, attacked Asander. Seleucus returned to Cyprus, where Ptolemy I had sent his brother Menelaos along with 10,000 mercenaries and 100 ships. Seleucus and Menelaos began to besiege Kition. Antigonus
2 CONC  sent most of his fleet to the Aegean Sea and his army to Asia Minor. Ptolemy now had an opportunity to invade Syria, where he defeated Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, in the battle of Gaza in 312 BC
2 CONC . It is probable that Seleucus took part in the battle. Peithon, son of Agenor, whom Antigonus had nominated as the new satrap of Babylon, fell in the battle. The death of Peithon gave Seleucus an opp
2 CONC ortunity to return to Babylon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus had prepared his return to Babylon well. After the battle of Gaza Demetrius retreated to Tripoli while Ptolemy advanced all the way to Sidon. Ptolemy gave Seleucus 800 infantry and 200 cav
2 CONC alry. He also had his friends accompanying him, perhaps the same 50 who escaped with him from Babylon. On the way to Babylon Seleucus recruited more soldiers from the colonies along the route. He fina
2 CONC lly had about 3,000 soldiers. In Babylon, Pethon's commander, Diphilus, barricaded himself in the city's fortress. Seleucus conquered Babylon with great speed and the fortress was also quickly capture
2 CONC d. Seleucus' friends who had stayed in Babylon were released from captivity. His return to Babylon was afterwards officially regarded as the beginning of the Seleucid Empire and that year as the first
2 CONC  of the Seleucid era.

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Conquest of the eastern provinces''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Soon after Seleucus' return, the supporters of Antigonus tried to get Babylon back. Nicanor was the new satrap of Media and the strategos of the eastern provinces. His army had about 17,000 soldier
2 CONC s. Evagoras, the satrap of Aria, was allied with him. It was obvious that Seleucus' small force could not defeat the two in battle. Seleucus hid his armies in the marshes that surrounded the area wher
2 CONC e Nicanor was planning to cross the Tigris and made a surprise attack during the night. Evagoras fell in the beginning of the battle and Nicanor was cut off from his forces. The news about the death o
2 CONC f Evagoras spread among the soldiers, who started to surrender en masse. Almost all of them agreed to fight under Seleucus. Nicanor managed to escape with only a few men.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Even though Seleucus now had about 20,000 soldiers, they were not enough to withstand the forces of Antigonus. He also did not know when Antigonus would begin his counterattack. On the other hand, 
2 CONC he knew that at least two eastern provinces did not have a satrap. A great majority of his own troops were from these provinces. Some of Evagoras' troops were Persian. Perhaps a portion of the troops 
2 CONC were Eumenes' soldiers, who had a reason to hate Antigonus. Seleucus decided to take advantage of this situation.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus spread different stories among the provinces and the soldiers. According to one of them, he had in a dream seen Alexander standing beside him. Eumenes had tried to use a similar propaganda
2 CONC  trick. Antigonus, who had been in Asia Minor while Seleucus had been in the east with Alexander, could not use Alexander in his own propaganda. Seleucus, being Macedonian, had the ability to gain the
2 CONC  trust of the Macedonians among his troops, which was not the case with Eumenes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After becoming once again satrap of Babylon, Seleucus became much more aggressive in his politics. In a short time he conquered Media and Susiana. Diodorus Siculus reports that Seleucus also conque
2 CONC red other nearby areas, which might refer to Persis, Aria or Parthia. Seleucus did not reach Bactria and Sogdiana. The satrap of the former was Stasanor, who had managed to remain neutral during the c
2 CONC onflicts. After the defeat of Nikanor's army, there was no force in the east that could have opposed Seleucus. It is uncertain how Seleucus arranged the administration of the provinces he had conquere
2 CONC d. Most satraps had died. In theory, Polyperchon was still the lawful successor of Antipater and the official regent of the Macedonian kingdom. It was his duty to select the satraps. However, Polyperc
2 CONC hon was still allied with Antigonus and thus an enemy of Seleucus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Response''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus sent his son Demetrius along with 15,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry to reconquer Babylon. Apparently, he gave Demetrius a time limit, after which he had to return to Syria. Antigonus beli
2 CONC eved Seleucus was still ruling only Babylon. Perhaps Nicanor had not told him that Selucus now had at least 20,000 soldiers. It seems that the scale of Nicanor's defeat was not clear to all parties. A
2 CONC ntigonus did not know Seleucus had conquered the majority of the eastern provinces and perhaps cared little about the eastern parts of the empire.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Demetrius arrived in Babylon, Seleucus was somewhere in the east. He had left Patrocles to defend the city. Babylon was defended in an unusual way. It had two strong fortresses, in which Seleu
2 CONC cus had left his garrisons. The inhabitants of the city were transferred out and settled in the neighboring areas, some as far as Susa. The surroundings of Babylon were excellent for defense, with cit
2 CONC ies, swamps, canals and rivers. Demetrius' troops started to besiege the fortresses of Babylon and managed to conquer one of them. The second fortress proved more difficult for Demetrius. He left his 
2 CONC friend Archelaus to continue the siege, and himself returned west leaving 5,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry in Babylon. Ancient sources do not mention what happened to these troops. Perhaps Seleucus ha

2 CONT <p>''Babylonian War''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Over the course of nine years (311–302 BC), while Antigonus was occupied in the west, Seleucus brought the whole eastern part of Alexander's empire as far as the Jaxartes and Indus Rivers under h

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 311 BC Antigonus made peace with Cassander, Lysimachus and Ptolemy, which gave him an opportunity to deal with Seleucus. Antigonus' army had at least 80,000 soldiers. Even if he left half of his
2 CONC  troops in the west, he would still have a numerical advantage over Seleucus. Seleucus may have received help from Cossaians, whose ancestors were the ancient Kassites. Antigonus had devastated their 
2 CONC lands while fighting Eumenes. Seleucus perhaps recruited a portion of Archelaus' troops. When Antigonus finally invaded Babylon, Seleucus' army was much bigger than before. Many of his soldiers certai
2 CONC nly hated Antigonus. The population of Babylon was also hostile. Seleucus, thus, did not need to garrison the area to keep the locals from revolting.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Little information is available about the conflict between Antigonus and Seleucus; only a very rudimentary Babylonian chronicle detailing the events of the war remains. The description of the year 
2 CONC 310 BC has completely disappeared. It seems that Antigonus managed to conquer Babylon. His plans were disturbed, however, by Ptolemy, who made a surprise attack in Cilicia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>We do know that Seleucus managed to defeat Antigonus in at least one decisive battle. This battle is only mentioned in Stratagems in War by Polyaenus. Polyaenus reports that the troops of Seleucus 
2 CONC and Antigonus fought for a whole day, but when night came the battle was still undecided. The two forces agreed to rest for the night and continue in the morning. Antigonus' troops slept without their
2 CONC  equipment. Seleucus ordered his forces to sleep and eat breakfast in battle formation. Shortly before dawn, Seleucus' troops attacked the forces of Antigonus, who were still without their weapons and
2 CONC  in disarray and thus easily defeated. The historical accuracy of the story is questionable.

2 CONT <p>The Babylonian war finally ended in Seleucus' victory. Antigonus was forced to retreat west. Both sides fortified their borders. Antigonus built a series of fortresses along the Balikh River while

2 CONT <p>The next event connected to Seleucus was the founding of the city of Seleucia. The city was built on the shore of the Tigris probably in 307 or 305 BC. Seleucus made Seleucia his new capital, thus

2 CONT <p>''Chandragupta and the eastern provinces''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus soon turned his attention once again eastward. In the year 305 BC, Seleucus I Nicator went to India and apparently occupied territory as far as the Indus, and eventually waged war with the
2 CONC  Maurya Emperor Chandragupta Maurya:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Always lying in wait for the neighboring nations, strong in arms and persuasive in council, he [Seleucus] acquired Mesopotamia, Armenia, 'Seleucid' Cappadocia, Persis, Parthia, Bactria, Arabia, T
2 CONC apouria, Sogdia, Arachosia, Hyrcania, and other adjacent peoples that had been subdued by Alexander, as far as the river Indus, so that the boundaries of his empire were the most extensive in Asia aft
2 CONC er that of Alexander. The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus. He crossed the Indus and waged war with Sandrocottus, king of the Indians, who dwelt on the banks of that stre
2 CONC am, until they came to an understanding with each other and contracted a marriage relationship. – Appian, History of Rome, The Syrian Wars 55''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Only a few sources mention his activities in India. Chandragupta (known in Greek sources as Sandrökottos), founder of the Mauryan empire, had conquered the Indus valley and several other parts of 
2 CONC the easternmost regions of Alexander's empire. Seleucus began a campaign against Chandragupta and crossed the Indus. Seleucus' Indian campaign was, however, a failure. It is unknown what exactly happe
2 CONC ned. Perhaps Chandragupta defeated Seleucus in battle. No sources mention this, however. But as most western historians note, Seleucus appears to have fared poorly as he did not achieve his aims. The 
2 CONC two leaders ultimately reached an agreement, and through a treaty sealed in 305 BC, Seleucus ceded a considerable amount of territory to Chandragupta in exchange for 500 war elephants, which were to p
2 CONC lay a key role in the forthcoming battles, particularly at Ipsus. The victorious Maurya king probably married the daughter of his Greek rival. According to Strabo, the ceded territories bordered the I
2 CONC ndus:
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''The geographical position of the tribes is as follows: along the Indus are the Paropamisadae, above whom lies the Paropamisus mountain: then, towards the south, the Arachoti: then next, towards t

2 CONC held by Indians, although they formerly belonged to the Persians. Alexander [III 'the Great' of Macedon] took these away from the Arians and established settlements of his own, but Seleucus Nicator ga
2 CONC ve them to Sandrocottus [Chandragupta], upon terms of intermarriage and of receiving in exchange five hundred elephants. — Strabo 15.2.9''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>From this, it seems that Seleucus surrendered the easternmost provinces of Arachosia, Gedrosia, Paropamisadae and perhaps also Aria. On the other hand, he was accepted by other satraps of the easte
2 CONC rn provinces. His Persian wife, Apama, may have helped him implement his rule in Bactria and Sogdiana. Mainstream scholarship asserts that Chandragupta received vast territory west of the Indus, inclu
2 CONC ding the Hindu Kush, modern-day Afghanistan, and the Balochistan province of Pakistan. This would tend to be corroborated archaeologically, as concrete indications of Mauryan influence, such as the in
2 CONC scriptions of the Edicts of Ashoka which are known to be located in, for example, Kandhahar in today's southern Afghanistan. However, Ashoka's Edicts were inscribed two generations after any territori
2 CONC al handover by Seleucus and, for this reason, it is equally possible that the land in which these Edicts are to be found was incorporated into the Mauryan empire by Bindusara, Chandragupta's son and s
2 CONC uccessor, or Ashoka himself.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Some authors claim that the argument relating to Seleucus handing over more of what is now southern Afghanistan is an exaggeration originating in a statement by Pliny the Elder referring not specif
2 CONC ically to the lands received by Chandragupta, but rather to the various opinions of geographers regarding the definition of the word "India":
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Most geographers, in fact, do not look upon India as bounded by the river Indus, but add to it the four satrapies of the Gedrose, the Arachotë, the Aria, and the Paropamisadë, the River Cophes 
2 CONC thus forming the extreme boundary of India. According to other writers, however, all these territories, are reckoned as belonging to the country of the Aria. — Pliny, Natural History VI, 23''
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Also the passage of Arrian explaining that Megasthenes lived in Arachosia with the satrap Sibyrtius, from where he traveled to India to visit Chandragupta, goes against the notion that Arachosia wa
2 CONC s under Maurya rule:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Megasthenes lived with Sibyrtius, satrap of Arachosia, and speaks of his often visiting Sandracottus, the king of the Indians. — Arrian, Anabasis Alexandri v,6''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nevertheless, it is usually considered today that Arachosia and the other three regions did become dominions of the Mauryan Empire.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The alliance between Chandragupta and Seleucus was affirmed with a marriage (Epigamia). Chandragupta or his son married the daughter of Seleucus, Cornelia, or perhaps there was diplomatic recogniti
2 CONC on of intermarriage between Indians and Greeks. In addition to this matrimonial recognition or alliance, Seleucus dispatched an ambassador, Megasthenes, to the Mauryan court at Pataliputra (Modern Pat

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''The other parts of the country [beyond the Hydaspes, the farthest extent of Alexander's conquests] were discovered and surveyed by Seleucus Nicator: namely</p>

2 CONT <p>* to the river Ioames (Yamuna) as much: and some copies add 5 miles more therto</p>

2 CONT <p>* to Rhodapha 119, and some say, that between them two it is no less than 325 miles.</p>

2 CONT <p>''Battle of Ipsus''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The war elephants Seleucus received from Chandragupta proved to be useful when the Diadochi finally decided to deal with Antigonus. Cassander, Seleucus and Lysimachus defeated Antigonus and Demetri
2 CONC us in the battle of Ipsus. Antigonus fell in battle, but Demetrius managed to escape. After the battle, Syria was placed under Seleucus' rule. He understood Syria to encompass the region from the Taur
2 CONC us mountains to Sinai, but Ptolemy had already conquered Palestine and Phonicia. In 299 BC, Seleucus allied with Demetrius and married his daughter Stratonice. Stratonice was also the daughter of Anti
2 CONC pater's daughter Phila. Seleucus had a daughter by Stratonice, who was also called Phila.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The fleet of Demetrius managed to destroy Ptolemy's fleet and thus Seleucus did not need to fight him.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus, however, did not manage to enlarge his kingdom to the west. The main reason was that he did not have enough Greek and Macedonian troops. During the battle of Ipsus, he had less infantry t
2 CONC han Lysimachus. His strength was in his war elephants and in traditional Persian cavalry. In order to enlarge his army, Seleucus tried to attract colonists from mainland Greece by founding four new ci
2 CONC ties—Seleucia Pieria and Laodicea in Syria on the coast and Antioch on the Orontes and Apameia in the Orontes River valley. Antioch became his chief seat of government. The new Seleucia was supposed
2 CONC  to become his new naval base and a gateway to the Mediterranean. Seleucus also founded six smaller cities.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It is said of Seleucus that "few princes have ever lived with so great a passion for the building of cities. He is reputed to have built in all nine Seleucias, sixteen Antiochs, and six Laodiceas".

2 CONT <p>''Defeat of Demetrius and Lysimachus''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus nominated his son Antiochus I as his co-ruler and viceroy of the eastern provinces in 292 BC, the vast extent of the empire seeming to require a double government. In 294 BC Stratonice mar
2 CONC ried her stepson Antiochus. Seleucus reportedly instigated the marriage after discovering that his son was in danger of dying of lovesickness. Seleucus was thus able to remove Stratonice out of the wa
2 CONC y, as her father Demetrius had now become king of Macedonia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The alliance between Seleucus and Demetrius ended in 294 BC when Seleucus conquered Cilicia. Demetrius invaded and easily conquered Cilicia in 286 BC, which meant that Demetrius was now threatening
2 CONC  the most important regions of Seleucus' empire in Syria. Demetrius' troops, however, were tired and had not received their payment. Seleucus, on the other hand, was known as a cunning and rich leader
2 CONC  who had earned the adoration of his soldiers. Seleucus blocked the roads leading south from Cilicia and urged Demetrius' troops to join his side. Simultaneously he tried to evade battle with Demetriu
2 CONC s. Finally, Seleucus addressed Demetrius personally. He showed himself in front of the soldiers and removed his helmet, revealing his identity. Demetrius' troops now started to abandon their leader en
2 CONC  massse. Demetrius was finally imprisoned in Apameia and died a few years later in captivity.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus and Ptolemy had supported Seleucus against Demetrius, but after the latter's defeat the alliance started to break apart. Lysimachus ruled Macedonia, Thracia and Asia Minor. He also had p
2 CONC roblems with his family. Lysimachus executed his son Agathocles, whose wife Lysandra escaped to Babylon to Seleucus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The unpopularity of Lysimachus after the murder of Agathocles gave Seleucus an opportunity to remove his last rival. His intervention in the west was solicited by Ptolemy Keraunos, who, on the acce
2 CONC ssion to the Egyptian throne of his brother Ptolemy II (285 BC), had at first taken refuge with Lysimachus and then with Seleucus. Seleucus then invaded Asia Minor and defeated his rival in the Battle
2 CONC  of Corupedium in Lydia, 281 BC. Lysimachus fell in battle. In addition, Ptolemy had died a few years earlier. Seleucus was thus now the only living contemporary of Alexander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Administration of Asia Minor''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Before his death, Seleucus tried to deal with the administration of Asia Minor. The region was ethnically diverse, consisting of Greek cities, a Persian aristocracy and indigenous peoples. Seleucus
2 CONC  perhaps tried to defeat Cappadocia, but failed. Lysimachus' old officer Philetairos ruled Pergamon independently. On the other hand, based on their names, Seleucus apparently founded a number of new 
2 CONC cities in Asia Minor.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Few of the letters Seleucus sent to different cities and temples still exist. All cities in Asia Minor sent embassies to their new ruler. It is reported that Seleucus complained about the number of
2 CONC  letters he received and was forced to read. He was apparently a popular ruler. In Lemnos he was celebrated as a liberator and a temple was built to honour him. According to a local custom, Seleucus w
2 CONC as always offered an extra cup of wine during dinner time. His title during this period was Seleucus Soter ("savior"). When Seleucus left for Europe, the organizational rearrangement of Asia Minor had
2 CONC  not been completed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Death and legacy'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus now held the whole of Alexander's conquests except Egypt and moved to take possession of Macedonia and Thrace. He intended to leave Asia to Antiochus and content himself for the remainder 
2 CONC of his days with the Macedonian kingdom in its old limits. He had, however, hardly crossed into the Thracian Chersonese when he was assassinated by Ptolemy Keraunos near Lysimachia September (281 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It seems certain that after taking Macedonia and Thracia, Seleucus would have tried to conquer Greece. He had already prepared this campaign using the numerous gifts presented to him. He was also n
2 CONC ominated an honorary citizen of Athens.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antiochus founded the cult of his father. A cult of personality formed around the later members of the Seleucid dynasty and Seleucus was later worshipped as a son of god. One inscription found in I
2 CONC lion advises priests to sacrifice to Apollo, the ancestor of Antiochus' family. Several anecdotes of Seleucus' life became popular in the classical world.

2 CONT <p>Lysimachus sets himself up in Thrace.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Military clashes eventually occur as each tries to encroach on theother's territory. Ptolemy annexes Phoenicia to his possessions andplaces garrisons in the Phoenician port cities. Antigonus too de

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Returning from successful wars in Babylonia, Antigonus easily takes overthe cities of Phoenicia but meets with firm resistance from Tyre.Seventeen years have passed since Alexander took Tyre and th
2 CONC e city hasrecovered rapidly. Antigonus has few ships as Ptolemy is holding allPhoenician vessels and their crews in Egypt, so he decides to build afleet of his own. He camps before Tyre, summons all t
2 CONC he kings of thePhoenician cities and the viceroys of Syria and demands them to assisthim in building ships.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus blockades Tyre by land. He establishes three shipyards, one atTripolis, one at Byblos, one at Sidon. Diodorus Siculus records thatAntigonus collects wood-cutters, sawyers and shipwrights 
2 CONC from all regionsand has wood carried from the mountains of Lebanon to the sea. Eightthousand men are employed to cut and saw the timber; one thousand pairsof draught animals are used to transport it. 
2 CONC "This mountain range",Diodorus (19.58.3-5) writes, "extends along the territory of Tripolis,Byblos and Sidon and is covered with cedar and cypress trees of wonderfulbeauty and size." We thus have a de
2 CONC scription of the extent of theluxuriant forests covering the mountains of Lebanon about two thousandthree hundred years ago.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After a siege of fifteen months, Tyre is taken by Antigonus. He allowsPtolemy's garrison to leave and establishes his own in the city.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In order to enhance their personal prestige, Alexander's successorsstrike their own coins. On the obverse of his early silver coinage,Ptolemy has engraved the head of the newly deified Alexander wi
2 CONC th thesacred ram's horns of Ammon and an elephant headdress. Alexander's name,not his, appears on the reverse of his coins.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the coins of Seleucus, Alexander is portrayed as the god Dionysuswearing a helmet covered with panther skin adorned with a bull's ear andhorns.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus in his turn presents on his coins the diademed head ofAlexander, deified, wearing the sacred horns of Ammon. When Alexanderconquered Egypt, he was hailed by the high-priest of Ammon as t
2 CONC he son ofthe god and Alexander's generals are determined to let no one forget it.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 305 B.C. Antigonus and his son Demetrius assume the title of king.Ptolemy, Cassander, Lysimachus and Seleucus react to the challenge bydoing the same. Henceforth the effigies of these men, weari
2 CONC ng theMacedonian diadem, appear on their gold and silver coins. Their patrongods appear on the reverse. This ushurs in the age of royal portraiture.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The battle of lpsus in Phrygia in 301, called the "battle of the kings",signals the great military clash between Alexander's generals. The warelephant plays an important role in the outcome of this
2 CONC  battle and is thesymbol of military strength. The armies of Seleucus and Lysimachus withone hundred and fifty elephants cut off the infantry of Antigonus, leftmortally wounded on the battlefield.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Notwithstanding, his son Demetrius rules Phoenicia until 287 when it onceagain passes back to Ptolemy. It remains a dependency of the Ptolemiesfor nearly seventy years. In the year 285 Alexander's

2 CONC  of Alexander the Great, he rose from governor of Babylon to king of an empire centring on Syria and Iran.
2 CONT <p>Early life and ascent to power</p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus was the son of Antiochus, a general of Philip II of Macedonia, the father of Alexander the Great. Seleucus participated in the conquest of the Persian empire as one of Alexander's officers
2 CONC , and in 326he commanded the Macedonian infantry against King Porus of India in battle on the Hydaspes River. In 324 Alexander ordered a mass wedding ceremony at Susa (in Persia) to put into practice 
2 CONC his ideal of uniting the peoples of Macedonia and Persia. On this occasion Seleucus marriedApama, the daughter of Spitamenes, the ruler of Bactria. Of all the Macedonian nobles, he was the only one wh
2 CONC o did not repudiate his wife after Alexander's death.
2 CONT <p>After Alexander died (323), Seleucus was given the command of the hetairoi (companions) cavalry and took part in the regent Perdiccas' campaign to oust Ptolemy, the governor (satrap) of Egypt. In E
2 CONC gypt, however, he joined with others in the assassination of Perdiccas. When the empire was divided in 321, he was given the governorship (satrapy) of Babylon. At the same time Antigonus Monophthalmus
2 CONC  (the One-Eyed) had been placed in command of a campaign against Eumenes of Cardia, a supporter of Perdiccas. In 317 Seleucus aided Antigonus but, after Eumenes' execution in 316, Antigonus demanded t
2 CONC hat Seleucus give an accounting of the income from his satrapy. Seleucus refused to give the accounting and escaped capture by fleeing to Ptolemy in Egypt.
2 CONT <p>From 316 to 312 Seleucus remained in Ptolemy's service. He took the initiative in forging a coalition among Ptolemy, Lysimachus (the ruler of Thrace), and Cassander (who laid claim to Macedonia) ag
2 CONC ainst Antigonus, whose desire to become the ruler of the whole of Alexander's empire was a threat to them all. In the resulting coalition war (315-311),Seleucus was made one of Ptolemy's generals and 
2 CONC jointly with him commanded the Ptolemaic troops that defeated the force of Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, at the Battle of Gaza in southern Syria (312).
2 CONT <p>Seleucus once again turned his attention to returning to Babylonia, and in August 312 he was able to reconquer Babylon with only a small army. This conquest marked the beginning of the Seleucid era
2 CONC , which is dated Dios 1 (Oct. 7), 312, in the Macedonian calendar and Nisan 1 (April 3), 311, in the Babylonian calendar. Antigonus ordered Nicanor, oneof his generals, to invade Babylonia from the ea
2 CONC st and his son Demetrius to attack it from the west, but they failed to oust Seleucus. WhenAntigonus made peace with his enemies in 311, Seleucus was not included.
2 CONT <p>Consolidation of gains.</p>
2 CONT <p>Little is known about the next few years of Seleucus' reign; he presumably used them to consolidate his gains. In the year 305 he followed the example of the other successors and assumed the title 
2 CONC of king (basileus). He embarked on an expansion of his kingdom throughout the Iranian east (the upper satrapies) as far as India, but his advance was eventually halted by Candragupta, the founder of t
2 CONC he Maurya dynasty of India. In a pact concluded by the two potentates, Seleucus agreed to territorial concessions in exchange for 500 elephants.
2 CONT <p>Developments in the west also caused Seleucus to end his campaign in India (303). He had joined a coalition that Ptolemy, Cassander, and Lysimachus had once again formed against Antigonus and Demet
2 CONC rius. In thewinter of 302 Seleucus was back in Asia Minor and, together with Cassander and Lysimachus, defeated Antigonus in the Battle of Ipsus (301).The victors divided the lands of their enemy amon
2 CONC g them, with Seleucus being given Syria. The southern part of Syria, Coele Syria, had in the meantime been occupied by Ptolemy, who had not taken part in the war. This gave rise to the long series of 
2 CONC Syrian wars between the Seleucids and Ptolemies. For the time being, however, Seleucus declined to enforce his claim; he merely transferred his capital from Seleucia on the Tigris to the newly founded
2 CONC  city of Antioch on the Orontes (301-300).
2 CONT <p>Ptolemy, anxious to improve relations with Lysimachus, had given him his daughter Arsinoe in marriage. To provide a counterbalance, Seleucus asked for the hand of Stratonice, the daughter of Demetr
2 CONC ius, and in298 the wedding was held with much pomp at Rhosus in Syria. Soon, however, Seleucus' territorial demands (e.g., the surrender of Cilicia and the cities of Tyre and Sidon) ruptured the previ
2 CONC ously harmonious relationship with Demetrius.
2 CONT <p>In 294 a sensational scandal occurred at the court of Seleucus. Antiochus, his son by Apama, fell in love with his beautiful stepmother, Stratonice, and his unrequited passion affected his health. 
2 CONC Seleucus gave him Stratonice, assigned him as commander in chief to the upper satrapies, and appointed him co-regent.
2 CONT <p>In 285 Seleucus took Demetrius prisoner, thus foiling his attempt to conquer Asia, and interned him in Apamea, where he died in 283. Subsequently, Seleucus intervened in dissensions in the house of
2 CONC  Lysimachus,who had had his son Agathocles assassinated. In February 281 Lysimachus fell in a battle against Seleucus at Corupedium, and Seleucus gained control of Lysimachus' kingdom. He was now near
2 CONC  his goal of reestablishing Alexander's empire. He crossed over to Europe to enter Macedonia, but at the end of August or beginning of September 281, he was murdered by Ptolemy Ceraunus, who had been 
2 CONC passed over by his father, Ptolemy, as successor to the Egyptian throne. Seleucus' son and successor, Antiochus I, entombed his father's ashes in Seleucia, initiated (probably) the posthumous cult of 
2 CONC his father, and ordered his veneration as Zeus Nicator.
2 CONT <p>Seleucus was an energetic ruler, creating the Seleucid Empire, which gained its greatest expansion under his rule. He took great interest in the administration of his territories and founded many n
2 CONC ew cities. He also encouraged scientific research: Patrocles explored the CaspianSea and Megasthenes the Ganges River. A bronze bust--a very impressive likeness of him, conveying his imposing personal

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus was the son of Antiochus, one of Philip's generals, and of Laodice. In 333 BC, as a young man of about twenty-three, he accompanied Alexander into Asia and won distinction in the Indian ca
2 CONC mpaign of 326 BC. When the Macedonian empire was divided in 323 BC (the "Partition of Babylon"), Seleucus was given the office of chiliarch, which attached him closely to the regent Perdiccas. Subsequ
2 CONC ently, Seleucus had a hand in the murder of Perdiccas during the latter's unsuccessful invasion of Egypt in 321 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the second partition, at Triparadisus (321 BC), Seleucus was given the government of the Babylonian satrapy. In 316 BC, when Antigonus had made himself master of the eastern provinces, Seleucus 
2 CONC felt himself threatened and fled to Egypt. In the war which followed between Antigonus and the other Macedonian chiefs, Seleucus actively cooperated with Ptolemy and commanded Egyptian squadrons in th
2 CONC e Aegean Sea.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The victory won by Ptolemy at the battle of Gaza in 312 BC opened the way for Seleucus to return to the east. His return to Babylon was afterwards officially regarded as the beginning of the Seleuc
2 CONC id Empire and that year as the first of the Seleucid era. Master of Babylonia, Seleucus at once proceeded to wrest the neighbouring provinces of Persia, Susiana and Media from the nominees of Antigonu
2 CONC s. A raid into Babylonia conducted in 311 BC by Demetrius, son of Antigonus, did not seriously check Seleucus' progress. Over the course of nine years (311-302 BC), while Antigonus was occupied in the
2 CONC  west, Seleucus brought the whole eastern part of Alexander's empire as far as the Jaxartes and Indus Rivers under his authority.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 305 BC, after the extinction of the old royal line of Macedonia, Seleucus, like the other four principal Macedonian chiefs, assumed the title and style of King. He established Seleucia on the Ti
2 CONC gris as his capital.</p>

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the year 305 BC Seleucus I Nicator went to India, where he encountered Chandragupta Maurya. Through a treaty sealed in 303 BC, Seleucus ceded what is now Pakistan and southern Afghanistan but re
2 CONC ceived 500 elephants, which were to play a key role in the battles that were to come. To cement the treaty, there was either some sort of marriage alliance involving Seleucus' daughter or the diplomat
2 CONC ic recognition of intermarriage between Indians and Greeks.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    "The Indians occupy [in part] some of the countries situated along the Indus, which formerly belonged to the Persians: Alexander deprived the Ariani of them, and established there settlements o
2 CONC f his own. But Seleucus Nicator gave them to Sandrocottus in consequence of a marriage contract, and received in return five hundred elephants." Strabo 15.2.1(9) [1]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>    "Always lying in wait for the neighboring nations, strong in arms and persuasive in council, he [Seleucus] acquired Mesopotamia, Armenia, 'Seleucid' Cappadocia, Persis, Parthia, Bactria, Arabia
2 CONC , Tapouria, Sogdia, Arachosia, Hyrcania, and other adjacent peoples that had been subdued by Alexander, as far as the river Indus, so that the boundaries of his empire were the most extensive in Asia 
2 CONC after that of Alexander. The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus. He crossed the Indus and waged war with Sandrocottus [Maurya], king of the Indians, who dwelt on the banks 
2 CONC of that stream, until they came to an understanding with each other and contracted a marriage relationship." Appian, History of Rome, The Syrian Wars 55 [2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In addition to this matrimonial alliance, Seleucus' dispatched an ambassador, Megasthenes, to the Mauryan court at Pataliputra (Modern Patna in Bihar state).</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Seleucus himself took as wife Apama, whom he had three children with: two daughters, Apama and Laodice and sons Antiochus & Achaeus. After the death of Apama, Seleucus married Stratonice, daughter 
2 CONC of Demetrius Poliorcetes, Seleucus had a daughter by Stratonice, who was called Phila.[1]

2 CONT <p>Asia Minor</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 301 BC he joined Lysimachus in Asia Minor, and at Ipsus Antigonus fell before their combined power. A new partition of the empire followed, by which Seleucus added to his kingdom Syria, and perh
2 CONC aps some regions of Asia Minor.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The possession of Syria gave him an opening to the Mediterranean, and he immediately founded the new city of Antioch on the Orontes as his chief seat of government. Seleucia on the Tigris continued
2 CONC  to be the capital for the eastern satrapies. About 293 BC, he installed his son Antiochus there as viceroy, the vast extent of the empire seeming to require a double government.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>It is said of Seleucus that "few princes have ever lived with so great a passion for the building of cities. He is reputed to have built in all nine Seleucias, sixteen Antiochs, and six Laodiceas"[
2 CONC 3].</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The capture of Demetrius in 285 BC added to Seleucus's prestige. The unpopularity of Lysimachus after the murder of Agathocles gave Seleucus an opportunity for removing his last rival. His interven
2 CONC tion in the west was solicited by Ptolemy Keraunos, who, on the accession to the Egyptian throne of his brother Ptolemy II (285 BC), had at first taken refuge with Lysimachus and then with Seleucus. W
2 CONC ar between Seleucus and Lysimachus broke out, and at the decisive battle of Corupedium in Lydia, Lysimachus fell (281 BC). Seleucus now held the whole of Alexander's conquests excepting Egypt in his h
2 CONC ands, and moved to take possession of Macedonia and Thrace. He intended to leave Asia to Antiochus and content himself for the remainder of his days with the Macedonian kingdom in its old limits. He h
2 CONC ad, however, hardly crossed into the Chersonese when he was assassinated by Ptolemy Keraunos near Lysimachia (281 BC).

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Demetrius I (Greek: Δημήτριος, 337-283 BC), called Poliorcetes (Greek: Πολιορκητής - "The Besieger"), son of Antigonus I Monophthalmus and Stratonice, was a king of
2 CONC  Macedon (294–288 BC). He belonged to the Antigonid dynasty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the age of twenty-two he was left by his father to defend Syria against Ptolemy the son of Lagus; he was totally defeated in Battle of Gaza, but soon partially repaired his loss by a victory in 
2 CONC the neighbourhood of Myus. In the spring of 310, he was soundly defeated when he tried to expel Seleucus I Nicator from Babylon; his father was defeated in the autumn. As a result of this Babylonian W
2 CONC ar, Antigonus lost almost two thirds of his empire: all eastern satrapies became Seleucus'.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After several campaigns against Ptolemy on the coasts of Cilicia and Cyprus, Demetrius sailed with a fleet of 250 ships to Athens. He freed the city from the power of Cassander and Ptolemy, expelle
2 CONC d the garrison which had been stationed there under Demetrius of Phalerum, and besieged and took Munychia (307 BC). After these victories he was worshipped by the Athenians as a tutelary deity under t
2 CONC he title of Soter (σωτήρ) ("Preserver").
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the campaign of 306 BC against Ptolemy he defeated Menelaus, Ptolemy's brother, in the naval Battle of Salamis, completely destroying the naval power of Egypt. In 305 BC, now bearing the title o
2 CONC f king bestowed upon him by his father, he endeavoured to punish the Rhodians for having deserted his cause; his ingenuity in devising new siege engines in his unsuccessful attempt to reduce the capit
2 CONC al gained him the title of Poliorcetes. Among his creations were a battering ram 180 feet (55 m) long, requiring 1000 men to operate it; and a wheeled siege tower named "Helepolis" (or "Taker of Citie
2 CONC s") which stood 125 feet (38 m) tall and 60 feet (18 m) wide, weighing 360,000 pounds.

2 CONT <p>Coin of Demetrius I (337-283 BC). Greek inscription reads ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΔΗΜΗΤΡΙΟΥ ([coin] of King Demetrius)In 302 BC he returned a second time to Greece as liberator, and reinstated th
2 CONC e Corinthian League. But his licentiousness and extravagance made the Athenians long for the government of Cassander. Among his outrages was his courtship of a young boy named Democles the Handsome. T
2 CONC he youth kept on refusing his attention but one day found himself cornered at the baths. Having no way out and being unable to physically resist his suitor, he took the lid off the hot water cauldron 
2 CONC and jumped in. His death is seen as a mark of honor for himself and his country. In another instance, he waived a fine of 50 talents imposed on a citizen in exchange for the favors of Cleaenetus, that
2 CONC  man's son.[1] He also sought the attention of Lamia, a Greek courtesan. She demanded a price of 250 talents. He put a tax on soap to raise the money.[2]
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He also roused the jealousy of Alexander's Diadochi; Seleucus, Cassander and Lysimachus united to destroy him and his father. The hostile armies met at the Ipsus in Phrygia (301 BC). Antigonus was 
2 CONC killed, and Demetrius, after sustaining severe losses, retired to Ephesus. This reversal of fortune stirred up many enemies against him—the Athenians refused even to admit him into their city. But h
2 CONC e soon afterwards ravaged the territory of Lysimachus and effected a reconciliation with Seleucus, to whom he gave his daughter Stratonice in marriage. Athens was at this time oppressed by the tyranny
2 CONC  of Lachares - a popular leader who made himself supreme in Athens in 296 BC - but Demetrius, after a protracted blockade, gained possession of the city (294 BC) and pardoned the inhabitants for their
2 CONC  misconduct in 301.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the same year he established himself on the throne of Macedonia by murdering Alexander V, the son of Cassander. In 291 BC he married Lanassa, the former wife of Pyrrhus. But his new position as 
2 CONC ruler of Macedonia was continually threatened by Pyrrhus, who took advantage of his occasional absence to ravage the defenceless part of his kingdom (Plutarch, Pyrrhus, 7 if.); at length, the combined
2 CONC  forces of Pyrrhus, Ptolemy and Lysimachus, assisted by the disaffected among his own subjects, obliged him to leave Macedonia in 288 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He passed into Asia and attacked some of the provinces of Lysimachus with varying success. Famine and pestilence destroyed the greater part of his army, and he solicited Seleucus' support and assis
2 CONC tance. But before he reached Syria hostilities broke out, and after he had gained some advantages over his son-in-law, Demetrius was totally forsaken by his troops on the field of battle and surrender
2 CONC ed to Seleucus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His son Antigonus offered all his possessions, and even his own person, in order to procure his father's liberty. But all proved unavailing, and Demetrius died after a confinement of three years (2
2 CONC 83 BC). His remains were given to Antigonus and honoured with a splendid funeral at Corinth.

2 CONT <p>'''Biography'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At the age of twenty-two he was left by his father to defend Syria against Ptolemy the son of Lagus. He was defeated at the Battle of Gaza, but soon partially repaired his loss by a victory in the 
2 CONC neighbourhood of Myus. In the spring of 310, he was soundly defeated when he tried to expel Seleucus I Nicator from Babylon; his father was defeated in the autumn. As a result of this Babylonian War, 
2 CONC Antigonus lost almost two thirds of his empire: all eastern satrapies fell to Seleucus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After several campaigns against Ptolemy on the coasts of Cilicia and Cyprus, Demetrius sailed with a fleet of 250 ships to Athens. He freed the city from the power of Cassander and Ptolemy, expelle
2 CONC d the garrison which had been stationed there under Demetrius of Phalerum, and besieged and took Munychia (307 BC). After these victories he was worshipped by the Athenians as a tutelary deity under t
2 CONC he title of Soter (σωτήρ) ("Preserver").
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the campaign of 306 BC he defeated Ptolemy and Menelaus, Ptolemy's brother, in the naval Battle of Salamis, completely destroying the naval power of Ptolemaic Egypt. Demetrius conquered Cyprus i
2 CONC n 306 BC, capturing one of Ptolemy's sons. Following the victory Antigonus assumed the title king and bestowed the same upon his son Demetrius. In 305 BC, now bearing the title of king bestowed upon h
2 CONC im by his father, he endeavoured to punish the Rhodians for having deserted his cause; his ingenuity in devising new siege engines in his unsuccessful attempt to reduce the capital gained him the titl
2 CONC e of Poliorcetes. Among his creations were a battering ram 180 feet (55 m) long, requiring 1000 men to operate it; and a wheeled siege tower named "Helepolis" (or "Taker of Cities") which stood 125 fe
2 CONC et (38 m) tall and 60 feet (18 m) wide, weighing 360,000 pounds.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 302 BC he returned a second time to Greece as liberator, and reinstated the Corinthian League. But his licentiousness and extravagance made the Athenians long for the government of Cassander. Am
2 CONC ong his outrages was his courtship of a young boy named Democles the Handsome. The youth kept on refusing his attention but one day found himself cornered at the baths. Having no way out and being una
2 CONC ble to physically resist his suitor, he took the lid off the hot water cauldron and jumped in. His death was seen as a mark of honor for himself and his country. In another instance, Demetrius waived 
2 CONC a fine of 50 talents imposed on a citizen in exchange for the favors of Cleaenetus, that man's son.[3] He also sought the attention of Lamia, a Greek courtesan. He demanded 250 talents from the Atheni
2 CONC ans, which he then gave to Lamia and other courtesans to buy soap and cosmetics.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He also roused the jealousy of Alexander's Diadochi; Seleucus, Cassander and Lysimachus united to destroy him and his father. The hostile armies met at the Battle of Ipsus in Phrygia (301 BC). Anti
2 CONC gonus was killed, and Demetrius, after sustaining severe losses, retired to Ephesus. This reversal of fortune stirred up many enemies against him—the Athenians refused even to admit him into their c
2 CONC ity. But he soon afterwards ravaged the territory of Lysimachus and effected a reconciliation with Seleucus, to whom he gave his daughter Stratonice in marriage. Athens was at this time oppressed by t
2 CONC he tyranny of Lachares—a popular leader who made himself supreme in Athens in 296 BC—but Demetrius, after a protracted blockade, gained possession of the city (294 BC) and pardoned the inhabitants
2 CONC  for their misconduct in 301.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''King of Macedonia''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 294 he established himself on the throne of Macedonia by murdering Alexander V, the son of Cassander. He faced rebellion from the Boeotians but secured the region after capturing Thebes in 291 B
2 CONC C. That year he married Lanassa, the former wife of Pyrrhus. But his new position as ruler of Macedonia was continually threatened by Pyrrhus, who took advantage of his occasional absence to ravage th
2 CONC e defenceless part of his kingdom (Plutarch, Pyrrhus, 7 if.); at length, the combined forces of Pyrrhus, Ptolemy and Lysimachus, assisted by the disaffected among his own subjects, obliged him to leav
2 CONC e Macedonia in 288 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After besieging Athens without success he passed into Asia and attacked some of the provinces of Lysimachus with varying success. Famine and pestilence destroyed the greater part of his army, and h
2 CONC e solicited Seleucus' support and assistance. But before he reached Syria hostilities broke out, and after he had gained some advantages over his son-in-law, Demetrius was totally forsaken by his troo
2 CONC ps on the field of battle and surrendered to Seleucus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>His son Antigonus offered all his possessions, and even his own person, in order to procure his father's liberty. But all proved unavailing, and Demetrius died after a confinement of three years (2
2 CONC 83 BC). His remains were given to Antigonus and honoured with a splendid funeral at Corinth. His descendants remained in possession of the Macedonian throne till the time of Perseus, when Macedon was 
2 CONC conquered by the Romans in 168 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Family'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrius was married five times:</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p># His first wife was Phila daughter of Regent Antipater by whom he had two children: Stratonice of Syria and Antigonus II Gonatas.</p>
2 CONT <p># His second wife was Eurydice of Athens, by whom he is said to have had a son called Corrhabus.</p>
2 CONT <p># His third wife was Deidamia, a sister of Pyrrhus of Epirus. Deidamia bore him a son called Alexander who is said by Plutarch to have spent his life in Egypt, probably in an honourable captivity.<
2 CONC /p>
2 CONT <p># His fourth wife was Lanassa, the former wife of his brother-in-law Pyrrhus of Epirus.</p>
2 CONT <p># His fifth wife was Ptolemais, daughter of Ptolemy I Soter and Eurydice of Egypt, by whom he had a son called Demetrius the Fair.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He also had an affair with a celebrated courtesan called Lamia of Athens, by whom he had a daughter called Phila.</p>

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Plutarch''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Plutarch wrote a biography of Demetrius (http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Demetrius*.html)</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Hegel''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Hegel, in the Lectures on the History of Philosophy, says of another Demetrius, Demetrius Phalereus that "Demetrius Phalereus and others were thus soon after [Alexander] honoured and worshipped in 
2 CONC Athens as God." What the exact source was for Hegel's claim is unclear. Diogenes Laërtius in his short biography of Demetrius Phalereus does not mention this. Apparently Hegel's error comes from a mi
2 CONC sreading of Plutarch's Life of Demetrius which is about Demetrius Poliorcetes and not Demetrius of Phalereus. Plutarch describes in the work how Demetrius Poliorcetes conquered Demetrius Phalereus at 
2 CONC Athens. Then, in chapter 12 of the work, Plutarch describes how Demetrius Poliorcetes was given honors due to the god Dionysus. This account by Plutarch was confusing not only for Hegel, but for other
2 CONC s as well.

2 CONT <p>Military clashes eventually occur as each tries to encroach on theother's territory. Ptolemy annexes Phoenicia to his possessions andplaces garrisons in the Phoenician port cities. Antigonus too de

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Returning from successful wars in Babylonia, Antigonus easily takes overthe cities of Phoenicia but meets with firm resistance from Tyre.Seventeen years have passed since Alexander took Tyre and th
2 CONC e city hasrecovered rapidly. Antigonus has few ships as Ptolemy is holding allPhoenician vessels and their crews in Egypt, so he decides to build afleet of his own. He camps before Tyre, summons all t
2 CONC he kings of thePhoenician cities and the viceroys of Syria and demands them to assisthim in building ships.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus blockades Tyre by land. He establishes three shipyards, one atTripolis, one at Byblos, one at Sidon. Diodorus Siculus records thatAntigonus collects wood-cutters, sawyers and shipwrights 
2 CONC from all regionsand has wood carried from the mountains of Lebanon to the sea. Eightthousand men are employed to cut and saw the timber; one thousand pairsof draught animals are used to transport it. 
2 CONC "This mountain range",Diodorus (19.58.3-5) writes, "extends along the territory of Tripolis,Byblos and Sidon and is covered with cedar and cypress trees of wonderfulbeauty and size." We thus have a de

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After a siege of fifteen months, Tyre is taken by Antigonus. He allowsPtolemy's garrison to leave and establishes his own in the city.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In order to enhance their personal prestige, Alexander's successorsstrike their own coins. On the obverse of his early silver coinage,Ptolemy has engraved the head of the newly deified Alexander wi

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>On the coins of Seleucus, Alexander is portrayed as the god Dionysuswearing a helmet covered with panther skin adorned with a bull's ear andhorns.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Lysimachus in his turn presents on his coins the diademed head ofAlexander, deified, wearing the sacred horns of Ammon. When Alexanderconquered Egypt, he was hailed by the high-priest of Ammon as t
2 CONC he son ofthe god and Alexander's generals are determined to let no one forget it.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 305 B.C. Antigonus and his son Demetrius assume the title of king.Ptolemy, Cassander, Lysimachus and Seleucus react to the challenge bydoing the same. Henceforth the effigies of these men, weari
2 CONC ng theMacedonian diadem, appear on their gold and silver coins. Their patrongods appear on the reverse. This ushurs in the age of royal portraiture.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The battle of lpsus in Phrygia in 301, called the "battle of the kings",signals the great military clash between Alexander's generals. The warelephant plays an important role in the outcome of this
2 CONC  battle and is thesymbol of military strength. The armies of Seleucus and Lysimachus withone hundred and fifty elephants cut off the infantry of Antigonus, leftmortally wounded on the battlefield.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Notwithstanding, his son Demetrius rules Phoenicia until 287 when it onceagain passes back to Ptolemy. It remains a dependency of the Ptolemiesfor nearly seventy years. In the year 285 Alexander's 
2 CONC empire is neatlydivided between three of his former generals, Ptolemy in Egypt, Seleucusin Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, and Lysimachus in Thrace.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>At his death at the age of eight-four Ptolemy leaves behind him a wellorganized kingdom and the great library at Alexandria. He is succeeded byhis son, Ptolemy 11 Philadelphus (285-246).</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The persistent lug of war between Ptolemies and Seleucids over Phoenicia,Syria and Palestine also results in great cultural changes in the region.Phoenician is discarded as a literary language and

2 CONT <p>Byblos is the center for the worship of Adonis, a youth of great beauty,loved by Aphrodite. In legendary tradition, Adonis is hunting the wildboar one day in the company of Aphrodite at Afka, the s

2 CONT <p>Phila (Greek: Φίλα; died 287 BC), daughter of Antipater, the regent of Macedonia, is celebrated by the ancient sources as one of the noblest and most virtuous women of the age in which she live

2 CONT <p>'''Biography'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Antonius Diogenes, she was married to Balacrus (probably the satrap of Cappadocia of that name) as early as 332 BC. In 322 BC, her father gave her in marriage to Craterus as a reward f
2 CONC or his assistance to Antipater in the Lamian War. After the death of Craterus a year later, she was again married to the young Demetrius Poliorcetes, the son of Antigonus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The date of her marriage is assumed to have taken place between 319 BC and 315, since the remains of her late husband were consigned to her care by Ariston, the friend of Eumenes in 315 BC. Despite
2 CONC  the large difference in age, Phila appears to have had great influence over her youthful husband, who treated her with the utmost respect and consideration, and towards whom she had great affection i
2 CONC n spite of his numerous amours and subsequent marriages. During the many vicissitudes of fortune which Demetrius experienced, Phila seems to have resided principally in Cyprus from whence she sent let
2 CONC ters and costly presents to her husband during the siege of Rhodes.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the Battle of Ipsus, she joined Demetrius, who sent her to her brother Cassander in Macedonia, to endeavour to effect a reconciliation and treaty between him and Demetrius. She appears to hav

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Alexander was founding the new city of Alexandria Eschate on the Jaxartes river, news came that Spitamenes had roused Sogdiana against him and was besieging the Macedonian garrison in Maracand
2 CONC a. Too occupied at the moment to personally confront Spitamenes he sent an army under the command of Pharnuches which was promptly annihilated with a loss of no less than 2000 infantry and 300 cavalry
2 CONC .
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The uprising now posed a direct threat to his army, and Alexander moved personally to relieve Maracanda, only to learn that Spitamenes had left Sogdiana, attacking now Bactra, from where he was rep

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The decisive point came in December 328 BC when Spitamenes was defeated by Alexander's general Coenus at the Battle of Gabai. Spitamenes' wife killed him and sent his head to Alexander, suing for p

2 CONT <p>'''Antigonus I Monophthalmus'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus I Monophthalmus (Ancient Greek: Ἀντίγονος ὁ Μονόφθαλμος, Antigonus the One-eyed, 382–301 BC), son of Philip from Elimeia, was a Macedonian nobleman, general, and

2 CONC stablishing the Antigonid dynasty.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Biography'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''Career''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus was appointed governor of Greater Phrygia in 333 BC. He was primarily responsible for defending Alexander's lines of supply and communication during the latter's extended campaign against
2 CONC  the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Following Alexander's victory at Issus, the Persian mercenary commander Memnon of Rhodes ordered a counter-attack into Asia Minor in an attempt to sever Alexander's lin
2 CONC es of supply and communication; however, Antigonus defeated the Persian forces in three separate battles.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As part of the division of the provinces after Alexander's death in 323 BC, Antigonus also received Pamphylia and Lycia from Perdiccas, regent of the empire, at the Partition of Babylon. He incurre
2 CONC d the enmity of Perdiccas, the regent, by refusing to assist Eumenes to obtain possession of the provinces allotted to him, Paphlagonia and Cappadocia. Leonnatus had left with his army for Greece, lea
2 CONC ving Antigonus alone to deal with Cappadocia, a task he apparently couldn't complete without additional aid.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Perdiccas seems to have viewed this as a direct affront to his authority and went up with the royal army himself to conquer the area. From there Perdiccas turned west towards Phrygia in order to hu
2 CONC mble Antigonus, who escaped with his son Demetrius to Greece, where he obtained the favour of Antipater, regent of Macedonia (321 BC), and Craterus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>With the death of Perdiccas in 321 BC, a new attempt at division of the empire took place at Triparadisus and Antigonus found himself entrusted with the command of the war against Eumenes, who had 
2 CONC joined Perdiccas against the coalition of Antipater, Antigonus, Ptolemy, Craterus, and the other generals. Eumenes was defeated and forced to retire to the fortress of Nora (Greek: Νῶρα) in Cappa
2 CONC docia, and a new army that was marching to his relief was routed by Antigonus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>When Antipater died in 319 BC, he gave the regentship to Polyperchon, excluding Cassander, his son. Antigonus and the other dynasts refused to recognize Polyperchon, since it would undermine their 
2 CONC own ambitions. He entered into negotiations with Eumenes, but Eumenes had already been swayed by Polyperchon, who also gave him authority over anyone within the empire. Effecting his escape from Nora,
2 CONC  he raised an army and built a fleet in Cilicia and Phoenicia, and soon after formed a coalition with the satraps of the eastern provinces. Antigonus fought against Eumenes in two great battles at Par
2 CONC aitacene in 317 BC and Gabiene in 316 BC. Both were inconclusive, however. Yet in the aftermath of the second battle, Antigonus managed to capture the family and riches of the Silvershields, an elite 
2 CONC regiment within Eumenes' army, who in turn handed over Eumenes to Antigonus in return for their release. After some deliberation, Antigonus had Eumenes executed.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>As a result, Antigonus now was in possession of the empire's Asian territories, his authority stretching from the eastern satrapies to Syria and Asia Minor in the west. He seized the treasures at S
2 CONC usa and entered Babylon. The governor of the city, Seleucus fled to Ptolemy and entered into a league with him, Lysimachus and Cassander (315 BC) against Antigonus. In 314 BC Antigonus invaded Phoenic
2 CONC ia, under Ptolemy's control, and besieged Tyre for more than a year. His son Demetrius was defeated at the Battle of Gaza by Ptolemy in 312 BC, and after the battle, Seleucus made his way back to Baby
2 CONC lonia. Seleucus returned to Babylon let him build up a base of his own, and he soon established control of the eastern satrapies. The Babylonian War began between Antigonus and Seleucus, where Seleucu
2 CONC s defeated both Demetrius and Antigonus, and secured Babylonia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the war had been carried on with varying success from 315 to 311, peace was concluded, by which the government of Asia Minor and Syria was provisionally secured to Antigonus. This agreement w
2 CONC as soon violated on the pretext that garrisons had been placed in some of the free Greek cities by Antigonus, and Ptolemy and Cassander renewed hostilities against him. Demetrius Poliorcetes, the son 
2 CONC of Antigonus, wrested part of Greece from Cassander.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After defeating Ptolemy at the naval Battle of Salamis in 306 BC, Demetrius conquered Cyprus. Following the victory Antigonus assumed the title king and bestowed the same upon his son, a declaratio
2 CONC n that he now was independent from the empire. The other dynasts, Cassander, Ptolemy, Lysimachus and Seleucus, soon followed. He now prepared a large army and a formidable fleet, the command of which 
2 CONC he gave to Demetrius, and hastened to attack Ptolemy in his own dominions. His invasion of Egypt, however, proved a failure; he was unable to penetrate Ptolemy's defences and was obliged to retire, ye
2 CONC t inflicting high losses on Ptolemy. Demetrius in 305 BC attempted the reduction of Rhodes, which had refused to assist Antigonus against Egypt. The siege of Rhodes lasted a year and ended in 304 BC w
2 CONC hen Demetrius, meeting with obstinate resistance, was obliged to make a peace treaty upon the terms that the Rhodians would build ships for Antigonus and aid him against any enemy except for Ptolemy, 
2 CONC on whom they bestowed the title Soter (savior) for his aid during the lengthy siege.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>''The dynasts unite against Antigonus''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The most powerful dynasts of the empire, now kings in their own right, Cassander, Seleucus, Ptolemy and Lysimachus, responded to Antigonus's successes by allying with each other, often through marr
2 CONC iage. Antigonus soon found himself at war with all four, largely because his territory shared borders with each of them. Once he had Cassander in a bad position, having gained the support of the Greek
2 CONC s and defeating him repeatedly, he demanded from Cassander the unconditional submission of Macedonia. Seleucus, Lysimachus and Ptolemy responded by joining forces and attacking him. Lysimachus invaded
2 CONC  Asia Minor from Thrace, crossing the Hellespont. He had soon secured most of the Ionian cities, and Seleucus was on his way marching through Mesopotamia and Cappadocia. Antigonus was obliged to recal
2 CONC l Demetrius from Greece, where his son had recently had a sterile encounter with Cassander in Thessaly; the two men, and their army, then moved against Lysimachus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However, the army of father and son was defeated by the united forces of Seleucus and Lysimachus at the decisive Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. Antigonus himself died in the battle after being struck b
2 CONC y a javelin, in the eighty-first year of his life. Prior to Ipsus, he had never before lost a battle.[contradiction] With his death, any plans the court of Antigonus may have had of reuniting Alexande
2 CONC r's empire came to an end. Antigonus's kingdom was divided up, with most ending up in the hands of new kingdoms under Lysimachus and Seleucus. The victors largely followed Antigonus's precedent and ha
2 CONC d themselves named as kings, but they did not claim power over the erstwhile empire of Alexander nor each other. Instead, these kings established a troubled (and in the end failed) modus vivendi with 
2 CONC each other, and accepted their kingdoms as separate realms.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Meanwhile, Antigonus's surviving son Demetrius took control of Macedon in 294 BC; Antigonus's descendants held this possession, off and on, until it was conquered by the Roman Republic at the Battl
2 CONC e of Pydna in 168 BC.</p>

2 CONT <p>Antigonus I MONOPHTHALMUS ("One-Eyed"), also called ANTIGONUS I CYCLOPS (b. 382 BC--d. 301, Ipsus, Phrygia, Asia Minor [now in Turkey]), Macedonian general under Alexander the Great who founded the
2 CONC  Macedonian dynasty of the Antigonids (306-168 BC), becoming king in 306. An exceptional strategist and combat leader, he was also an astute ruler who cultivated the friendship of Athens and other Gre
2 CONC ek city-states.
2 CONT <p>Military campaigns.</p>
2 CONT <p>In 333 Alexander had appointed Antigonus satrap of Phrygia, and upon Alexander's death he also received the governorship of Pamphylia and Lycia from the regent of the Macedonian empire, Perdiccas. 
2 CONC He then formed an alliance against Perdiccas with Antipater, the governor of Macedonia, and with Ptolemy of Egypt, Lysimachus of Thrace, and Craterus (all of whom had served under Alexander). Perdicca
2 CONC s was murdered, and Antipater became regent of the empire. In 321 Antipater appointed Antigonus commander in chief of his army in Asia and sent him against Eumenes, the satrap of Cappadocia and an adh
2 CONC erent of Perdiccas. Antigonus defeated Eumenes and then besieged him unsuccessfully in the mountain fortress Nora. Polyperchon succeeded Antipater as regent, and Antigonus joined forces against him wi
2 CONC th Cassander (Antipater's son), Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and Eumenes in 319. When Eumenes, his rival in Asia Minor (Anatolia), went over to Polyperchon, Antigonus defeated him with the aid of Seleucus and
2 CONC  Peithon (the satraps of Babylonia and Media, respectively) at Gabiene. Then, wishing to eliminate all possible rivals, Antigonus had both Eumenes and Peithon executed; Seleucus escaped to Egypt.
2 CONT <p>Antigonus was now in complete control of Asia Minor, but Ptolemy, Lysimachus, Cassander, and Seleucus allied themselves against him in the first coalition war (315-311) in an attempt to thwart his 
2 CONC plan of reuniting Alexander's empire. Antigonus occupied Syria and proclaimed himself regent. In order to win the support of the Greek city-states, whose resistance to subjugation presented the chief 
2 CONC stumbling block to the formation of a Hellenistic monarchy, he announced to his assembled army that all the Greeks should be free, autonomous, and ungarrisoned.This political slogan was to be sounded 
2 CONC again and again--almost immediately by Ptolemy and for a final time by the Romans in 196. With the aid of his officers in Greece, Antigonus drove out Cassander's Macedonian forces of occupation there 
2 CONC and formed the island cities in the Aegean into the League of the Islanders, preparatory to his invasion of Greece. His ally, the city of Rhodes, furnished him with the necessary fleet.
2 CONT <p>While he was engaged in conquering Caria, his son, Demetrius Poliorcetes, was defeated at Gaza by Ptolemy and Seleucus (312). Seleucus returned to his former province, Babylonia. In view of this ne
2 CONC w threat from the East, Antigonus decided to make peace with all of his adversaries except Seleucus. All of the diadochoi (Alexander's successors) confirmed the existing boundaries and the freedom of 
2 CONC the Greek cities. Antigonus, no longer regent but merely strategos (officer in charge) of the whole of Asia, was to rule in Syria and from the Hellespont to the Euphrates.
2 CONT <p>Activities in Greece.</p>
2 CONT <p>Then Ptolemy attacked Cilicia, and the second coalition war (310-301)against Antigonus broke out. In Greece in 307, Antigonus' son Demetrius ousted Demetrius of Phaleron, Cassander's governor of At
2 CONC hens, and reestablished the old Athenian constitution. The grateful Athenians honoured Antigonus and Demetrius as divine saviours (theoi soteres). Cassander's influence in Greece was now broken, and i
2 CONC n 306 Demetrius defeated Ptolemy's fleet near Salamis on the island of Cyprus and conqueredthe island. This victory gave Antigonus control of the Aegean, of theeastern Mediterranean, and of all of the
2 CONC  Near East except Babylonia. The assembled army proclaimed him king, and his friends adorned him with the diadem. For his part, he appointed Demetrius king and co-regentand sent him the diadem. This w
2 CONC as to become a traditional ceremony inthe Hellenistic monarchy.
2 CONT <p>In 305, after Antigonus had vainly attacked Egypt, Ptolemy also assumed the title of king, and Cassander, Lysimachus, and Seleucus followedsuit. The partition of Alexander's empire into five states
2 CONC  had now been formally established. In 305 Antigonus sent Demetrius to conquer Rhodes, which had refused him armed support against Ptolemy. After a year's unsuccessful siege he concluded a peace treat
2 CONC y and an alliance with the island state, guaranteeing it autonomy and neutrality in his conflicts with Ptolemy. This concession was necessary because in the meantime Cassander had invaded Attica and w
2 CONC as besieging Athens. Demetriusdrove him out of central Greece, and the Athenians bestowed on him a new religious honour, synnaos ("having the same temple") of the templeof the goddess Athena.
2 CONT <p>In 303 he occupied Corinth, Sicyon, and Argos in the Peloponnese, andAchaea, Elis, and almost all of Arcadia joined his side. In 302 Antigonus and Demetrius crowned their success by renewing the pa

2 CONT <p>Antigonus was now in complete control of Asia Minor, but Ptolemy, Lysimachus, Cassander, and Seleucus allied themselves against him in the first coalition war (315-311) in an attempt to thwart his 
2 CONC plan of reuniting Alexander's empire. Antigonus occupied Syria and proclaimed himself regent. In order to win the support of the Greek city-states, whose resistance to subjugation presented the chief

1 NOTE Antigonus I Monophthalmus
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus I Cyclops or Monophthalmus ("the One-eyed", so called from his having lost an eye) (382 BC - 301 BC) was a Macedonian nobleman, general, and satrap under Alexander the Great. He was a maj
2 CONC or figure in the Wars of the Diadochi after Alexander's death. He established the Antigonid dynasty and declared himself King in 306 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus was appointed governor of Greater Phrygia in 333 BC, and in the division of the provinces after Alexander's death in 323 BC he also received Pamphylia and Lycia from Perdiccas, regent of 
2 CONC the empire. He incurred the enmity of Perdiccas, the regent, by refusing to assist Eumenes to obtain possession of the provinces allotted to him. In danger of his life he escaped with his son Demetriu
2 CONC s into Greece, where he obtained the favour of Antipater, regent of Macedonia (321 BC). Soon after, on Perdiccas's death in 321 BC, a new division of empire took place. Antigonus found himself entrust
2 CONC ed with the command of the war against Eumenes, who had joined Perdiccas against the coalition of Antipater, Antigonus, Ptolemy, Craterus, and the other generals. Eumenes was defeated and forced to re
2 CONC tire to the fortress of Nora in Cappadocia, and a new army that was marching to his relief was routed by Antigonus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Polyperchon succeeded Antipater regent of the empire in 319 BC, to the exclusion of Cassander, his son. Antigonus resolved to set himself up as lord of all Asia, and in conjunction with Cassander a
2 CONC nd Ptolemy of Egypt, refused to recognize Polyperchon. He entered into negotiations with Eumenes; but Eumenes remained faithful to the royal house. Effecting his escape from Nora, he raised an army, a
2 CONC nd formed a coalition with the satraps of the eastern provinces. Antigonus fought against Eumenes two great battles at Paraitacene in 317 BC and Gabiene in 316 BC, following which Eumenes was at last 
2 CONC delivered up to Antigonus through treachery in Persia and put to death (316 BC).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antigonus again claimed authority over most Asia, seized the treasures at Susa and entered Babylon, of which Seleucus was governor. Seleucus fled to Ptolemy and entered into a league with him, Lysi
2 CONC machus and Cassander (315 BC) against Antigonus. In 314 BC Antigonus invaded Syria, under Ptolemy's control, and besieged Tyre for more than a year. His son Demetrius was defeated at the Battle of Gaz
2 CONC a by Ptolemy in 312 BC and lost Babylonia.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the war had been carried on with varying success from 315 to 311, peace was concluded, by which the government of Asia Minor and Syria was provisionally secured to Antigonus. This agreement w
2 CONC as soon violated on the pretext that garrisons had been placed in some of the free Greek cities by Antigonus, and Ptolemy and Cassander renewed hostilities against him. Demetrius Poliorcetes, the son 
2 CONC of Antigonus, wrested part of Greece from Cassander. At first Ptolemy had made a successful descent upon Asia Minor and on several of the islands of the Archipelago; but he was at length totally defea
2 CONC ted by Demetrius at the naval battle of Salamis.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Demetrius conquered Cyprus in 306 BC. Following the victory Antigonus assumed the title king and bestowed the same upon his son, a declaration that he was claiming to be Alexander's heir. He now pr
2 CONC epared a large army and a formidable fleet, the command of which he gave to Demetrius, and hastened to attack Ptolemy in his own dominions. His invasion of Egypt, however, proved a failure; he was una
2 CONC ble to penetrate Ptolemy's defences and was obliged to retire. Demetrius in 305 BC attempted the reduction of Rhodes, which had refused to assist Antigonus against Egypt. The siege of Rhodes lasted a 
2 CONC year and ended in 304 BC when Demetrius meeting with obstinate resistance, he was obliged to make a peace treaty upon the best terms that he could.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The most powerful satraps of the empire, Cassander, Seleucus, Ptolemy and Lysimachus, responded to Antigonus's assumption of the royal title by proclaiming themselves also kings. Antigonus soon fou
2 CONC nd himself at war with all four, largely because his territory shared borders with each of them. He demanded from Cassander the unconditional submission of Macedonia. Seleucus, Lysimachus and Ptolemy 
2 CONC joined forces and attacked him. He was obliged to recall Demetrius from Greece, although he was again winning success after success there, and moved against Lysimachus. The army of father and son was 
2 CONC defeated by the united forces of Seleucus and Lysimachus at the decisive Ipsus in 301 BC. Antigonus himself died in the battle after being struck by a javelin, in the eighty-first year of his age. Pri
2 CONC or to Ipsus, he had never before had lost a battle. With his death any plans he may have had of reuniting Alexander's Empire came to an end. The victors did not claim power over each other, but instea
2 CONC d accepted their kingdoms as separate. Antigonus's kingdom was divided up, with most ending up in the hands of Lysimachus and Seleucus.

2 CONT <p>Antipater (Greek: Ἀντίπατρος Antipatros; ca. 397 BC — 319 BC) was a Macedonian general and a supporter of kings Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great. In 320 BC, he became regen

2 CONT <p>Antipater (c. 399-319 B.C.) was an advisor of Alexander and commander of Alexander's European forces who served as regent from 334-323 B.C.</p>

2 CONT <p>Antipater and Parmenion were instrumental in making Alexander leader of the Macedonians after his father Philip died.</p>

2 CONT <p>Antipater and Alexander's mother Olympias quarreled, as a result of which Olympias wrote repeatedly to Alexander. Eventually, in 324, Alexander ordered Antipater to Babylon, but he was unable to co

2 CONT <p>Antipater (/ænˈtɪpətər/; Greek: Ἀντίπατρος Antipatros; c. 397 BC-319 BC) was a Macedonian general and a supporter of kings Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great. In 320 BC, h
2 CONC e became regent of all of Alexander's Empire.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Career under Philip and Alexander'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nothing is known of his early career until 342 BC, when he was appointed by Philip to govern Macedon as his regent while the former left for three years of hard and successful campaigning against T
2 CONC hracian and Scythians tribes, which extended Macedonian rule as far as the Hellespont. In 342 BC, when the Athenians tried to assume control of the Euboean towns and expel the pro-Macedonian rulers, h
2 CONC e sent Macedonian troops to stop them. In the autumn of the same year, Antipater went to Delphi, as Philip's representative in the Amphictyonic League, a religious organization to which Macedon had be
2 CONC en admitted in 346 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After the triumphal Macedonian victory at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, Antipater was sent as ambassador to Athens (337–336 BC) to negotiate a peace treaty and return the bones of the Atheni
2 CONC ans who had fallen in the battle.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He started as a great friend to both the young Alexander and the boy's mother, Olympias; there were even rumours that he was Alexander's father. He aided Alexander in the struggle to secure his suc
2 CONC cession after Philip's death, in 336 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>He joined Parmenion in advising Alexander the Great not to set out on his Asiatic expedition until he had provided by marriage for the succession to the throne. On the king's departure in 334 BC, h
2 CONC e was left regent in Macedonia and made "general (strategos) of Europe", positions he held until 323 BC. The European front was to prove initially quite agitated, and Antipater also had to send reinfo
2 CONC rcements to the king, as he did while the king was at Gordium in the winter of 334–333 BC.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Persian fleet under Memnon of Rhodes and Pharnabazus was apparently a considerable danger for Antipater, bringing war in the Aegean sea and threatening war in Europe. Luckily for the regent, Me
2 CONC mnon died during the siege of Mytilene on the isle of Lesbos and the remaining fleet dispersed in 333 BC, after Alexander's victory at the Battle of Issus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>More dangerous enemies were nearer home; tribes in Thrace rebelled in 332 BC, led by Memnon of Thrace, the Macedonian governor of the region, followed shortly by the revolt of Agis III, king of Spa
2 CONC rta.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Spartans, who were not members of the League of Corinth and had not participated in Alexander's expedition, saw in the Asian campaign the long-awaited chance to take back control over the Pelop
2 CONC onnese after the disastrous defeats at the Battle of Leuctra and Battle of Mantinea. The Persians generously funded Sparta's ambitions, making possible the formation of an army 20,000 strong. After as
2 CONC suming virtual control of Crete, Agis tried to build an anti-Macedonian front. While Athens remained neutral, the Achaeans, Arcadians and Elis became his allies, with the important exception of Megalo
2 CONC polis, the staunchly anti-Spartan capital of Arcadia. Agis started in 331 BC to besiege the city with his entire army, generating great alarm in Macedon.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>So to not have two enemies simultaneously, Antipater pardoned Memnon and even let him keep his office in Thrace, while great sums of money were sent him by Alexander. This helped to create, with Th
2 CONC essalian help and many mercenaries, a force double that of Agis, which Antipater in person led south in 330 BC to confront the Spartans. In the spring of that year, the two armies clashed near Megalop
2 CONC olis. Agis fell with many of his best soldiers, but not without inflicting heavy losses on the Macedonians.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Utterly defeated, the Spartans sued for peace; the latter's answer was to negotiate directly with the League of Corinth, but the Spartan emissaries preferred to treat directly with Alexander, who i
2 CONC mposed on Sparta's allies a penalty of 120 talents and the entrance of Sparta in the league.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Alexander appears to have been quite jealous of Antipater's victory; according to Plutarch, the king wrote in a letter to his viceroy: "It seems, my friends that while we have been conquering Dariu
2 CONC s here, there has been a battle of mice in Arcadia".
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antipater was disliked for supporting oligarchs and tyrants in Greece, but he also worked with the League of Corinth, built by Philip. In addition, his previously close relationship with the ambiti
2 CONC ous Olympias greatly deteriorated. Whether from jealousy or from the necessity of guarding against the evil consequences of the dissension between Olympias and Antipater, in 324 BC, Alexander ordered 
2 CONC the latter to lead fresh troops into Asia, while Craterus, in charge of discharged veterans returning home, was appointed to take over the regency in Macedon. When Alexander suddenly died in Babylon i
2 CONC n 323 BC however, Antipater was able to forestall the transfer of power.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''The fight for succession'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The new regent, Perdiccas, left Antipater in control of Greece. Antipater faced revolts in Athens, Aetolia, and Thessaly that made up the Lamian War, in which southern Greeks attempted to re-assert
2 CONC  their independence. He defeated them at the Battle of Crannon in 322 BC, with Craterus' help, and broke up the rebellion. As part of this he imposed oligarchy upon Athens and demanded the surrender o
2 CONC f Demosthenes, who committed suicide to escape capture. Later in the same year Antipater and Craterus were engaged in a war against the Aetolians when he received the news from Antigonus in Asia Minor
2 CONC  that Perdiccas contemplated making himself outright ruler of the empire. Antipater and Craterus accordingly conclude peace with the Aetolians and went to war against Perdiccas, allying themselves wit
2 CONC h Ptolemy, the satrap of Egypt. Antipater crossed over to Asia in 321 BC. While still in Syria, he received information that Perdiccas had been murdered by his own soldiers. Craterus fell in battle ag
2 CONC ainst Eumenes (Diodorus xviii. 25-39).
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Regent of the Empire'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In the treaty of Triparadisus (321 BC) Antipater participated in a new division of Alexander's great kingdom. He appointed himself supreme regent of all Alexander's empire and was left in control o
2 CONC f Greece as guardian of Alexander's son Alexander IV and his disabled brother Philip III. Having quelled a mutiny of his troops and commissioned Antigonus to continue the war against Eumenes and the o
2 CONC ther partisans of Perdiccas, Antipater returned to Macedonia, arriving there in 320 BC (Justin xiii. 6). Soon after, he was seized by an illness which terminated his active career, and died, leaving t
2 CONC he regency to the aged Polyperchon, passing over his son Cassander, a measure which gave rise to much confusion and ill-feeling.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Family'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antipater was one of the sons of a Macedonian nobleman called Iollas or Iolaus and his family were distant collateral relatives to the Argead dynasty. Antipater was originally from the Macedonian c
2 CONC ity of Paliura; had a brother called Cassander; was the paternal uncle of Cassander’s child Antigone and was the maternal great uncle of Berenice I of Egypt. Antipater had ten children from various 
2 CONC unknown wives. His daughters were: Phila, Eurydice of Egypt and Nicaea of Macedon, while his sons were: Iollas, Cassander, Pleistarchus, Phillip, Nicanor, Alexarchus and Triparadeisus.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>'''Literary works'''</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Antipater was a student of Aristotle and Aristotle named him as executor-in-charge of his will, when he died in 322 BC. According to Suidas, Antipater left a compilation of letters in 2 books and a
2 CONC  history, called The Illyrian Deeds of Perdikkas (Περδίκκου πράξεις Ιλλυριακαί).

2 CONT <p>Though the debate surrounding the cause of Alexander's sudden death has never been clearly resolved, all of our ancient sources—even those who reject the notion of murder and assign the death to 
2 CONC natural causes—mention that rumours abounded in the late fourth century BC that Antipater had been responsible for poisoning the great king. Shortly before Alexander's demise, Antipater's position h
2 CONC ad recently come under threat, as Alexander's mother Olympias had been writing to her son that Antipater was fomenting unrest and disloyalty in Macedon. Alexander had summoned him to Babylon to answer
2 CONC  these charges, but, citing his fear of an uprising in Greece, he had sent his son Cassander in his place. Cassander—so the rumour goes—then had his younger brother Iollas, Alexander's butler, poi
2 CONC son the king. Plutarch, who does not believe that Alexander was murdered, cites as the authority behind these rumours one Hagnothemis, who overheard Antigonus discuss the matter.

2 CONT <p>'''Lucius Caecilius Metellus Denter''' was consul in 284 BC, and praetor the year after. In this capacity he fell in the war against the Senones, and was succeeded by Manius Curius Dentatus.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Fischer, in his ''Römische Zeittafeln'', makes him praetor and die in 285 BC, and in the year following he has him again as consul. Drumann denies the identity of the consul and the praetor, on th

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} Archelaus was a son of Perdiccas II by a slave woman. He obtained the throne by murdering his own uncle Alcetas II and cousin Alexander, such that his father became king, and his half-
2 CONC brother, a child of seven years, the legitimate heir.[2] Almost immediately after he took power, Archelaus was faced with a situation which allowed him to completely reverse Macedon's relationship wit
2 CONC h Athens, which had been a major threat for the past half century. The Athenians experienced a crushing defeat at Syracuse in late 413 during which most of their ships were destroyed. This left the At
2 CONC henians in desperate need of a huge amount of timber to build new ships and Archelaus in a position to set the price. Archelaus generously supplied the Athenians with the timber they needed. In recogn
2 CONC ition of this, the Athenians honored Archelaus and his children with the titles of proxenos and euergetes.[3] Archelaus went on to institute many internal reforms. He issued an abundance of good quali

2 CONC as also known as a man of culture and extended cultural and artistic contacts with southern Greece. In his new palace at Pella (where he moved the capital from the old capital at Aigai), he hosted gre
2 CONC at poets, tragedians, including Agathon and Euripides (who wrote his tragedies Archelaus and The Bacchae while in Macedon), musicians, and painters, including Zeuxis (the most celebrated painter of hi
2 CONC s time).[4] Archelaus reorganized the Olympia, a religious festival with musical and athletic competitions honoring Olympian Zeus and the Muses at Dion, the Olympia of Macedon. The greatest athletes a
2 CONC nd artists of Greece came to Macedon to participate in this event. In addition, Archelaus competed and won in Tethrippon in both Olympic and Pythian Games.[5] According to Aelian, Archelaus was killed
2 CONC  in 399 BC during a hunt, by one of the royal pages, Crateuas.[6] According to Constantine Paparrigopoulos,[7] there were three accomplices: two Thessalians (Crateuas and Ellanokratis) and one Macedon
2 CONC ian, Decamnichos. The latter used to be Archelaus' protégé. However Decamnichos once insulted, in front of Archelaus, the tragic poet Euripides for the smell of the poet's alleged bad breath. This o

2 CONC eatment and thus participated in the killing of his king a few years later. Other versions of the king's death are reported by differing sources. Archelaus had several daughters and sons, including Or

1 NOTE Perdiccas II of Macedon
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Perdiccas II (Greek: ?e?d??a?) was king of Macedon ia from about 454 BC to about 413 BC. He was the son of Alexander I. After the death of Alexander in 452, Macedonia began to fall apart. Macedonia
2 CONC n tribes became almost completely autonomous, and were only loosely allied to the king. By 434, Perdiccas' brother, Philip, had challenged Pediccas for the throne, and enlisted the support of Athens a
2 CONC nd king Derdas of Elimea. Perdiccas responded by stirring up rebellion in a number of Athenian tribute cities, including Potidaea. Athens responded with force, and sent 1000 hoplites and 30 ships to M
2 CONC acedonia where they captured Therme. They went on to besiege Pydna, where they were met by reinforcements of a further 2000 hoplites and 40 ships. However, as the Athenians were besieging Pydna, they 
2 CONC received news that Corinth had sent a force of 1600 hoplites and 400 light troops to support Poteidaia. In order to combat this new threat, Athens made an alliance with Perdiccas, and proceeded to Pot
2 CONC eidaia. Perdiccas immediately broke the treaty and marched to Poteidaia, where the Athenians were victorious.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 431, Athens entered into an alliance with King Sitalkes of Thrace, after Nymphodorus, an Athenian, married Sitalkes’ sister. Nymphodorus then negotiated an agreement between Athens and Perdicc
2 CONC as, where Perdiccas regained Therme. As a result of this, Athens withdrew her support for Philip, and the Thracians promised to assist Perdiccas in capturing him. In return, Perdiccas marched on the C
2 CONC halcidians, the people he had originally persuaded to revolt.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>However, Perdiccas once again betrayed the Athenians and sent 1000 troops to support a Spartan assault on Acarnania in 429 but they arrived too late to help (Thucydides 2.80). In response to this, 
2 CONC Sitalkes invaded Macedonia with the promise of support from Athens. This support never materialized, and Perdiccas once again used diplomacy to ensure the survival of Macedonia. He promised the hand o
2 CONC f his sister in marriage to the nephew of Sitalkes, who then persuaded Sitalkes to leave.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>After this altercation, Perdiccas was allied to the Spartans and, in 424, helped the Spartan Brasidas to take Amphipolis from the Athenians, one of her most important colonies, mainly for its ready
2 CONC  access to timber for her fleets. This was a severe blow to Athens, and would tie them to Macedonian timber for years to come, which strengthened Macedonia’s bargaining power considerably. In return
2 CONC  for this, the Spartans helped Perdiccas secure his borders, by leading an assault on king Arrhabaeus of Lyncus, with the promise of support from the Illyrians. However, the Illyrians switched sides a
2 CONC nd attacked Perdiccas and his Spartan allies. The poorly trained Macedonian troops fled, and so the Spartans also retreated and attacked the Macedonian baggage train in anger. This soured relations be
2 CONC tween Macedonia and the Peloponnese for years to come, and pushed Perdiccas closer to Athens, allying himself with them in 423/2.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>By 417, Perdiccas had left the Athenians and joined the Spartan-Argive alliance. Just four years later, bowing to Athenian pressure, Perdiccas broke with the Peloponnese, and aided Athens in their 
2 CONC attack on Amphipolis.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 413 BC he died and left his son Archelaus as king.</p>

1 NOTE Alexander I of Macedon
2 CONT <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Alexander I (Greek: ????a?d??? ? ?a?ed??) was ruler of Macedon from 498 BC to 454 BC. He was the son of Amyntas I of Macedon.</p>
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>According to Herodotus he was unfriendly to Persia, and had the envoys of Darius I killed when they arrived at the court of his father during the Ionian Revolt. However, he was forced to submit to 
2 CONC Persia during the invasion of Greece by Darius' son Xerxes I, and he acted as a representative of the Persian governor Mardonius during peace negotiations after the Persian defeat at the Battle of Sal
2 CONC amis in 480 BC. Despite his cooperation with Persia, he frequently gave supplies and advice to the Greeks, and warned them of Mardonius' plans before the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC. Alexander eventua
2 CONC lly regained Macedonia's independence after the end of the Persian Wars.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Although Macedon was considered a semi-barbaric state by some Greeks (especially those whose colonies near Macedonia were threatened by Macedonian expansion), Alexander claimed descent from Argive 
2 CONC Greeks and Hercules. After a court of hellanodikai determined his claim to be true, he was permitted to participate in the Olympic Games, an honor reserved only for Greeks. He modeled his court after 
2 CONC Athens and was a patron of the poet Pindar.
2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>In 450 he was succeeded by his son Perdiccas II.</p>
2 CONT <p>Preceded by:</p>
2 CONT <p>Amyntas I King of Macedon</p>

1 NOTE {geni:about_me} In Roman mythology '''Iulus''' is the semi-divine ancestor of ￼[https://www.geni.com/projects/Gens-Iulia/916 gens￼ Iulia], a patrician family at Rome. Legends vary. Iulus was ident

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>The Iulii were undoubtedly of Alban origin. They were mentioned as one of the leading Alban families removed to Rome and enrolled among the ￼''patres''￼ there by Tullus Hostilius after the dest

2 CONT <p></p>
2 CONT <p>Nevertheless, the Iulii were mentioned in Roman legend even before the destruction of Alba Longa. Proculus Julius is said to have announced the passing of Romulus to the Roman people. He had a visi
