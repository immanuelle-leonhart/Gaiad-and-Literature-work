In Sol's embrace, her daughters came to be,
From nebula, they formed a cosmic host.
Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars we see,
With Ceres too, they grace the starry coast.

Once cloaked in waters, Mercury did shine,
But as the Sun's fierce heat began to rise,
The liquid fled, his surface left benign,
A rocky orb now meets our seeking eyes.

When Venus, struck, began to backward spin,
Her fate was sealed, her path forever turned.
A world of heat and clouds that choke within,
Her beauty veiled by sulfur skies that burned.

Then Earth, fair Gaia, tells her vibrant tale,
From seas arose the life that graced her face.
With mountains high and skies where clouds set sail,
A cradle formed for life's enduring race.

Mars, brother Mars, once water flowed in streams,
His ruddy face now bears a dusty guise.
But as the years passed by, he lost his dreams,
His waters sunk beneath his crimson skies.

Then Ceres slept, her growth was slow to start,
A younger sister, late to join the dance.
Yet beauty dwells within her rocky heart,
A jewel set in space's vast expanse.

The giants vast, the gaseous daughters four,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune's reign.
Their tales entwined within the cosmic lore,
With storms that swirl and moons in endless chain.

Around great Jupiter, his moons revolve,
Io, Europa, Ganymede, they dance.
Their icy secrets waiting to evolve,
A celestial show in night's expanse.

But Io's fires within her heart did glow,
Her waters boiled beneath volcanic flame.
Though some remained in hidden depths below,
A testament to change, she stays the same.

In Saturn's grasp, her moons of ice reside,
Enceladus and Titan lead the way.
A frozen kin around their mother glide,
In cosmic dance, their fates in balance sway.

Beyond cold Neptune lies a distant field,
Trans-Neptunian worlds in darkness hide.
Their icy secrets yet remain concealed,
A frigid tale where mysteries abide.

Farther still, the Oort Cloud wraps around,
A veil of frozen whispers far from light.
In distant orbits, comets there abound,
A cosmic dance that fades beyond our sight.
