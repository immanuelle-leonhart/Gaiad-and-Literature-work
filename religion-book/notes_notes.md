# Notes

Over the 20th century many Buddhist intellectuals in China, Japan, Korea and India explicitly sought to align Buddhist and Marxist worldviews. For example, James Shields highlights that early-20th-century Asian Buddhists tried to reconcile Buddhist “awakening” with Marxist “liberation,” examining terms like alienation and materialism in Buddhist context.[^cite_1](^cite_1)

In India, Marxist thinkers such as Rahul Sankrityayan (1893–1963) openly aimed for a “creative synthesis” of Buddhist and Marxist philosophy.[^cite_2](^cite_2)

Sankrityayan’s 1970 collection *Buddhism: The Marxist Approach* even includes a chapter titled “Buddhist Dialectics”.[^cite_3](^cite_3)

B.R. Ambedkar’s Navayāna Buddhism likewise proclaimed a congruence of Buddhist ethics and socialism, famously urging that liberty and fraternity must accompany equality.[^cite_4](^cite_4)

**Lin Qiuwu and Chinese/Taiwanese Buddhism:** A striking case is Lin Qiuwu (林求武, 1897–1963), who recast Buddhism as a rational philosophy suited to social reform.[^cite_5](^cite_5) In articles like “Class Struggle and Buddhism,” he fused Tiantai (Tendai) and Huayan (Kegon) metaphysics with Marxist class analysis. Lin drew on the Tiantai idea of a single “Absolute Mind” or Middle-Way Buddha-Nature uniting all phenomena,[^cite_6](^cite_6) and on Huayan’s motto *shi shi wu ai* (no-obstruction among all dharmas) to stress that every element is interconnected.[^cite_7](^cite_7) Framing this “unitive vision” through his term “one buddha” (yi fo), Lin argued that individual and cosmic bodies form a single great Buddha-body.[^cite_8](^cite_8) From this perspective class divisions arise only from the false view of a separate self: once people realize the “non-duality of mind, buddha, and sentient beings,” greed and class conflict disappear.[^cite_9](^cite_9) As Lin put it, the Buddhist attitude to class struggle is to “stand within the no-self that is also the Great Self” and cherish the propertyless masses.[^cite_10](^cite_10) In short, Lin saw Marxist revolution as a secular “Pure Land” project: awakening to Buddha-nature would naturally wither away classes without coercion.[^cite_11](^cite_11)[^cite_12](^cite_12)

**Japanese Tendai/Nichiren Movements:** In Japan, the *Shinkō Bukkyō* (New Buddhist) youth movements of the 1930s tried similar syntheses. Notably Seno’o Girō (妹尾義郎, 1890–1961), a Nichiren (Tendai-lineage) priest, combined Lotus-Sutra ideas with Marxism. Seno’o co-founded the “League for Revitalizing Buddhism” and later renounced sectarian Buddhism to address capitalism. He explicitly called for abolishing both the Buddhist sects and the capitalist system, advocating a new society of “common property and common prosperity”.[^cite_13](^cite_13) In his 1930s essays Seno’o critiqued “moral Marxism” for ignoring religion, but also rejected purely spiritual responses, insisting that material well-being go hand-in-hand with realizing emptiness and selflessness.[^cite_14](^cite_14)[^cite_15](^cite_15) (His execution in 1961 made him a Buddhist martyr of socialist ideals.)

**Korean Minjung Buddhism:** During the 1970s–80s pro-democracy movement, Minjung Buddhists (often influenced by Ch’ŏnt’ae/Tendai) forged a Marxist-inflected Buddhist discourse. As one account notes, they “derived their theoretical framework from Buddhist philosophy, adapted via Marxist theory,” searching for Buddhist doctrines that echoed Marxist egalitarianism.[^cite_16](^cite_16) They pointed out parallels: both early Buddhism and Marxism emphasize atheism, material conditions, empiricism and communal equality.[^cite_17](^cite_17) Fundamental Mahayana concepts were reinterpreted in class terms. For instance, dependent arising was seen as showing history woven from countless lives, justifying social engagement.[^cite_18](^cite_18) The idea of karma became human action (and dialectical “motion”) shaping history: Minjung thinkers even equated Marx’s principle of continual change with the karmic cycle.[^cite_19](^cite_19) Ultimately they redefined the Pure Land ideal: instead of a distant afterlife, it was a communist society to be built “when we strive to overcome the contradictions of society.”[^cite_20](^cite_20)

**Indian Context (Mahayana):** Outside East Asia, some 20th-century Indian Buddhists also blended Marxist ideas. Rahul Sankrityayan, originally a Buddhist scholar, became a communist in the 1930s and explicitly sought a “synthesis of Buddhist & Marxist philosophy.”[^cite_21](^cite_21) His anthology *Buddhist Dialectics* (1970) is a rare example of published “Buddhist socialism.” (The Dalit leader B.R. Ambedkar similarly saw Buddhism’s emphasis on equality as compatible with socialist goals.[^cite_22](^cite_22))

**Modern Scholarship:** In recent decades a modest academic literature analyzes such syntheses. Charles Jones (2000) documents Lin Qiuwu’s thought;[^cite_23](^cite_23)[^cite_24](^cite_24) Karsten Struhl (2017) explicitly compares Buddhist and Marxist “noble truths,” arguing that overcoming suffering requires both extinguishing the ego and building a classless society.[^cite_25](^cite_25)[^cite_26](^cite_26) Struhl notes that “capitalism both feeds on and reinforces” the Buddhist “illusion of self” through exploitation,[^cite_27](^cite_27) implying that Buddhist renunciation and Marxist revolution can be mutually enlightening. James Shields (2022) surveys Chinese Buddhist socialism efforts and highlights similar parallels between Buddhist awakening and Marxist emancipation.[^cite_28](^cite_28) These works often conclude that Buddhism and Marxism can “mutually enrich” each other, with Marxism providing a social praxis to complement Buddhist ethics.[^cite_29](^cite_29)[^cite_30](^cite_30)

**Image: Huayan (Kegon) Buddhism’s Indra’s Net**, symbolizing universal interpenetration. Each jewel reflects all others—just as Lin Qiuwu noted that “each individual element within the great unity is intimately interconnected.” Contemporary writers observe that this holographic vision can encompass even capitalist society (“billboards and boardrooms”) within a single dialectical web.[^cite_31](^cite_31)

**Dialectical interdependence:** Huayan’s metaphors (Indra’s Net) and Tendai’s “One Mind” doctrines naturally resonate with Marx’s dialectical view that all things are connected and in flux. Early Buddhism’s *pratītya-samutpāda* (dependent arising) functions as a “tapestry woven from the threads of individual lives,” analogous to Marx’s totalizing historical dialectic.[^cite_32](^cite_32)[^cite_33](^cite_33)

**Emptiness and class:** Buddhist *anattā* (no‐self) or emptiness was read as critiquing individualism and private ownership. Modern analysts similarly see capitalism as feeding “the greed and possessiveness which, for Buddhism, is rooted in the illusion of self.” Thus “extinguishing the illusion of self” is paralleled by abolishing class divisions: both are conditions for ending dukkha.[^cite_34](^cite_34)[^cite_35](^cite_35)

**Non-duality and Buddha-nature:** The Mahayana idea that Buddhahood is latent in all beings (Tiantai’s “Middle-Way Buddha-Nature”) was used to argue that workers and capitalists alike share a common reality. Lin’s “one buddha” concept posited a single life or being behind all phenomena. This non-dual vision suggests a fundamental equality of all things—an idea compatible with Marxist calls for an egalitarian society.[^cite_36](^cite_36)

In sum, from Lin Qiuwu’s 1930s essays to contemporary studies, Mahayana metaphysics (interdependence, non-duality, no-self, Buddha-nature) is treated as complementary to Marxist critique, while Marxism provides a practical framework for Buddhism’s ethical goals.
