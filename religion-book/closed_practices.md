# Closed practices

## Introduction
The term **“closed practice”** has gained prominence in recent years, especially within neo-pagan, witchcraft, and online spiritual communities. In broad terms, a closed practice refers to a **religious or ritual practice that is restricted** – typically to members of a particular culture, community, or lineage – and **not freely open to everyone**. As one pagan writer succinctly explains: *“Closed practices are those that you can only be a part of if you were born into the community, or if you have been initiated into it.”* [^cite_1](^cite_1) In other words, an “open” practice is accessible to anyone, while a “closed” practice requires some form of **insider status**, whether by birth, heritage, or formal initiation[^cite_2](^cite_2). This concept has become central in discussions of **cultural appropriation** and respect for boundaries in spirituality. It is especially emphasized in online spaces (Tumblr blogs, Discord groups, Reddit forums) where modern pagans and witches deliberate what practices outsiders should *not* partake in.

Importantly, the idea of closed practices is **not an entirely new phenomenon**. Many religions throughout history have drawn lines around who may participate in certain rituals or access certain knowledge. However, the *language* of “open vs. closed practice” – and the specific concerns about cultural theft or misuse – have emerged in particular force within **20th–21st century discourse**. This report examines the academic history and discussion of closed practices: from early critiques of “plastic shamans” in the 1970s–80s, through the term’s origin in neo-pagan communities, to contemporary online debates and scholarly analyses. We will also highlight well-documented examples of restricted rituals in world religions (such as Catholic sacraments, initiation rites, or lineage-based esoteric knowledge) to see how they compare to the modern label of a “closed practice.” Throughout, the focus will be on **academic and anthropological perspectives** – how scholars of religion, anthropology, and philosophy have articulated or critiqued the notion of closed practices – rather than on purely informal debate.

## Historical Origins: From “Plastic Shamans” to Cultural Protection
Issues of outsiders appropriating sacred traditions were already a point of contention by the late 20th century. In the 1970s and 1980s, as New Age spirituality and neo-shamanism grew in popularity, Native American communities began **speaking out against the misuse of their ceremonies**. Activists coined the term **“plastic shaman”** to denounce non-Native gurus and authors who profited from imitations of Indigenous rituals<ref name=":0">https://web.mnstate.edu/robertsb/380/plastic%20shamans%20and%20astroturf%20sun%20dances.pdf#:~:text=plastic%20medicine%20men%20for%20hire,Bake%20Shamans%2C%E2%80%9D%20as%20some%20Na%02tive</ref>. For example, anthropologist Lisa Aldred noted in 2000 that *“Euro-Americans professing to be medicine people have profited from publications and workshops”* selling purported Native wisdom<ref name=":0" />. By the late 1980s, Native activists were directly confronting these exploiters: the American Indian Movement (AIM) even disrupted “plastic medicine men” workshops and publicly **condemned those who profited from Native ceremonies<ref name=":0" />**. A famous statement from a 1993 gathering of Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota leaders – *“A Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality”* – declared *“war against all persons who persist in exploiting, abusing, and misrepresenting the sacred traditions and spiritual practices”* of Indigenous peoples<ref name=":0" />[^cite_3](^cite_3). This strong language underscored that certain rituals (e.g. the Lakota Sun Dance or sacred pipe ceremonies) were **not meant for outsiders**, especially not for commercial gain.

Such activism laid an important foundation for the **ethic of closed practices**. The message was that Indigenous spiritual knowledge is *not open-access* and that unauthorized use by outsiders is a form of harm or **colonial theft**. Anthropologists and scholars took note of these developments. Aldred, for instance, described how New Age appropriation amounts to a *“commercialization of Native American spirituality”* and how Indigenous peoples’ objections were rooted in the feeling that their sacred traditions were being degraded and **exploited by those with no real authority** (00-N1644-FM) (00-N1644-FM). In effect, Native critics were asserting that these ceremonies are *closed* – to be conducted only by those within the culture or by persons explicitly sanctioned. This early discourse did not yet use the term “closed practice,” but it articulated the **core principle**: *not everything is free for outsiders to take*. As one commentator later summarized, *“everything is not open property just because we wish it to be so… everything is not ours to take, everything is not ours to sell”*<ref name=":1">https://wildhunt.org/2014/11/culture-and-community-appropriation-exchange-and-modern-paganism.html#:~:text=that%20reminds%20us%20that%20everything,treasures%20are%20taken%20from%20a</ref>.

These debates in the 1970s–90s predominantly involved **Indigenous and New Age contexts**, but they influenced neo-pagan communities as well. Many neo-pagans in the 1960s–80s had freely borrowed from a variety of global traditions in forming new Witchcraft and Pagan practices. For example, modern Wicca – founded by Gerald Gardner mid-20th century – cobbled together elements from ceremonial magic, folk practices, Eastern philosophy, and even Indigenous lore (Mystic Magic: Closed Practices). By the 1980s, prominent Pagan authors like Starhawk and others were incorporating Native American terms (such as “smudging” with sage) or aspects of Afro-Caribbean religions into eclectic Witchcraft manuals. At the time, this syncretism was often seen as positive and creative. However, as **post-colonial awareness grew**, some pagans began to question whether *borrowing could become stealing*. The late 1980s and early 90s saw pagan writers start to acknowledge cultural appropriation as a problem. For instance, at the 1993 Parliament of the World’s Religions, Indigenous representatives forcefully criticized New Age and Pagan appropriations of their rites. This created a ripple effect: **respect for closed traditions** slowly entered the ethics of Pagan circles. By the mid-1990s, certain practices (like the sweat lodge, vision quest, or use of specific sacred herbs) were increasingly understood by Pagans to be **off-limits unless one had proper permission or training**. In essence, the concept of “closed practice” was germinating – even if it wasn’t yet called that – through these early cultural appropriation debates.

## Emergence of the Term in Neo-Pagan Communities
Within neo-pagan and witchcraft communities, the explicit terminology of **“closed” vs. “open” practices** seems to have crystallized in the 2000s and 2010s. Scholars note that by the 2010s, discussions of cultural appropriation had become *“a central topic in the witch and neopagan community”*, especially online (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). An important study by Kathryn Gottlieb (2017) traced how this discourse evolved on the blogging platform Tumblr, which in the 2010s hosted a vibrant “witchblr” subculture. Gottlieb explains that neo-pagans began distinguishing **open religions** (those *“available to everyone who wishes to practice them”*) from **closed religions** (those in which *“one must be born or initiated”* to participate) ([PDF](PDF) Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). In practice, community members were creating **informal lists** of which spiritual traditions or rituals were considered closed. A Reddit user’s explanation captures the emerging consensus: *“A closed practice is any practice that requires some type of initiation to take part in. A well-known example would be Catholic communion – you must be baptized (initiated) to receive it.”* (Which pagan practices are closed? - Reddit). While people often cite indigenous and magical traditions, this user’s example shows they were also framing even Christian sacraments in terms of “closed” access. The vocabulary of *closed/open practice* thus provided a new, simple heuristic: **open = free for all; closed = requires invitation, initiation, or cultural belonging**.

Online neo-pagan forums in the 2010s frequently debated specific cases. For example, many agreed that **Native American spiritual ceremonies, Afro-Caribbean religions like Vodou and Santería, and Romani (Gypsy) folk practices** were closed practices not open to outsiders (Which pagan practices are closed? - Reddit). An editorial on decolonizing paganism gives typical reasoning: *Burning **white sage** and calling it “smudging” is closed to anyone who is not part of the Indigenous community* (Mystic Magic: Closed Practices). The same author notes that **Vodou** and other African-based traditions are also closed: *“Most of these practices are closed as well. To join Vodou, one must find a priest and commit to the practice. Like Kabbalah, it is not something that can just be [up casually](picked)”* (Mystic Magic: Closed Practices). Here we see two important factors that pagans consider: **ancestry** (being part of an indigenous community) and **initiation under elders** (finding a priest, being taught). If a person lacks those, the practice is deemed *“not for you.”* In line with this, many Tumblr posts admonished eclectic witches to **avoid appropriating closed practices** and to seek alternative, culturally appropriate substitutes. For instance, instead of smudging with white sage (a plant sacred to certain Native tribes), non-Native witches were encouraged to use other herbs for smoke cleansing, or simply refer to the act as generic **“cleansing”** rather than using the word “smudge” (Mystic Magic: Closed Practices). Terminology became a sensitive point: using the *correct names* and not claiming titles like “shaman” or “voodoo priest” without credentials was part of respecting closed traditions.

It’s noteworthy that **neo-paganism itself has both open and closed dimensions**. Some neopagan traditions are *initiatory* (for example, Gardnerian Wicca is famously **closed to non-initiates**, with secret rituals and oath-bound lore). Others are more open and eclectic. This internal reality may have primed pagans to understand the closed/open distinction. As one occultist pointed out, *“Gardnerian Wicca is a ‘closed’ practice – initiates only – … Buddhism was once initiates-only, as was early Christianity”* (Feel like I will never meet other practitioners who DON’T steal from closed practises and religions. : r/occult). In other words, exclusivity in spiritual practice has precedent. However, what is new is the *moral valuation* attached to it. In online pagan discourse, labeling something a **closed practice often carries a strong prescriptive tone**: outsiders *should not* partake, lest they commit cultural appropriation. This goes beyond simply “secret versus public” rites; it ties into **social justice** and anti-colonial ethics. One Tumblr user described the dynamic pointedly: *“If you are integrating cultural practices from natives who are **not open to sharing them** with outsiders… you are appropriating – that is why we are discussing this term.”* <ref name=":1" />. In short, neo-pagans on platforms like Tumblr, Reddit, and Discord came to see guarding closed practices as a way to **honor marginalized cultures** and prevent the “theft” of spiritual resources by those in the dominant culture <ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">http://animalarchaeology.com/2018/07/16/what-is-old-is-new-again-cultural-appropriation/#:~:text=However%2C%20this%20masks%20the%20negative,can%20recreate%20imperialistic%20power%20structures</ref>.

Over the last decade, numerous **online communities and resources sprung up to educate practitioners** on this subject. Guides and blog posts enumerate which deities, herbs, rituals or symbols are off-limits unless you belong to the originating culture. For example, the Tumblr blog *“hopeful spirits”* regularly reminds readers that **Gaelic polytheism is *not*** a closed practice – pushing back against a misconception that one must have Celtic blood to worship Irish gods. *“Gaelic polytheism is not a closed practice. You do not need to be from Ireland, Scotland, or Man or have any ‘Celtic blood’ to worship the Gods, Ancestors, and Spirits,”* one post states, adding that *“Anyone who tells you different is misinformed at best or probably a racist at worst.”* (hopeful spirits). This example highlights an important nuance: the closed practice discourse itself is **contested and policed within the community**. Some worry that calling a practice “closed” can slide into ethnic essentialism (e.g. saying only people of certain ancestry can participate, which can sound like a “blood and soil” ideology). Thus, even as many neo-pagans embrace the closed/open framework, there are internal debates about **what falls where**. Which traditions are truly closed? Who has the authority to say so? These questions continue to be hashed out on forums and group chats. Indeed, some online groups have banned the topic altogether to avoid fights – on Reddit’s r/witchcraft, moderators discourage “gatekeeping” discussions and treat any publicly available information as fair game for learning (Feel like I will never meet other practitioners who DON’T steal from closed practises and religions. : r/occult). This underscores that “closed practice” is not a unanimously agreed doctrine, but rather a **living conversation** in the community.

## Examples of Closed Practices in Religious Traditions
To better grasp what “closed practice” means, it is useful to look at concrete examples of **restricted ritual or spiritual access** across various religions. Many mainstream religious traditions have long maintained certain *boundaries* around who may participate in what – though their logic may differ from the modern neo-pagan usage. These examples will illustrate how **diverse the forms of restriction** can be, and how they sometimes align with, or differ from, the contemporary label *“closed practice.”*

- **Catholic Sacraments (Closed Communion):** In Christianity, the idea of *“closed communion”* is centuries old. The Catholic Church, for instance, reserves the Eucharist (Holy Communion) for baptized Catholics in good standing. Non-Christians (and even Christians of other denominations) are not ordinarily permitted to receive the Eucharist at a Catholic Mass (Who Can Receive Holy Communion in the Catholic Church). As a Catholic explainer notes, *“Non-Christians cannot receive Communion because they have not received baptism, the gateway to the other sacraments.”* (Who Can Receive Holy Communion in the Catholic Church) This is a clear example of a **functional restriction** based on initiation – baptism is effectively an entry rite. Historically, the early Church was even more guarded: in antiquity, the unbaptized were literally ushered out of the church before the Eucharistic prayers began. The rationale here is theological (to protect the sanctity of the sacrament and ensure recipients understand its meaning) rather than stemming from cultural ownership. Anyone *may* become Catholic through conversion, and thereafter participate; thus the practice is closed in a **membership sense**, but not ethnically. This shows a key difference: “closed” in the context of a church means *“members only”*, whereas in neo-pagan cultural discourse, it often means *“outsiders can never truly become insiders,”* except perhaps by rare adoption or heritage.
- **Jewish Traditions and Kabbalah:** Some religions are *ethnically* inflected in their closed practices. Judaism does allow conversion, but it traditionally does not seek converts, and some esoteric aspects are discouraged for outsiders. For example, **Kabbalah**, the mystical tradition in Judaism, was historically restricted to learned Jewish practitioners (often males over 40 who had mastered Torah and Talmud). In neo-pagan circles, one often hears that *“Jewish witchcraft is closed; if you are not Jewish, you cannot use parts of Kabbalah.”* (Mystic Magic: Closed Practices) Indeed, Jewish voices have objected to non-Jews casually appropriating Kabbalistic symbols or rituals. The pop-occult “Kabbalah Center” (with celebrity non-Jewish followers) drew criticism from rabbis for this reason. Here we see a case where **lineage and religious identity blur** – Kabbalah is closed because it is deeply embedded in the Jewish faith and Hebrew language. Without that context, one is missing the necessary initiation (in this case, being part of the covenant of Judaism). This example aligns with the modern closed-practice concept: it’s about **cultural/religious ownership** of a practice (Jews for Kabbalah, in this framing). Notably though, Judaism does permit conversion; a converted Jew would be as Jewish as any other and could partake of Kabbalah study in traditional settings. Thus, from an academic view, we might say Kabbalah is *relatively* closed – requiring entry into the community first.
- **Initiation-Based Mystery Cults:** Throughout history, many societies have had **secret rites and mystery religions** that only initiates could attend. A famous example is the **Eleusinian Mysteries** of ancient Greece. These were sacred rituals in honor of Demeter and Persephone, celebrated for nearly 2000 years, in which participants had to undergo an initiation and oath of secrecy. The rites and knowledge revealed at Eleusis were *kept strictly secret* from the uninitiated public (Eleusinian Mysteries - Wikipedia) (Eleusinian Mysteries | Initiation, Rites & Cult - Britannica). Initiates from all over the Greek world (including women, men, free and enslaved persons of any ethnicity) could participate, but *only* if they underwent the prescribed initiation – and they were sworn not to reveal the Mysteries on pain of death. In modern terms, Eleusis was clearly a **closed practice**: one could not simply walk in and observe without being part of the initiated group, and its “membership” was defined by ritual initiation rather than by culture or lineage. Academically, such cults are often termed **“mystery religions”** or **“esoteric societies.”** They illustrate that long before the current debates, **religious secrecy and restricted access** were common. The purpose was often to safeguard sacred knowledge and enhance group bonds. Similarly, in the **Freemasonry** fraternity (originating in the 18th century but drawing on older secret society models), one must be initiated through degrees to learn the inner rituals. These forms of closed practice are based on **initiation and oath** as the gatekeeping mechanism – conceptually similar to how neo-pagans describe “must be initiated” for, say, Haitian Vodou or Wicca.
- **Lineage and Secret Societies in Indigenous Contexts:** Anthropological literature is rich with examples of **closed ceremonial societies** in Indigenous cultures worldwide. In parts of West and Central Africa, for instance, societies like the **Poro and Sande** (in Sierra Leone, Liberia, etc.) or the **Ogboni** (among the Yoruba of Nigeria) are closed fraternities with secret rites. Members undergo rigorous initiations, and there are often penalties – even death – for insiders who divulge secrets to outsiders (2.cdr) (2.cdr). Knowledge in these societies is tiered: initiates learn progressively deeper secrets, and the uninitiated are not allowed to witness certain ceremonies at all. In many Australian Aboriginal communities, there are “men’s business” and “women’s business” rituals that are strictly segregated; only initiated men can see certain sacred objects or art, for example. Outsiders to the culture are generally *never* permitted access to these secret traditions, and even uninitiated community members may be excluded until undergoing the proper rites. Anthropologists have had to tread carefully – early ethnographers who published secret details earned lasting distrust. These indigenous secret-cult examples highlight a form of closed practice grounded in **sacred secrecy and group identity**. Unlike the neo-pagan discourse (which often centers on preventing *cultural exploitation*), in these cases the concern is often **cosmic or social order** – i.e., that powerful ritual knowledge, if misused or revealed to the wrong people, could bring harm or lose its efficacy. Nonetheless, the net effect is similar: there are clear boundaries beyond which an outsider (or uninitiated person) *must not cross*. The modern language of “closed practice” can certainly describe these scenarios.
- **Initiatory African-Diaspora Religions:** Religions like **Haitian Vodou, Cuban Santería (Regla de Ocha), Candomblé, and Hoodoo/Rootwork** often come up in current debates. These traditions are rooted in specific ethnic and historical experiences (e.g. Vodou in the Haitian context of former enslaved Africans and Catholic influence). They typically have **formal initiation ceremonies (kanzo in Vodou, making Ocha in Santería, etc.)** which induct a person into the priesthood or society of the religion. Without initiation, one might attend public ceremonies or be a client, but one is not a full practitioner. Importantly, these traditions *do* accept sincere outsiders in many lineages – there are white and non-African-descended priests of Vodou and Santería, for example, who were properly initiated. However, from the perspective of an outsider looking in (and certainly from the perspective of *internet discourse*), Vodou and related faiths are considered **closed practices**. You cannot simply read a book and declare yourself a Vodou priest; you must go through the community’s own channels (Mystic Magic: Closed Practices). Practically, this is an initiation-based restriction akin to the Eleusinian example, but it’s also bound up with **cultural identity** (since these faiths carry the heritage of marginalized peoples). Scholars of religion point out that such traditions manage a **balance between openness and protection**: they often welcome *genuine seekers* who apprentice under a house and undergo the rites, but they strongly reject dilettantes or commercial exploiters. Indeed, the very term “**Hoodoo**” in African-American communities has an element of closed secrecy – for generations it was practiced quietly within black communities, and knowledge was passed down in families or mentor relationships, kept out of mainstream view. Today, one sees debates (especially on platforms like TikTok or Tumblr) about whether non-black practitioners can or should do Hoodoo; many black American practitioners assert it is a **closed practice belonging to African-American heritage**, cautioning outsiders against cherry-picking spells or sacred songs from it.
- **“Conversion-Restricted” Religions:** Some entire religions are traditionally *closed* in the sense that they do not accept converts or make it exceedingly difficult. For example, the **Parsi Zoroastrians** (Indian Zoroastrians descended from Persian immigrants) historically do not admit new converts – one must be born into a Zoroastrian family to be recognized. Similarly, certain Hindu temples or sects have rules barring non-Hindus from entering sacred precincts (e.g. the Jagannath Temple in Puri, India prohibits non-Hindus from entry). These cases are about **ethnic or hereditary criteria** for participation. They complicate the neat open/closed binary: Is Hindu worship “closed” or “open”? Hinduism as a whole has no conversion sacrament and is broad, but specific lineages and temple communities may be closed to outsiders. Anthropologist Michael Lambek and others have noted that some cultures conceive religion as an inalienable inheritance – *you can’t just adopt it at will*. This outlook resonates with the neo-pagan insistence that *certain practices belong to a people* and outsiders can’t just help themselves. However, it’s worth noting that many world religions have *opened up over time* – for instance, **Buddhism** in its early monastic form required joining the sangha (monastery) to fully practice, but today it is quite “open” globally with many non-Asian adherents (though even Buddhism retains esoteric initiations in Vajrayana/Tantric contexts).

In summary, examples across the world reveal *multiple dimensions* of why a practice might be closed: **sacred secrecy, initiation status, ethnic lineage, doctrinal purity, or cultural survival**. The modern label “closed practice” in online discourse tends to blur some of these distinctions, treating them all under one umbrella of “not for outsiders.” Scholars find this both useful and problematic – useful as a shorthand for talking about **power and permission** in spirituality, but potentially oversimplifying very different scenarios. The Catholic communion example, for instance, is often cited in pagan forums as a “closed practice” (Which pagan practices are closed? - Reddit), which is true in one sense, though the Church’s reasoning has nothing to do with cultural appropriation. Likewise, someone might argue that if *all* practices requiring initiation are “closed,” then even things like Reiki (which has attunements) or certain forms of Yoga could be considered closed. Clearly, context matters.

## Contemporary Online Discourse and Community Dynamics
The rise of social media platforms dedicated to witchcraft and paganism (Tumblr’s #witchblr, various Discord servers, subreddits like r/witchcraft and r/pagan) has amplified the discussion of closed practices. These online communities have become **key sites for both the promotion and the challenging of the concept**. Ethnographic studies and firsthand accounts indicate that newcomers often learn about closed practices through community guidelines and veteran members. In interviews conducted on the role of online communities for witches, participants noted encountering **strong moral norms** against appropriation. Some experienced users took it upon themselves to correct or even scold those seen using closed practices in ignorance (“In the broom closet”: exploring the role of online communities in shaping the identities of contemporary witchcraft practitioners | Current Psychology ) (“In the broom closet”: exploring the role of online communities in shaping the identities of contemporary witchcraft practitioners | Current Psychology ). For example, a new witch posting about burning sage might be met with comments explaining the Native context of smudging and suggesting alternative herbs. While this can be educational, researchers have observed it can also veer into **policing and gatekeeping** that *“was generally perceived as off-putting, particularly for those who were new to witchcraft.”* (“In the broom closet”: exploring the role of online communities in shaping the identities of contemporary witchcraft practitioners | Current Psychology ) The zeal to enforce respect for closed practices sometimes turns into what one study participant described as *“moral preaching”* that could alienate newcomers (“In the broom closet”: exploring the role of online communities in shaping the identities of contemporary witchcraft practitioners | Current Psychology ). In a 2022 study of online witch identities (Frampton & Grandison 2023), some interviewees reported witnessing “bullying of newly practicing witches” over issues like using the wrong terminology or inadvertently invoking a closed practice (“In the broom closet”: exploring the role of online communities in shaping the identities of contemporary witchcraft practitioners | Current Psychology ) (“In the broom closet”: exploring the role of online communities in shaping the identities of contemporary witchcraft practitioners | Current Psychology ). Moderators of groups often have to walk a fine line between **allowing discussion** of these issues and preventing flame wars.

There is also a generational or subcultural divide in attitudes. Broadly, the **Tumblr-born discourse** of closed practices has been championed by many younger or more socially progressive practitioners, whereas some older or more traditional occultists bristle at what they see as rigid rules. This tension is evident in online arguments. For instance, on Reddit’s r/occult, one user argued that *“most ‘closed practice’ claims are just veiled racism”* – an expression of frustration that the concept can become too tied to race and ancestry (Feel like I will never meet other practitioners who DON’T steal from closed practises and religions. : r/occult). He pointed out that historically, religions spread through contact and that *“clinging to long dead traditions”* and keeping them closed might not be practical or necessary (Feel like I will never meet other practitioners who DON’T steal from closed practises and religions. : r/occult). On the other hand, many practitioners of color and their allies emphasize that **power imbalances** in society make these boundaries necessary. A common refrain is that when a dominant-culture person takes on a minority’s sacred practice without permission, it *perpetuates the colonial pattern* of exploitation<ref name=":2" />. In one blog, this is phrased as *“an outsider... gains from their use of practices that are not rightfully theirs, which in effect can recreate imperialistic power structures”<ref name=":2" />*. Online community ethos often leans toward protecting those who have historically been disempowered in spiritual conversations.

Interestingly, some platforms have institutionalized positions on the matter. As noted, **Reddit’s r/witchcraft** decided to consider the sharing of any information that is publicly available (in books or online) as “open,” effectively disallowing users from trying to gatekeep others based on closed practice arguments (Feel like I will never meet other practitioners who DON’T steal from closed practises and religions. : r/occult). This policy was an attempt to reduce infighting. It suggests that while the majority acknowledges closed practices conceptually, *enforcing* that norm in a large, diverse online group can be contentious. Meanwhile, specialized groups – for example, a Discord server specifically for Afro-diasporic religions – may have strict rules reflecting closed status (e.g. only initiates can teach certain things, outsiders should ask permission to observe chats, etc.). Thus, online discourse is not monolithic; it is an evolving negotiation. Scholars following these trends sometimes liken it to earlier phenomena of **internet “flame wars” and norm formation**, but with a new dimension of social justice language.

Despite the debates, the closed practice concept has definitely *shaped behavior* in these communities. Many well-intentioned eclectic practitioners now carefully **vet their practices**: *Is this symbol from a culture I have no connection to?*, *Did I learn this chant from a closed tradition?*, *Do I have the right to use this deity’s name or should I seek a teacher first?* This self-scrutiny is a marked change from, say, the 1990s when a neo-pagan might cheerfully mix Navajo chant with Celtic rites without a second thought. One tangible outcome is the creation of **alternative rituals and vocabularies**, as mentioned earlier. A neopagan might opt for a **“land acknowledgment”** to honor Native peoples rather than appropriating a smudging ritual; or use the term “**smoke cleansing**” instead of “smudging” and choose local herbs to burn (Mystic Magic: Closed Practices). Another example is crafting new ceremonies inspired by indigenous ones but not copying them – e.g. doing a generic four-directions salute in a Wiccan circle, but *not* using the exact prayers of the Lakota Sun Dance. These adaptations are sometimes shared online as “**culturally respectful alternatives**.” Gottlieb’s research on Tumblr witches found that community members actively developed such alternatives and **“neutralization techniques”** – essentially justifications or modifications to avoid the stigma of appropriation (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). In her interviews, some pagans described feeling guilty when they discovered a practice they had been doing might be closed, and then taking steps to change their practice or seek proper permission.

## Scholarly Perspectives and Critiques
Academic engagement with the closed practice concept has grown in tandem with its spread in popular discourse. Scholars of contemporary religion, anthropology, and philosophy have approached the issue from several angles:

- **Understanding the Discourse:** Researchers have worked to document *how and why* the closed-practice idea took hold. Kathryn Gottlieb’s 2017 thesis (University of Maine) was an early scholarly work devoted to this, titled *“Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft.”* She examined **Tumblr discussions** and interviewed practitioners to understand the discourse’s impact (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). Her study situates the closed-practice debate in the broader history of modern witchcraft, noting that neopaganism’s eclectic roots were being re-evaluated through a lens of cultural sensitivity. She also noted the development of *“alternative terminologies”* (like saying *“cleansing”* instead of *“smudging”*) as the community’s response to recognizing a practice as closed (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). This indicates a conscious shift in the community’s identity – an example of what anthropologists call **reflexive self-regulation**: the community is modifying itself based on ethical reflections. Gottlieb’s work treats the topic seriously, validating that *this is a significant conversation that tells us about the evolution of modern Pagan values.*
- **Critical Theory and Power:** Scholars like Sabina Magliocco (a folklorist/anthropologist) and Amy Hale have discussed appropriation and closed practices in terms of **power dynamics and authenticity**. An important point made in academic circles is that cultural appropriation is *not equivalent to mere cultural exchange* – it crucially involves **exploitation and unequal power** (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium). As anthropologist Amy Hale puts it, *“Cultural appropriation is not the same as cultural borrowing. Appropriation involves exploitation and differentials in power relations.”* (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium) In other words, when a majority-culture person adopts a minority culture’s spiritual practice without permission, it’s qualitatively different from two cultures freely sharing with mutual respect. This theoretical framing supports why closed practices *should* be respected in many cases – to avoid reinforcing historic inequalities. Furthermore, some scholars tie this to the concept of **cultural heritage rights**. There is a growing recognition (even in international law, like UNESCO conventions and the U.N. Declaration on Indigenous Rights) that communities have a right to protect and control their intangible cultural heritage, including sacred rituals. The closed practice ethos can be seen as a grassroots reflection of that principle. It is a form of what some philosophers might call **“cultural privacy”** or **“epistemic self-determination”** – the idea that a culture can choose how and with whom its sacred knowledge is shared.
- **Critiques of Essentialism:** On the other hand, scholars have also critiqued the closed-practice discourse when it becomes too rigid or **essentialist**. Amy Hale, for example, while acknowledging the realities of appropriation, warns against an overly zealous focus on cultural purity. *“Cultural artifacts survive and thrive through transmission and contact,”* she notes, and it is acceptable for cultures to exchange in healthy ways (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium). Hale argues that demanding perfect purity of lineage for every practice is historically untenable – *“perfect unbroken transmission is nearly impossible to find with any cultural expression”* (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium). She cautions that *“focusing on cultural purity and origins leads to disappointment at best and Nazis at worst.”* (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium) This provocative statement highlights the danger of a “bloodline-based” approach: it can slide into the same kind of exclusivist thinking that extremist ethnonationalists use. In scholarly terms, Hale and others critique what they call **reification of culture** – treating cultures as sealed, static entities. Modern anthropological consensus is that cultures are dynamic, and syncretism (the blending of practices) has been a constant in religious history. Therefore, a blanket interdiction on participating in another culture’s practice might ignore contexts where sharing is welcomed or where identities are mixed. Anthropologist Sabina Magliocco has similarly noted that **too narrow a view of authenticity** can be problematic. She observed that some neo-pagans and indigenous groups form alliances and share practices in good faith, complicating the simple open/closed binary (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium). For instance, some Celtic Reconstructionist pagans have respectfully learned from living Celtic folk traditions – is that appropriation or just revival? The answer may depend on perspective.
- **Contested Boundaries – Academic Analysis:** A very recent scholarly contribution is a chapter by Apoorvaa Joshi and Ethel Brooks (2025) entitled *“Whose Craft?: Contentions on Open and Closed Practice in Contemporary Witchcraft(s)”*. This appears in *The Witch Studies Reader* (Duke University Press, 2025) and explicitly tackles the debates around open vs. closed practices. The authors describe **“contested boundaries”** in the witchcraft community, noting that *“one such boundary, and the focus of this chapter, is the discussion around ‘open’ and ‘closed’ practices.”* (Whose Craft?Contentions on Open and Closed Practice in ...). While we only have a preview of their work, it’s clear that academic interest has recognized this as a **hot-button issue that encapsulates deeper questions**: who “owns” spiritual knowledge? How do decolonial and feminist perspectives influence modern witchcraft? Preliminary information suggests Joshi and Brooks approach it from a **critical decolonial feminist perspective**, examining how debates on closed practice intersect with issues of race, colonial history, and the self-definition of witches outside Eurocentric narratives (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft) (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). The very title “Whose Craft?” signals the core question of ownership and belonging. Scholars like them likely argue that the closed-practice discourse is part of a larger **reckoning with colonialism in contemporary Paganism** – an effort to “decenter Europe,” uplift suppressed indigenous voices, and challenge the free-for-all universalist approach that older occultism sometimes took (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). At the same time, by calling them “contentions,” they acknowledge this is not settled; it’s an evolving negotiation of identity in modern witchcraft.
- **Ethical and Philosophical Debates:** Philosophers of religion and ethicists have also weighed in indirectly by discussing **cultural appropriation ethics**. One debate is how to balance *respect for closed practices* with the values of *individual spiritual freedom*. Western liberal thought generally supports the idea that individuals can explore any religion. Yet, the closed practice idea posits that moral constraints exist on that freedom out of respect for communities. This is a tension between **individualism and collective rights**. Some philosophers argue that if an outsider approaches a tradition humbly, learns the language, even converts or is initiated properly, then morally there is no issue – the practice is no longer “stolen” but rather **shared with consent**. Others note that power imbalances complicate the possibility of genuine consent (e.g., an economically pressured shaman might “share” sacred rituals for money, but is that true consent or coerced by circumstances?). In sum, academic discussions probe questions like: *Can spiritual knowledge be owned?* *Is restricting spiritual practices a form of necessary protection or a problematic gatekeeping?* These remain open questions with thoughtful arguments on both sides.
- **Lived Reality and Complexity:** Ethnographers who study particular communities often find that the reality of how practices are shared or closed is quite nuanced. For example, an anthropologist studying Haitian Vodou might find that *within Haiti*, Vodou priests are proud to initiate foreigners who show respect – hence from their perspective Vodou isn’t “closed” in a racial sense, though it *is* closed in that you must go through the proper initiation. Meanwhile, on the internet, one sees non-Haitians doing pseudo-Vodou spells without initiation – which *is* offensive to the community. Thus the issue is not that outsiders can *never* join, but that they must do so **on the community’s terms**. Scholars like Erin Taylor and Elizabeth Perez (who have studied Afro-Caribbean traditions) emphasize the importance of **relationship and permission**. A practice might be *conditionally open* – if you build a relationship with the culture, you may be welcomed – but it remains *closed to casual appropriation*. This nuance sometimes gets lost in heated online exchanges. Anthropologist Sabina Magliocco has observed that in some cases neo-pagans have responsibly engaged with indigenous teachers and received permission to adapt certain practices, muddying any simplistic categorization of that practice as strictly “closed” or “open.”

In conclusion, the academic framing of closed practices tends to support the **intent** behind the concept – protecting vulnerable cultures from exploitation – while also urging a **critical, nuanced approach**. Scholars often encourage moving beyond slogans to ask: *Who sets the boundaries? How do power and history play in?* They also draw parallels to similar concepts in other domains, such as intellectual property rights, secrecy in ritual, and cultural revival movements. There is a recognition that the closed-practice discourse is *part of a broader decolonization trend* in spirituality. As one commentator noted, the effort to avoid appropriation forces modern Pagans to learn more about the **“cultural & historical context”** of traditions, making them more educated and respectful practitioners overall (hopeful spirits) (hopeful spirits). This educational silver lining is something scholars praise – it pushes practitioners toward genuine intercultural understanding rather than shallow borrowing.

## Conclusion
The concept of “closed practices” in religion has evolved from a niche concern of indigenous activists into a wide-ranging discussion that engages neo-pagan communities, internet subcultures, and academic thinkers. Its **historical roots** lie in legitimate grievances over cultural exploitation – epitomized by the “plastic shaman” backlash and declarations by Native Americans to protect their sacred traditions. From there, neo-pagans (especially in the 2010s) adopted the terminology of *closed vs. open* practices as a way to navigate the ethics of borrowing in a post-colonial world. This framework has since permeated online discourse: on Tumblr dashboards and Discord chats, one finds young witches learning that some practices (like smudging, Hoodoo, or Kabbalah) are *“closed – not for outsiders”*. They also learn that other practices (like Celtic polytheism or Wicca) are more open, or that proper initiation can grant entry across the threshold.

Academically, this phenomenon has been met with both affirmation and critique. **Anthropologists and scholars of religion largely affirm the importance of respecting the wishes of source communities**, noting that cultural appropriation is harmful when it involves power imbalances and disrespect (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium) (Not For You: Cultural Appropriation in Neo-Paganism and How Archaeology Plays a Role – Animal Archaeology). At the same time, they caution against simplistic absolutism. Culture and religion are dynamic; one era’s closed practice may later spread legitimately through cross-cultural exchange (consider Buddhism’s travel from India across Asia, or Yoga’s global diffusion). The challenge, as scholars frame it, is to ensure **mutual respect and consent** guide any adoption of practices. As philosopher James O. Young wrote in a related context, the morality of using another culture’s art or rituals depends on factors like whether the source community consents or is harmed – not merely on the fact of cross-cultural use itself (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium) (On Paganism, Fakelore, and Tired Conversations about Authenticity | by Amy Hale | Medium).

From Catholic communion to Yoruba secret societies, we see that restricting spiritual practices is an age-old aspect of human societies – sometimes for internal theological reasons, sometimes as a shield against outside interference. The *modern notion* of a closed practice brings in an additional moral dimension: it asks, *“By partaking in this practice, am I violating someone’s cultural sovereignty or trust?”* This question has undoubtedly made modern Pagans more conscientious. It has sparked intense debates, but also deeper research and self-examination. **Functional restrictions** (like initiation requirements) and **cultural boundaries** (like ethnic lineage) both inform the label, and sometimes lead to overzealous claims (e.g. the erroneous idea that one needs “Celtic blood” to honor Celtic gods, rightly called out as misguided (hopeful spirits)). Yet at its best, the closed-practice discourse encourages a kind of **ethical spirituality** – one that strives to practice in a way that is both authentic to oneself *and* respectful toward the cultures one draws from.

In the online world, this discourse continues to develop. We now see community-generated lists of what’s closed, nuanced discussions about specific cases (e.g. *Is Reiki a closed practice since it was once secret in Japan?*; *Can non-Indigenous people participate in Ayahuasca ceremonies if invited?*; etc.), and even some fatigue and backlash in parts of the community. The push and pull will likely continue, but it has unquestionably altered the landscape of contemporary Pagan and New Age practice. A new practitioner in 2025 is far more likely to think twice about burning white sage or calling themselves a shaman than one in 1985 – a testament to the influence of this concept.

From an academic perspective, the conversation around closed practices is valuable because it forces recognition of **historical injustices and the need for cultural humility**. It also raises fascinating questions about the nature of tradition, ownership, and the transmission of knowledge. Scholars will undoubtedly keep studying online pagan forums and real-world communities to see how these ideas play out. As one recent volume on witchcraft studies put it, these debates are part of *“decentering Europe”* and challenging old paradigms in understanding witchcraft and religion (Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft). In plain terms, the closed practice concept is one way marginalized voices are asserting their agency in the spiritual realm – saying *“this is ours, handle with care.”*

Ultimately, most scholars and practitioners can agree on a middle ground principle: **context and respect are everything**. If a practice truly belongs to a living community that considers it closed, outsiders face an ethical mandate to honor that – whether that means abstaining or approaching through proper channels. Conversely, assuming every spiritual element is proprietary can lead to absurd or counterproductive outcomes. The key is ongoing dialogue, education, and empathy. The emergence of the closed practice concept, with all its contentions, has already prompted such dialogue on a wide scale – from academic conferences to coven meetings. It is an evolving example of how modern religious movements grapple with the legacy of colonialism and the meaning of authenticity in an interconnected world.
