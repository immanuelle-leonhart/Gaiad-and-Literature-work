# Chapter 15: Commodore Perry → Meiji State Shinto → 1945

*[NEEDS WRITING - COMPLETES JAPAN NARRATIVE]*

## Chapter Outline
- **Narrative continues from Chapter 10 cliffhanger**
- Meiji Department of Divinities revival
- Development through Japanese nationalism
- **1945 Shinto Directive**: Shinto forced into "religion" category
- Emperor renounces divinity, Japan becomes "secular"

*This resolves the cliffhanger and shows "religion" category being imposed*
