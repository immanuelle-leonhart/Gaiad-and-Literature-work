### **Chapter 12: Perry to 1945 - Completing the Japan Narrative**

**Status**: Placeholder only
**Target**: 8,000-10,000 words
**Priority**: HIGH (completes major narrative thread)

**Research Sources Needed**:
- **Meiji Restoration**: 1868 religious policy, Department of Divinities
- **State Shinto development**: Imperial ideology, shrine consolidation
- **Colonial period**: Taiwan, Korea, Manchuria religious policy
- **1945 Shinto Directive**: Occupation religious policy, democratization

**Key Arguments to Develop**:
1. **Narrative continuation** - resolving Chapter 11 cliffhanger
2. **Meiji religious policy** - state creation of "Shinto religion"
3. **Imperial expansion** - exporting State Shinto template
4. **1945 transformation** - forced secularization and "religion" categorization
5. **Occupation reforms** - American Protestant template imposed

**Writing Strategy**:
- **Opening**: "When Commodore Perry's black ships arrived..."
- **Meiji innovation**: Creating "Shinto" as state religion
- **Imperial period**: Religious nationalism and colonial export
- **Wartime intensification**: Total mobilization through religious nationalism
- **1945 collapse**: Occupation reforms forcing "religion" category

**Key Transition**: This resolves the anachronistic narrative device and shows "religion" category being globally imposed

### **Chapter 13: Cold War - Post-1945 Major Focus Begins**

**Status**: Placeholder only  
**Target**: 10,000-12,000 words

2. **Anti-communist mobilization** - religion weaponized for Cold War
3. **Right-wing conspiracy networks** - transnational religious-political alliances
4. **Segregation through religion** - white Christian nationalism emergence
5. **Church transformation** - from community centers to ego glorification + extremism selection

**Specific Research Targets**:

- **Family International** (The Family) global operations

**Status**: Placeholder only
**Target**: 6,000-8,000 words  
**Priority**: HIGH (brings argument together)
