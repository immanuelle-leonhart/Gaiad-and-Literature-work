# Chapter 7: The Great Awakening - Democratic Conversion and the Market of Sects

*[COMPREHENSIVE CHAPTER - American Religious Innovation]*

**"I preached as never sure to preach again, and as a dying man to dying men." —Richard Baxter's motto, adopted by Great Awakening preachers**

## Introduction: The Invention of Mass Religious Experience

Between 1730 and 1760, a series of religious revivals swept through colonial America, fundamentally transforming Protestant Christianity from a clerically-controlled, intellectually-oriented system into an emotionally-driven, democratically-accessible spiritual marketplace. The Great Awakening created the first **mass religious experience** designed for popular consumption, establishing techniques of emotional conversion that would become the template for American religious export worldwide.

This transformation represents a crucial development in our narrative: where the Protestant Reformation created "religion" as belief-centered practice, the Great Awakening created **religious choice** as emotional experience. It democratized religious authority, commercialized spiritual techniques, and established the competitive "market of sects" that becomes America's distinctive contribution to global religious forms.

We analyze this development through several lenses:
- **Foucault's disciplinary power** - mass revival as technique of social control
- **Weber's routinization of charisma** - from spontaneous awakening to organized evangelicalism  
- **Market revolution context** - religious competition paralleling economic competition
- **Democratic ideology** - spiritual equality reflecting political equality
- **Colonial export preparation** - techniques designed for cross-cultural transmission

## 1. Context: Post-Puritan Crisis and the Need for Revival

### 1.1 The Decline of Covenant Community

By 1700, New England Puritanism faced a crisis of religious authority. The original "errand into the wilderness" had produced a learned but cold clergy, complex theological systems, and declining church membership. Second and third-generation colonists lacked their grandparents' conversion experiences. The Half-Way Covenant (1662) allowed baptism without full conversion testimony, diluting the original intensity.

More crucially, economic prosperity had created what Perry Miller called "declension" - drift from spiritual to material concerns. Colonial merchants engaged in Atlantic trade; farmers expanded westward; artisans developed commercial networks. The integrated Puritan community of the 1640s had fragmented into competing economic interests.

### 1.2 Enlightenment Rationalism and Clerical Authority

Simultaneously, Enlightenment rationalism challenged traditional religious authority. Ministers like Charles Chauncy at Harvard embraced Arminian theology (rejecting predestination) and rational religion. This "Old Light" Christianity emphasized moral behavior and intellectual assent rather than emotional conversion experience.

The result was a two-fold crisis: religion was simultaneously too intellectual (alienating common people) and too rational (lacking spiritual power). Into this vacuum stepped a new generation of revival preachers who would transform American Christianity by making it both more democratic and more emotionally intense.

### 1.3 Colonial Diversity and Religious Competition

Unlike European established churches, colonial America contained multiple Protestant denominations competing for adherents: Congregationalists in New England, Anglicans in Virginia, Presbyterians among Scots-Irish immigrants, Baptists in Rhode Island, Quakers in Pennsylvania, German Pietists in the mid-Atlantic.

This pluralistic environment created the preconditions for religious innovation. No single church could claim monopoly; each had to develop techniques for attracting and retaining members. The Great Awakening emerged from this competitive pressure, creating standardized methods for mass conversion that could work across denominational boundaries.

## 2. Jonathan Edwards and the Theology of Religious Experience

### 2.1 The Northampton Revival (1734-1735)

Jonathan Edwards, minister in Northampton, Massachusetts, initiated the Great Awakening through systematic innovation in conversion theology and technique. Edwards combined Calvinist predestination with Lockean psychology, arguing that true conversion involved both intellectual understanding and emotional experience.

Edwards' crucial innovation was **experiential verification** - the idea that genuine conversion could be identified through specific emotional and physical signs. In "A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God" (1737), Edwards documented conversion experiences in clinical detail: weeping, bodily trembling, overwhelming joy, supernatural visions.

This represented a fundamental shift from Puritan conversion narrative. Where earlier Puritans emphasized gradual sanctification and uncertain election, Edwards offered immediate, verifiable spiritual experience. Conversion became an **event** rather than a process, democratically accessible to anyone regardless of education or social status.

### 2.2 The Psychology of Revival

Edwards applied Enlightenment psychology to religious experience. In "Treatise on Religious Affections" (1746), he argued that emotions ("affections") are the proper seat of religious life. True conversion engages both understanding and will through intense feeling.

This psychological approach made revival techniques systematically reproducible. Edwards identified specific conditions that produce conversion: conviction of sin, despair of self-salvation, sudden awareness of grace, overwhelming joy and love. These stages could be induced through proper preaching techniques and social environment.

Crucially, Edwards insisted that emotional conversion was compatible with—indeed required—intellectual theology. His revivals attracted both learned ministers and illiterate farmers, creating a model for cross-class religious appeal that would become central to American evangelicalism.

### 2.3 Divine Sovereignty and Human Agency

Edwards resolved the Calvinist paradox of predestination versus human responsibility through emphasis on **experience over doctrine**. While maintaining that God alone determines salvation, Edwards argued that humans can and must seek conversion through proper spiritual techniques.

This theological innovation justified revival methodology. If conversion is predetermined but experientially verifiable, then mass revival serves God's purpose by providing opportunities for the elect to discover their salvation. The apparent contradiction between divine sovereignty and human effort disappears in the experience of awakening.

This model would prove crucial for American religious export. Edwards' theology allowed missionaries to maintain Calvinist orthodoxy while using Arminian techniques—accepting converts based on emotional experience rather than doctrinal examination.

## 3. George Whitefield and the Technology of Mass Revival

### 3.1 The Grand Itinerant

George Whitefield, an Anglican evangelist, transformed Edwards' local innovation into a transatlantic movement. Between 1738 and 1770, Whitefield conducted seven preaching tours of American colonies, addressing crowds of up to 20,000 people—unprecedented gatherings in colonial society.

Whitefield's innovation was **systematic itinerancy** - organized travel circuits that could reach entire populations. Unlike parish ministers tied to specific congregations, Whitefield created a new religious role: the professional revivalist who could generate spiritual experience anywhere.

This mobility was crucial for democratizing religious access. Rural populations previously dependent on irregular ministerial visits could now experience intensive religious instruction. Urban audiences could choose from multiple revival meetings. Whitefield created the first **religious marketplace** where consumers could select their preferred spiritual experience.

### 3.2 Theatrical Preaching and Emotional Manipulation

Whitefield pioneered theatrical preaching techniques designed for mass emotional impact. Contemporary accounts describe his extraordinary voice (audible to 30,000 people without amplification), dramatic gestures, calculated pauses, and ability to induce weeping in entire audiences.

Benjamin Franklin, initially skeptical, was converted to Whitefield's financial supporter after experiencing his preaching. Franklin calculated that Whitefield could address 30,000 people simultaneously in Philadelphia's public spaces—a larger audience than any previous speaker in American history.

These techniques were consciously developed. Whitefield studied classical rhetoric, observed theatrical performances, and experimented with different emotional approaches. His journals record systematic refinement of revival methods: optimal crowd size, effective gestures, emotional pacing, and conversion appeals.

### 3.3 Print Culture and Religious Celebrity

Whitefield became America's first religious celebrity through innovative use of print media. His sermons were published and circulated throughout the colonies; his journals created a narrative of continuous spiritual adventure; newspapers reported his arrival and results in each town.

This media strategy created **anticipation and validation** for revival experience. Audiences arrived already expecting supernatural events; published testimonies confirmed that others had experienced similar conversions. Print culture standardized revival experience across geographic and denominational boundaries.

The result was the first American "religious brand" - Whitefield's name guaranteed a specific type of spiritual experience regardless of local context. This branding model would become central to American religious marketing and global missionary strategy.

## 4. Frontier Democracy and the Democratization of Religious Authority

### 4.1 New Light vs. Old Light Controversy

The Great Awakening split colonial Protestantism into competing factions. "New Lights" (revival supporters) emphasized conversion experience, emotional preaching, and lay participation. "Old Lights" (revival critics) defended clerical authority, doctrinal orthodoxy, and rational religion.

This controversy fundamentally concerned **religious authority**. Old Lights argued that only educated, ordained ministers could interpret scripture and administer sacraments. New Lights insisted that conversion experience, available to anyone, trumped formal education and clerical office.

The New Light victory established American Christianity's democratic character. Religious authority shifted from institutional position to personal experience. This prepared the ground for subsequent American innovations: Baptist farmer-preachers, Methodist circuit riders, Mormon lay priesthood, and Pentecostal prophets.

### 4.2 Lay Preaching and Popular Participation

Revival meetings encouraged unprecedented lay participation. Converts testified about their experiences; women prayed aloud in mixed assemblies; young people exhorted their elders; slaves and servants addressed their masters about spiritual matters.

These practices violated traditional social hierarchies. In revival context, spiritual experience overrode distinctions of class, gender, age, and (partially) race. The person who had experienced conversion held temporary authority over those who had not, regardless of social position.

This democratic element made American revivalism attractive to common people while threatening established elites. The Great Awakening created a pattern of religious populism that would recur throughout American history: mass spiritual movements that challenge social authority through claims of direct divine revelation.

### 4.3 Schism and Sectarian Competition

Revival controversy produced numerous church splits and new denominations. Congregationalists divided into New Light and Old Light factions; Presbyterians split into Old Side and New Side branches; new groups emerged (Separate Baptists, Free Will Baptists, Methodist societies).

This fragmentation established the American pattern of competitive sectarianism. Rather than one established church serving a geographic area, communities might contain multiple congregations competing for members. Each group had to develop distinctive appeals and maintain conversion techniques.

The result was continuous religious innovation. Denominations experimented with different worship styles, organizational structures, and theological emphases to attract converts. This competitive pressure produced the rich diversity of American Protestant forms and prepared techniques for global export.

## 5. Camp Meetings and the Frontier Revival System

### 5.1 Cane Ridge and the Kentucky Revival (1801)

The Second Great Awakening (1790s-1840s) adapted revival techniques to frontier conditions. The Cane Ridge camp meeting (August 1801) in Kentucky attracted 20,000 people for continuous preaching, prayer, and conversion over six days.

Camp meetings solved the problem of sparse population and scarce ministers on the frontier. By gathering scattered settlers for intensive religious instruction, camp meetings could generate revival experience in areas with minimal religious infrastructure.

The Cane Ridge model established the template for American mass evangelism: multi-denominational cooperation, continuous preaching, emotional worship, public conversion testimony, and community integration through shared spiritual experience.

### 5.2 Physical Manifestations and Supernatural Experience

Frontier revivals featured dramatic physical manifestations: "falling exercise" (collapsing under conviction), "jerks" (uncontrollable spasms), "barking" (animal sounds during prayer), "dancing in the Spirit," and speaking in tongues.

These phenomena served multiple functions. They provided **empirical verification** of supernatural intervention - visible proof that God was acting in the revival. They created **psychological pressure** for conversion - observers felt compelled to seek similar experiences. They established **community boundaries** - those who experienced manifestations belonged to the revival community.

Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian preachers developed techniques for inducing and interpreting these experiences. What began as spontaneous phenomena became systematized methods for producing conversion and maintaining religious excitement.

### 5.3 Organizational Innovation: Circuit Riders and Class Meetings

Frontier conditions required new organizational forms. Methodist circuit riders traveled established routes, preaching to scattered settlements and organizing converts into class meetings. Baptist farmer-preachers combined agricultural work with part-time ministry. Presbyterian presbyteries sent educated ministers on extended preaching tours.

These innovations created **sustainable revival infrastructure**. Rather than depending on celebrity evangelists like Whitefield, frontier churches developed systems for continuous spiritual renewal. Local leadership maintained revival enthusiasm between visits from traveling preachers.

The circuit rider system proved especially effective for territorial expansion. As American settlement moved westward, Methodist and Baptist circuits followed, establishing churches and maintaining revival techniques across the continent. This system would later be adapted for global missionary work.

## 6. The Market Revolution and Religious Competition

### 6.1 Economic Context: Market Society and Religious Choice

The Great Awakening coincided with America's Market Revolution (1815-1860) - the transformation from subsistence agriculture to commercial capitalism. This economic change created the social conditions that made religious competition both possible and necessary.

Market society produced **mobile populations** seeking new opportunities, **competing institutions** offering different services, and **individual choice** as the basis for economic and social relationships. Religious organizations had to adapt to these conditions or lose members to more competitive groups.

Nathan Hatch argues that the Market Revolution and religious democratization were mutually reinforcing. Market logic taught Americans to evaluate competing options and choose the best value. Religious groups learned to market their distinctive advantages and appeal to consumer preferences.

### 6.2 Sectarian Entrepreneurship and Innovation

American denominations became religious entrepreneurs, developing distinctive "products" for the spiritual marketplace. Methodists emphasized emotional experience and social mobility. Baptists stressed individual conversion and congregational democracy. Presbyterians combined intellectual respectability with revival enthusiasm.

New groups emerged to serve underserved markets: Christians (Disciples of Christ) for frontier egalitarianism, Universalists for liberal theology, Adventists for millennialist excitement, Latter-day Saints for restored apostolic authority.

This entrepreneurial competition drove continuous innovation in worship styles, organizational structures, theological emphasis, and social appeals. American Christianity became the most diverse and dynamic religious system in the world through systematic adaptation to market conditions.

### 6.3 Voluntary Association and Individual Choice

Revival techniques created **voluntary religious association** - membership based on personal decision rather than birth, geography, or social position. This represented a fundamental break from European established church models.

Voluntary association required continuous recruitment and retention efforts. Churches had to maintain conversion techniques, develop member services, and create incentives for continued participation. Religion became a service industry competing for voluntary supporters.

This voluntary model prepared American Christianity for global export. Missionary societies, voluntary associations funded by individual donations, could establish churches anywhere without state support. Revival techniques could generate conversions regardless of local religious traditions.

## 7. Women, Emotion, and the Feminization of American Religion

### 7.1 Female Religious Leadership

The Great Awakening created unprecedented opportunities for female religious leadership. Women testified about conversion experiences, led prayer meetings, organized charitable societies, and (in some groups) preached to mixed audiences.

This female participation was justified by revival theology. If conversion experience validated religious authority, then women who had experienced awakening could claim spiritual leadership. The Holy Spirit, revival preachers argued, chose vessels regardless of gender.

Female religious leadership challenged traditional gender hierarchies while remaining within Christian theological frameworks. Women gained public voice and organizational experience through religious participation, preparing the ground for subsequent women's rights movements.

### 7.2 Emotional Culture and Domestic Religion

Revival emphasis on religious emotion aligned with emerging ideals of female sensibility and domestic virtue. Women were considered naturally more emotional, spiritual, and morally sensitive than men - qualities that revival culture celebrated.

This "feminization of American religion" (Ann Douglas) transformed worship styles, theological emphases, and church social functions. Churches became centers for emotional expression, moral reform, and domestic values rather than intellectual debate or political authority.

The result was a distinctive American religious culture that emphasized personal relationship with Jesus, emotional worship experience, and social reform through moral influence - a culture that would prove especially attractive to women in missionary contexts worldwide.

### 7.3 Reform Movements and Social Activism

Female religious leadership generated numerous reform movements: abolition, temperance, women's rights, prison reform, education, and foreign missions. Revival-converted women organized voluntary associations to address social problems through Christian activism.

These reform movements created networks of female religious leadership that transcended denominational boundaries. Evangelical women developed organizational skills, political consciousness, and global perspective through reform activity.

The missionary movement, especially, provided women with opportunities for global leadership and cross-cultural religious work. Female missionaries became the primary agents for exporting American revival techniques to Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

## 8. Theological Innovation: From Predestination to Free Will

### 8.1 Charles Finney and the New Measures

Charles Grandison Finney (1792-1875) systematized Great Awakening techniques into reproducible revival methods. His "New Measures" included: protracted meetings, anxious bench, public prayer for individuals by name, female participation, and immediate conversion appeals.

Finney's crucial innovation was **theological Arminianism** - the doctrine that individuals can choose salvation through proper spiritual techniques. This broke decisively with Calvinist predestination, making conversion dependent on human decision rather than divine election.

This theological shift justified aggressive revival methodology. If salvation depends on human choice, then preachers should use every effective technique to promote conversion. Emotional manipulation, social pressure, and systematic persuasion become legitimate evangelistic tools.

### 8.2 Perfectionism and Social Reform

Finney's theology led to perfectionism - the belief that conversion enables complete sanctification in this life. Perfect Christians, he argued, should work to perfect society through moral reform and social activism.

This perfectionist impulse generated the great reform movements of the antebellum period: abolition, temperance, women's rights, and public education. Revival-converted Christians felt obligated to transform society according to Christian principles.

The connection between revival and reform created a distinctive American religious pattern: personal conversion experience leading to social activism. This pattern would be exported globally through American missionary efforts.

### 8.3 Millennialism and National Destiny

Great Awakening theology increasingly emphasized America's special role in God's plan. Revival preachers proclaimed that American religious freedom and democratic government prepared the way for Christ's millennial kingdom.

This religious nationalism justified American territorial expansion and global missionary activity. If America represented God's chosen nation, then American religious and political systems should be exported worldwide for humanity's benefit.

The result was a fusion of revival techniques, democratic ideology, and imperial expansion that would shape American foreign policy and global Christianity for the next two centuries.

## 9. African Americans and the Great Awakening

### 9.1 Conversion and Community

The Great Awakening provided African Americans with access to conversion experience and Christian community. Slaves and free blacks attended revival meetings, experienced conversion, and formed independent religious congregations.

African American participation in revival culture was simultaneously empowering and constraining. Conversion experience validated black spiritual authority and created interracial religious fellowship. But revival theology also justified slavery through emphasis on spiritual rather than social equality.

### 9.2 Independent Churches and Religious Leadership

Revival conversions led to independent African American churches and denominational structures. The African Methodist Episcopal Church (1816), African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (1821), and numerous Baptist congregations provided autonomous religious leadership for black communities.

These independent churches adapted revival techniques to African American cultural traditions, creating distinctive worship styles that emphasized emotional expression, communal participation, and liberation themes.

### 9.3 Abolitionism and Social Justice

African American revival experience generated powerful abolitionist testimony. Converted slaves and free blacks testified about their spiritual equality with whites, challenging racial justifications for slavery.

White evangelicals were divided. Some accepted the logic of spiritual equality and became abolitionists. Others maintained that revival addressed spiritual rather than social conditions, defending slavery as compatible with Christian conversion.

This tension between spiritual equality and social hierarchy would persist throughout American Christianity, complicating missionary efforts in racially diverse societies worldwide.

## 10. Global Export: Revival Techniques as Missionary Methods

### 10.1 The Second Great Awakening and Foreign Missions

The Second Great Awakening (1790s-1840s) generated the first systematic American foreign missionary efforts. Revival-converted Christians organized voluntary societies to export American Christianity worldwide.

The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (1810) sent missionaries to India, Hawaii, the Ottoman Empire, and East Africa. These missionaries carried revival techniques along with Protestant theology, creating American-style Christianity in global contexts.

### 10.2 Adaptation and Cultural Translation

American missionaries discovered that revival techniques required adaptation to local cultural contexts. Direct emotional appeals effective in frontier America might fail in societies with different social structures and religious traditions.

Successful missionaries learned to modify revival methods while maintaining core techniques: emphasis on conversion experience, individual decision, emotional worship, and voluntary association. These adaptations created diverse global forms of evangelical Christianity.

### 10.3 The Template for Global Evangelicalism

The Great Awakening established the template for global evangelical Christianity: emphasis on personal conversion experience, emotional worship, individual religious choice, voluntary church membership, and aggressive evangelistic outreach.

This template would be reproduced worldwide through American missionary activity, creating a global evangelical culture that transcends denominational and national boundaries while maintaining distinctively American characteristics.

---

## 11. Institutional Routinization and the Birth of Denominationalism

### 11.1 From Revival to Denomination

The Great Awakening's spontaneous spiritual energy required institutional organization to survive. Revival converts formed churches, elected ministers, established educational institutions, and created denominational structures.

This routinization process (Weber) transformed charismatic revival into bureaucratic organization. Emotional conversion experience became standardized ritual; prophetic preaching became professional ministry; voluntary association became institutional membership.

### 11.2 Educational Innovation and Cultural Authority

Revival denominations established colleges and seminaries to train ministers and educate members: Princeton (Presbyterian), Yale (Congregationalist), Brown (Baptist), Methodism's numerous academies.

These educational institutions created intellectual respectability for revival Christianity while maintaining emphasis on conversion experience. Educated ministers could engage Enlightenment rationalism while practicing revival techniques.

### 11.3 The Evangelical Establishment

By 1860, American Protestantism had achieved cultural dominance through revival-based denominationalism. Evangelical values shaped public education, social reform, political discourse, and foreign policy.

This evangelical establishment provided the institutional foundation for global Protestant expansion. American denominations had the organizational capacity, financial resources, and cultural confidence to export their religious system worldwide.

---

## 12. Conclusion: Democratic Religion and Global Export

The Great Awakening created the distinctively American form of Christianity that would be exported globally through missionary activity and cultural influence. Its key innovations - emphasis on emotional conversion experience, democratic religious authority, competitive sectarianism, and voluntary association - became the template for modern evangelicalism worldwide.

### 12.1 The Democratic Revolution in Religion

The Great Awakening democratized religious authority by making conversion experience rather than clerical office the basis for spiritual leadership. This democratic principle would prove attractive in societies undergoing political democratization worldwide.

### 12.2 Market Mechanisms and Religious Choice

Revival techniques created religious competition and consumer choice, adapting Christianity to market society. This competitive model would prove effective in pluralistic societies where established churches lost their monopoly.

### 12.3 Preparation for Global Export

The Great Awakening prepared American Christianity for global expansion by developing techniques that worked across cultural boundaries: emphasis on individual experience rather than cultural tradition, emotional appeals that transcended intellectual barriers, and organizational forms that could adapt to local conditions.

**The Great Awakening thus represents the crucial American innovation that transforms Protestant "religion" from European establishment into global evangelical movement - setting up both the Mormon experiment (Chapter 8) and the colonial export of American religious forms that will follow.**
