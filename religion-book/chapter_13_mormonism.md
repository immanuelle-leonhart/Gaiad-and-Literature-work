## Re-Enchanting the Marketplace: Early Mormonism as Communal, Cosmic, and Counter-Capitalist

"As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may be." —Lorenzo Snow (1840s)

### 1 Introduction: The Strange Career of the Latter-day Saints

Nineteenth-century Mormonism erupted out of the Protestant "burned-over district" yet immediately rejected the disenchanted cosmos that mainline revivalism had normalized. Joseph Smith's revelations insisted that all matter is eternal, that gods progress, and that humanity may join their ranks. This audacious cosmology fuelled experiments in consecrated property, plural marriage, and theocratic settlement—practices that, at their inception, looked more like utopian socialism than the bourgeois respectability later associated with Utah. Whereas Marx denounced religion as ideology, early Latter-day Saints weaponised myth to build a counter-economy; they tried to reterritorialise the capitalist frontier on communal lines even as they borrowed its techniques of movement and expansion.

We read Mormonism here through four lenses:
- Marx & primitive accumulation – Mormon consecration fought enclosure with a covenantal commons.
- Deleuze & Guattari's "re-enchantment machine" – Smith decoded Protestantism only to replug believers into an infinitely expandable cosmos.
- Walter Benjamin's dialectical image – the Nauvoo temple as a revolutionary montage of Israelite, Masonic, and American symbols.
- Lewis Mumford's "megamachine" – Brigham Young's territorial kingdom anticipates the technocratic state yet briefly subordinates it to agrarian cooperation.

### 2 Cosmos Reclaimed: Eternal Matter and the Adam-God Turn

#### 2.1 Material Spirit and Eternal Progress

Smith's May 1843 discourse declared that "spirit is a refined matter" and that intelligence "cannot be created or made". Matter itself is divine; the world is enchanted down to its atoms. Snow's famous couplet turns this into eschatology: humans may ascend the same ontological ladder God once climbed. Where classical Christianity saw an unbridgeable Creator-creature gap, Mormonism installs a cosmic proletariat: every being can rise by cooperative labor—temple work, covenant, and family sealing.

#### 2.2 The Adam-God Doctrine as Radical Genealogy

Brigham Young's sermons went further: "Adam is our Father and God… the God of the earth". Scholars debate the doctrine's orthodoxy, but politically it relocated sovereignty from a distant omnipotence to the first embodied patriarch. In Deleuzian terms, Young folds divinity back into the plane of immanence, short-circuiting the transcendent despotic signifier. God becomes an ancestor-king whose authority is genealogical rather than absolutist—a move that both empowers communal kin-structures and risks reinforcing patriarchal domination.

### 3 Consecration, the United Orders, and Anti-Capitalist Praxis

#### 3.1 Law of Consecration

Revelations of 1831 introduced a covenant to "hold all things in common" and appoint bishops as stewards. Private property was to be subordinated to need; surplus redistributed. This resembles the primitive Christian communism of Acts and echoes Fourierist and Owenite experiments sprouting across America.

#### 3.2 United Orders as Communal Corporations

From Kirtland (1830s) to Brigham City (1870s) the church organised United Orders—civic-economic co-ops where families deeded land to a common fund and received stewardships in return. These orders:
- Abolished wage labour among saints.
- Fixed prices collectively to undercut speculators.
- Instituted bishop's storehouses as proto-welfare.

Marx might read this as an anti-enclosure revolt: a frontier commons against national banks and railroad capital. Yet the Orders collapsed under federal pressure, internal inequality, and Utah's integration into transcontinental markets—illustrating Benjamin's insight that every revolutionary "image" is shot through with its counter-image of defeat.

### 4 Contradictions: Polygyny, Patriarchy, and the Color Line

Radical cosmology coexisted with radical patriarchy. Plural marriage concentrated authority in male priesthood; the Adam-God myth literalised male divinity. Simultaneously, Brigham Young codified a priesthood/racial ban (1852–1978) that excluded Black saints from temple rites. Thus a movement born in communitarian aspiration reproduced settler hierarchies—an ambivalence Deleuze would call the "simultaneity of deterritorialisation and reterritorialisation."

### 5 Comparative Interlude

#### 5.1 State Shinto and Imperial Theosis

Meiji leaders nationalised Shinto in 1868, enthroning the Emperor as living deity to mobilise agrarian subjects for industrial empire. Like Mormonism, State Shinto used genealogy (sun-descended Tennō) and temple ritual to sacralise settlement (Hokkaidō) and communal labour. Both projects fused myth with colonisation, but where State Shinto enforced hierarchy, early Mormonism preached lay theosis and voluntary consecration.

#### 5.2 God-Building under Soviet Socialism

Lunacharsky's bogostroitel'stvo sought an atheist civic cult harnessing ritual and myth for proletarian uplift. Mormon temple liturgy—with its Masonic dramas and covenantal oaths—already performed a similar myth-engineering, but in a theistic register. Both movements reveal how modern projects—imperial, socialist, or sectarian—turn to new theurgies when Enlightenment rationality proves cold.

### 6 From Kingdom of God to Corporation of the President

Railroads, federal anti-polygamy campaigns, and the 1890 Manifesto forced Utah's integration. By the mid-20th century the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had become one of America's wealthiest corporations, investing in media, insurance, and global real estate. The communal Orders were replaced by tithing and for-profit subsidiaries; polygamy was renounced; racial bans persisted until 1978. Mumford's "megamachine" triumphs: the church now operates data centers and maintains an online genealogy empire—redeeming the dead with cloud computing rather than agrarian commons. Cosmic optimism survives, but the cooperative economy has been thoroughly reterritorialised by finance capital.

### 7 Conclusion: A Dialectical Legacy

Early Mormonism dramatises a recurring theme in this book: attempts to re-enchant and re-common the world under capitalist pressure. Smith's material cosmology and the United Orders were genuine gestures toward what Benjamin called "the weak messianic power" of the oppressed. Yet patriarchal and racial exclusions, plus the irresistible pull of westward markets, foreclosed the most radical possibilities. Today, LDS humanitarianism and missionary networks mirror neoliberal NGO logic, while temple theology still whispers the old promise of godhood. Mormonism thus stands as a dialectical image—at once a frontier socialism and a template for corporate religion—offering both caution and inspiration to contemporary movements seeking to reclaim myth and economics from the dead hand of capital.

### Cosmic Enchantment and Zion Ideal: Early Mormonism as Utopian Reform

Early Mormonism emerged in the 1830s as a radically re-enchanted vision of Christianity. In Weberian terms, Joseph Smith embodied charismatic authority – a living prophet whose revelations transformed theology and social organization. Unlike Protestant individual salvation, Smith's revelations envisioned a physical cosmos imbued with sacred meaning. In Mormon doctrine all intelligence and matter are eternal – "God is an Architect of the material universe, not the Source of all things". Thus God and man share the same kind of substance: early Mormons taught that humans are literally "gods in embryo," destined to progress eternally toward divine fullness. Brigham Young even preached the controversial "Adam–God" theory – that the first man Adam was himself God the Father – a startling affirmation of Mormon pantheon.

These doctrines re-enchanted the world: nature and history were charged with mythic significance, and the temple was imagined as a direct pattern of heaven on earth (Eliade's sacred space). As Mircea Eliade observed, religious rites recreate a primordial "mythic time"; LDS temple ceremonies explicitly dramatize creation–fall–exaltation myths, sanctifying place and moment. In this early phase the universe was not a bare mechanism but a living cosmos of gods, spirits, and humans evolving together.

Concretely, this re-enchantment included planets, angels, and multiple worlds. The Book of Abraham (LDS scripture) describes councils of gods organizing matter to build worlds. Joseph Smith taught that every righteous man receives a kingdom and may "increase in glory" forever. This cosmic theology contrasts sharply with the "disenchanted" world of 19th-century Protestant liberalism (Weber's secular age) – Mormonism insisted on eternal progression and a material universe, defying the notion that spirit is immaterial or distant.

### Communal Zion and Anti-Capitalist Praxis

Early Mormons did not just dream; they acted on utopian ideals. The Book of Mormon itself envisions an "ideal society" where "there were no poor among them" because "all things [were] common". In practice Joseph Smith ordained a Law of Consecration: followers deeded property to the Church and received stewardships of land. In Kirtland (Ohio) and Missouri (1830s), Latter-day Saints attempted quasi-communist communities based on these revelations. Inspired by millennial egalitarianism, they set up cooperative businesses, shared livestock and tools, and even started the Kirtland Safety Society bank as a communal credit venture.

Later, under Brigham Young in Utah, dozens of United Order settlements were launched: local wards deeded property to the bishop and held "stewardships," returning surplus production to a communal storehouse. These egalitarian communities aimed to eliminate poverty and dependence on outsider markets – "free the Mormons from dependence on outside merchants, and eliminate poverty".

This communalism explicitly opposed the new market capitalism of the age. As one historian notes, most 19th-century Mormonism "rejected capitalist development and preached Christian communalism". Mormons had suffered through Jacksonian market crashes and land speculation; in response they built communal storehouses, welfare kitchens, and joint labor projects (including relief farming and company towns). Young even declared "I will cut deeper than the ancients: they proposed to be equal, I propose to give equal" (paraphrased from Brigham). The United Orders and Zion projects resembled other utopian socialist experiments (e.g. Owenite or Shaker communities), challenging "fundamental ideals" of American society.
