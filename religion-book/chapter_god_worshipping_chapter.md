# God-worshipping chapter

## Proper chapter
The phenomenon of god-worshipping is an ancient one. A concept much older than what is often called "religion".    

### What Is a god?
There are many different ideas of what a god is. 

I am specifically using the word god without capitalization, because when capitalized it often implies a monotheistic deity, which is not my intent.  

The Japanese philosopher Motoori Norinaga puts the position to words better than I ever could, in his analysis of the Japanese word Kami (神), a word I translate as "god". {{quote|Generally speaking, "kami" denotes, in the first place, the deities of heaven and earth that appear in the ancient texts, as well as the spirits enshrined in the shrines. Furthermore, among all kinds of beings—including not only human beings but also such objects as birds, beasts, trees, grass, seas, mountains, and so forth—any being whatsoever which possesses some eminent quality out of the ordinary, and is awe-inspiring, is called kami.

(Eminence here does not refer simply to superiority in nobility, goodness, or merit. Evil or strange things, if they are extraordinarily awe-inspiring, are also called kami.)

Among things which are called kami, thunder is evidently included, since it is usually referred to as narukami or kaminari ("pealing kami"). Also included are such things as dragons, kotama, foxes, and so forth—beings which are eminently wonderful and awe-inspiring.

Kotama is what people today call tengu, and in Chinese writings it is referred to as a mountain goblin. In the Nihongi and the Man'yōshū, we see the tiger and the wolf, too, called kami. There are also cases in which peaches were given the divine name Okamuzumi no Mikoto, and a necklace was called Mikuratana no Kami. Furthermore, we often find cases in which rocks, stumps of trees, and leaves of plants spoke audibly—these too are kami.

Frequently, seas and mountains are called kami. It is not that the spirit of the sea or mountain is referred to as kami, but that the sea or the mountain itself is regarded as kami. This is because they are exceedingly awe-inspiring.

Thus, kami are manifold: some kami are noble, while others are lowly; some are strong, whereas others are weak; again, some kami are good, while others are evil. Corresponding to this variety, the will and acts of kami are also diverse. Therefore, we cannot speak of kami in definite terms.[^cite_1](^cite_1)}}

Translating kami as "god' is not entirely without controversy. I render *kami* as “god” because the English word already functions as a capacious suitcase that generations of translators have stuffed with everything from Aten and Zeus down to household lares, carved fetishes, and even the physical idols that house them; in other words, the term is habitually applied to precisely the same spectrum of awe‑inspiring, ritually addressed agents that Motoori describes. The fact that English speakers also reserve an uppercase “God” for a singular, omnipotent being does not disqualify the lowercase term from this broader usage—it simply reveals a monotheistic bias toward unity that I wish to keep visible rather than work around. By folding *kami* into “god” I highlight the essential commonality that motivates this book: across cultures, what matters is the act of directed veneration, not the entity’s metaphysical rank or doctrinal classification. Whether the being is a storm‑spirit, a saint’s relic, a talking mountain, or a “messenger” or “manifestation” of an otherwise unitary deity, English historically calls it a god when worship enters the picture—and that functional, relational sense is exactly what my argument needs.

In this book, I define a god as "that which is worshipped." This is consistent with the etymologies of words like *theos* (linked to festivals and divine appearances), *god* (from Germanic roots meaning "that which is called upon"), and especially *yazata* (an Avestan term meaning "worthy of worship").

I do not judge which gods are worthy of worship. That is not my role. I believe the gods I worship are worthy; others may disagree. Monotheists may claim only one yazata exists. Polytheists may recognize many. But the essential feature is directedness: worship is a transitive verb.

In English, worship is often used vaguely. For instance when people mention "**Sunday worship**", there's very little, if any, actual discussion of what is being worshipped there. Because in this context, the target of worship is already assumed to be Yahweh/Jesus. But in god-worshipping, the object must be named. The attention must be directed. 

The term "god" is sometimes rejected within certain traditions because of their own internal rules and theology. The word worship has some similar issues. And this is before the issues of people objecting to descriptions because they do not believe in a tradition.  

Few people are going to object to my description of Yahweh (יהוה‎) as a god. Nobody who understands Arabic will object to my description of Allah (الله) as a god. Although certainly some will, just because they read implications into using the Arabic word, used by Muslims, Christians, and Jews alike. 

No Christians will object to my description of Jesus as a god. But it might raise eyebrows if I called the Holy Spirit a god. In Shinto **Amaterasu Ōmikami** (天照大御神) is a god. If I described the Virgin Mary as a god, people will object. In Catholicism there are four words that I would translate as worship: Latria, Hyperdulia, Protodulia, and Dulia in descending order of precedence. Reserved for the Trinity, the Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph, and other Saints respectively.[^cite_2](^cite_2) While an interesting distinction, I see no reason to make this distinction in a general theory of god-worshipping, and I will categorize them all as god-worshipping. Likewise in a Japanese context if I called Shakyamuni, better known as "The Buddha" in the Western world a god, that will also raise eyebrows. And the same with Fudō Myōō (不動明王). This is because of internal Buddhist terminology distinctions that aren't relevant to this account.

Mary is a god. Fudō Myōō (不動明王) is a god. Dainichi Nyorai (大日如来) is a god. George Washington is a god. And Donald Trump is unfortunately a god. Gods vary in status, but the act of worship is what defines them.

### The Stages of god-Worshipping

I am a ritual-first theorist. I do not believe myth comes first. I believe god-worshipping begins in four (sometimes five) stages:

1. **Animatism**: A background sense that the world is filled with forces, intentions, and meanings. This is not yet god-worship. It is the fertile soil from which it grows.
1. **Recognition**: A particular person has an experience—a striking encounter with a place, a being, an event. They detect agency. They feel awe. This is sometimes described in cognitive science as a "hyperactive agency detection device" (HADD). But it is not a bug. It is a feature.
1. **Ritual Relationship**: The person begins to act differently toward this thing. They visit the tree. They talk to the mountain. They give offerings to a rock. These rituals are meaningful because they express and shape the relationship.
1. **Mythic Codification**: Stories develop. Some are based on real events. Some are exaggerated memories. Some are invented. But they all help frame the relationship in shared, communicable terms.
1. **Exaptation and Survival**: If the original conditions change, the cult may collapse. But sometimes it adapts. A meme, story, or symbol gets repurposed in a new setting. This is exaptation—the evolutionary reuse of a structure for a new function.

A successful god-worshipping lineage can return from Stage 5 to Stage 3. This is what I see in enduring traditions like Ise, Izumo, and the cult of Mary. While there are clear elements of this in some of the even larger faiths like Christianity and Islam, I am hesitant to describe them this way, because these large monotheistic traditions work through overcoding.
### Archetypes, Symbols, and the Limits of Jung

God-worshipping uses symbols. It may involve archetypes. But gods are not just symbols or archetypes. They are not solipsistic projections of the psyche.

Jung's theory of archetypes has had a profound influence on how many modern spiritual thinkers understand gods, especially within neopaganism and New Age movements. However, this influence has often been filtered through a distorted lens, most notably popularized by figures like Jordan Peterson. In this misreading, archetypes become rigid psychological constants—idealized templates that structure the psyche and should be revered as if they were gods themselves.

But even Jung himself was ambivalent. He saw archetypes as deeply ingrained psychic structures, yes—but not always as liberating. In fact, Jung sometimes treated them as imprisoning forces—inescapable filters that shape perception and limit autonomy. From this perspective, archetypes are not pantheons; they are prisons. They are not the gods themselves, but patterns in which gods are often perceived.

To reduce gods to archetypes is to mistake the medium for the message, the echo for the voice. Archetypes are symbolic language used by the psyche to interpret divine presence, but the divine itself is not exhausted by this interpretation. If one worships an archetype alone, one risks worshipping one's own mental furniture.

This leads to a kind of spiritual solipsism. If all gods are only aspects of the self, then the world becomes flat—nothing but mirrors. God-worshipping, in contrast, is about stepping beyond the self. It is a practice of wonder, humility, and relation.

### A Better Ontology

Instead of reducing gods to psychological archetypes, we can approach them through alternative ontological frameworks.

One option is object-oriented ontology (OOO), which views all entities—humans, trees, gods, electrons—as equally real and equally withdrawn. In this view, a god is a real being that does not fully reveal itself to us, that resists total access or representation. This mirrors the experience many people have in ritual: the sense that the divine is there, but never fully captured.

Another option is the metaphysics of the Avataṃsaka Sūtra, a foundational Mahāyāna Buddhist text. In it, the universe is described as an interpenetrating network of infinite, radiant entities. Every phenomenon reflects and enfolds every other. Gods, in this framework, are not external rulers or mere mental constructs—they are nodes in the vast, luminous net of being. They are not "out there" or "in here"—they are relational, embedded, emergent.

Both frameworks emphasize that gods are real, but not reducible. They are not symbols in a book, or projections in a mind. They are presences that make claims on us.

And yet—you, reader, are also a god. Not a god because you are perfect or powerful, but because you are worthy of love, attention, and even worship. To read this book in earnest is already to participate in something sacred. If you send me an email, I will pray to you.

### Evolutionary Benefits and Origins

God-worshipping is not a relic of the past—it evolved because it works. It encourages epistemic humility, sustained curiosity, and social bonding. It allows people to enter flow states, enhance attention, and synchronize with others through ritual. It fosters communitas—a shared sense of meaning that transcends individual roles.

## Toward a Celestial Anthropology
Many evolutionary theorists and materialists approach god-worship with a chthonic worldview: humans as reactive, preprogrammed, and mindless actors within nature. I prefer a **celestial worldview**: humans as intelligent, meaning-making, aspirational creatures whose behaviors emerge from curiosity and wonder.

In Erich Fromm’s terms, the **having mode** wants to possess knowledge. The **being mode** wants to relate to the world in openness. god-worshipping comes from the being mode. It does not ask, "What can I get from this god?" but "What can I learn? What can I love?"

This is why god-worshipping evolved. It fosters epistemic humility. It promotes attention. It builds communitas. It is useful in almost every domain of human behavior.

Cultural appropriation, in its worst form, is capitalist decoding: stripping a sacred practice of its meaning. But faithful god-worshipping—even across cultures—is an act of recoding. It is rebellion. It is life.

Let there be 8 million gods, for there are 8 million ways to love the world.

### Requested Summary: Major Thinkers on Religion (with Your Provisional Takes)
Each entry is given in two parts:

- **Their View** (one to two points)
- **Your Current Take** (one to two points)

*

#### 4. Victor Turner

- *View:* Ritual produces liminality and communitas—moments of collective transformation.
- *Your Take:* Strong influence. Your vision of revolution as sacred ritual draws from Turner. Worship is a space of reconstruction and communitas, not control or repression.

#### 5. Mircea Eliade

- *View:* The sacred ruptures profane time and space. Myths and rituals return us to sacred origins.
- *Your Take:* You value his phenomenology of the sacred, but go beyond it. Eliade describes well, but doesn't reconstruct. You want gods that **act**, not myths that **replay**.

#### 6. Daniel Dennett

- *View:* Religion is a product of cognitive evolution—useful once, now mostly vestigial. Should be studied scientifically.
- *Your Take:* A soft anti-theist. His curiosity is useful, but his vision is sterile. He explains ritual functionally but ignores its *spiritual power* and *desire*.

#### 7. Richard Dawkins

- *View:* Religion is a harmful meme complex. god belief is irrational and dangerous.
- *Your Take:* A tragic figure. He discovered memes and then recoiled. His rejection of religious meaning is rooted in fear that *atheism itself might be a mind-virus*.

#### 8. John Vervaeke

- *View:* Religion is an ecology of practices that train relevance realization. Meaning is enacted through participation, not belief.
- *Your Take:* Personally influential. He opened doors, but doesn’t go far enough. You part ways where he avoids gods and worship, preferring abstract “meaning.”
