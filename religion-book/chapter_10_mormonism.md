## 1. Introduction: The Strange Career of the Latter-day Saints

Nineteenth-century Mormonism erupted out of the Protestant "burned-over district" yet immediately rejected the disenchanted cosmos that mainline revivalism had normalized. Joseph Smith's revelations insisted that all matter is eternal, that gods progress, and that humanity may join their ranks. This audacious cosmology fuelled experiments in consecrated property, plural marriage, and theocratic settlement—practices that, at their inception, looked more like utopian socialism than the bourgeois respectability later associated with Utah. Whereas Marx denounced religion as ideology, early Latter-day Saints weaponised myth to build a counter-economy; they tried to reterritorialise the capitalist frontier on communal lines even as they borrowed its techniques of movement and expansion.

We read Mormonism here through four lenses:
- **Marx & primitive accumulation** – Mormon consecration fought enclosure with a covenantal commons.
- **Deleuze & Guattari's "re-enchantment machine"** – Smith decoded Protestantism only to replug believers into an infinitely expandable cosmos.
- **Walter Benjamin's dialectical image** – the Nauvoo temple as a revolutionary montage of Israelite, Masonic, and American symbols.
- **Lewis Mumford's "megamachine"** – Brigham Young's territorial kingdom anticipates the technocratic state yet briefly subordinates it to agrarian cooperation.

## 2. Cosmos Reclaimed: Eternal Matter and the Adam-God Turn

### 2.1 Material Spirit and Eternal Progress

Smith's May 1843 discourse declared that "spirit is a refined matter" and that intelligence "cannot be created or made". Matter itself is divine; the world is enchanted down to its atoms. Snow's famous couplet turns this into eschatology: humans may ascend the same ontological ladder God once climbed. Where classical Christianity saw an unbridgeable Creator-creature gap, Mormonism installs a cosmic proletariat: every being can rise by cooperative labor—temple work, covenant, and family sealing.

### 2.2 The Adam-God Doctrine as Radical Genealogy

Brigham Young's sermons went further: "Adam is our Father and God… the God of the earth". Scholars debate the doctrine's orthodoxy, but politically it relocated sovereignty from a distant omnipotence to the first embodied patriarch. In Deleuzian terms, Young folds divinity back into the plane of immanence, short-circuiting the transcendent despotic signifier. God becomes an ancestor-king whose authority is genealogical rather than absolutist—a move that both empowers communal kin-structures and risks reinforcing patriarchal domination.

### 2.3 Cosmic Enchantment and Multiple Worlds

Early Mormonism emerged in the 1830s as a radically re-enchanted vision of Christianity. In Weberian terms, Joseph Smith embodied charismatic authority – a living prophet whose revelations transformed theology and social organization. Unlike Protestant individual salvation, Smith's revelations envisioned a physical cosmos imbued with sacred meaning. In Mormon doctrine all intelligence and matter are eternal – "God is an Architect of the material universe, not the Source of all things". Thus God and man share the same kind of substance: early Mormons taught that humans are literally "gods in embryo," destined to progress eternally toward divine fullness.

Brigham Young even preached the controversial "Adam–God" theory – that the first man Adam was himself God the Father – a startling affirmation of Mormon pantheon. These doctrines re-enchanted the world: nature and history were charged with mythic significance, and the temple was imagined as a direct pattern of heaven on earth (Eliade's sacred space). As Mircea Eliade observed, religious rites recreate a primordial "mythic time"; LDS temple ceremonies explicitly dramatize creation–fall–exaltation myths, sanctifying place and moment. In this early phase the universe was not a bare mechanism but a living cosmos of gods, spirits, and humans evolving together.

Concretely, this re-enchantment included planets, angels, and multiple worlds. The Book of Abraham (LDS scripture) describes councils of gods organizing matter to build worlds. Joseph Smith taught that every righteous man receives a kingdom and may "increase in glory" forever. This cosmic theology contrasts sharply with the "disenchanted" world of 19th-century Protestant liberalism (Weber's secular age) – Mormonism insisted on eternal progression and a material universe, defying the notion that spirit is immaterial or distant.

## 3. Consecration, the United Orders, and Anti-Capitalist Praxis

### 3.1 Law of Consecration

Revelations of 1831 introduced a covenant to "hold all things in common" and appoint bishops as stewards. Private property was to be subordinated to need; surplus redistributed. This resembles the primitive Christian communism of Acts and echoes Fourierist and Owenite experiments sprouting across America.

### 3.2 United Orders as Communal Corporations

From Kirtland (1830s) to Brigham City (1870s) the church organised United Orders—civic-economic co-ops where families deeded land to a common fund and received stewardships in return. These orders:
- Abolished wage labour among saints.
- Fixed prices collectively to undercut speculators.
- Instituted bishop's storehouses as proto-welfare.

Marx might read this as an anti-enclosure revolt: a frontier commons against national banks and railroad capital. Yet the Orders collapsed under federal pressure, internal inequality, and Utah's integration into transcontinental markets—illustrating Benjamin's insight that every revolutionary "image" is shot through with its counter-image of defeat.

### 3.3 Communal Zion and Anti-Capitalist Praxis

Early Mormons did not just dream; they acted on utopian ideals. The Book of Mormon itself envisions an "ideal society" where "there were no poor among them" because "all things [were] common". In practice Joseph Smith ordained a Law of Consecration: followers deeded property to the Church and received stewardships of land. In Kirtland (Ohio) and Missouri (1830s), Latter-day Saints attempted quasi-communist communities based on these revelations. Inspired by millennial egalitarianism, they set up cooperative businesses, shared livestock and tools, and even started the Kirtland Safety Society bank as a communal credit venture.

Later, under Brigham Young in Utah, dozens of United Order settlements were launched: local wards deeded property to the bishop and held "stewardships," returning surplus production to a communal storehouse. These egalitarian communities aimed to eliminate poverty and dependence on outsider markets – "free the Mormons from dependence on outside merchants, and eliminate poverty".

This communalism explicitly opposed the new market capitalism of the age. As one historian notes, most 19th-century Mormonism "rejected capitalist development and preached Christian communalism". Mormons had suffered through Jacksonian market crashes and land speculation; in response they built communal storehouses, welfare kitchens, and joint labor projects (including relief farming and company towns). Young even declared "I will cut deeper than the ancients: they proposed to be equal, I propose to give equal" (paraphrased from Brigham). The United Orders and Zion projects resembled other utopian socialist experiments (e.g. Owenite or Shaker communities), challenging "fundamental ideals" of American society – private property, republican politics, capitalist competition, and monogamous family norms. Plural marriage itself broke bourgeois conventions of the family. In short, Mormonism offered a nearly communistic alternative: pooled resources, centralized planning by local bishops, and the credo of "no poor among them".

Marxist anthropology would note that early Mormon Zion sought to create a classless "Kingdom of God" on earth, presaging aspects of socialism. Church intellectuals like Hugh Nibley later lamented that the modern church abandoned these values. By the 1890s, under outside pressure (polygamy prosecutions, federal taxes) most communal programs ceased and Utah joined the U.S.; Mormons "embrac[ed] market capitalism" to survive. The United Orders disappeared in mainstream LDS life (surviving only in fringe fundamentalist sects), and Church leaders publicly denounced socialism. What remained of communalism was absorbed into the Church welfare and self-reliance system (a moderated version of Zion's charities). In Marx's terms, the early Mormon "base" (property relations) shifted back into the capitalist superstructure, and religion now began to reinforce rather than challenge the existing order.

## 4. Contradictions: Polygyny, Patriarchy, and the Color Line

Radical cosmology coexisted with radical patriarchy. Plural marriage concentrated authority in male priesthood; the Adam-God myth literalised male divinity. Simultaneously, Brigham Young codified a priesthood/racial ban (1852–1978) that excluded Black saints from temple rites. Thus a movement born in communitarian aspiration reproduced settler hierarchies—an ambivalence Deleuze would call the "simultaneity of deterritorialisation and reterritorialisation."

## 5. Theocratic Kingdom and Mythic History

Parallel to economic communalism was an ambitious theocratic vision. Joseph Smith conceived a future "Kingdom of God" on earth, blending civil and sacred authority. In 1844 he organized the secret Council of Fifty, whose purpose was explicitly "to symbolize and represent a future theocratic or theodemocratic Kingdom of God on the earth". Smith even ran for U.S. President on a platform of restoring liberty under God. The Council's records speak of a coming millennial polity in which Christ would reign, and Smith foresaw Mormons governing a New Jerusalem. (LDS teaching held that during the Millennium Jesus will be "king of this new world government," whose structure was planned to be quasi-republican.) In 19th-century Mormon talk, America's Constitution was "of no worth" after the Millennium and the Saints would build Zion according to celestial law.

This messianic-political impulse was fundamentally mythic in Eliade's sense: it framed time as a cycle of sacred eras. Early Latter-day Saints saw themselves living out the dramatis personae of scriptures (Book of Mormon, Bible, Revelation). The temple endowment ceremony, introduced in Nauvoo, reenacted the Edenic creation, the fall, and the gathering of Israel – literally bringing the preterrestrial "plan of salvation" into ritual time. Eliade would note that such rituals create an eternal return to primordial time; indeed LDS temples were designed as terrestrial reflections of heaven (the Salt Lake Temple as an axis mundi in the city). Adam's story, Elijah's powers, and the eventual return of Enoch and Zion were all taught as imminent realities. In short, early Mormonism was steeped in mythic cosmology – a sacred history that unfolded across ages (pre-existence, mortality, Millennium) rather than the linear demystified history of Enlightenment Protestantism.

## 6. Comparative Interlude

### 6.1 State Shinto and Imperial Theosis

Meiji leaders nationalised Shinto in 1868, enthroning the Emperor as living deity to mobilise agrarian subjects for industrial empire. Like Mormonism, State Shinto used genealogy (sun-descended Tennō) and temple ritual to sacralise settlement (Hokkaidō) and communal labour. Both projects fused myth with colonisation, but where State Shinto enforced hierarchy, early Mormonism preached lay theosis and voluntary consecration.

### 6.2 God-Building under Soviet Socialism

Lunacharsky's bogostroitel'stvo sought an atheist civic cult harnessing ritual and myth for proletarian uplift. Mormon temple liturgy—with its Masonic dramas and covenantal oaths—already performed a similar myth-engineering, but in a theistic register. Both movements reveal how modern projects—imperial, socialist, or sectarian—turn to new theurgies when Enlightenment rationality proves cold.

## 7. Routinizing Revelation: From Charisma to Bureaucracy

Marxist and Weberian theory illuminate how this cosmic, radical movement then transformed into a modern institution. Weber described how "charismatic" movements must institutionalize or perish. Mormon history epitomizes this: after Smith's martyrdom the church faced the Weberian task of translating "ground-breaking and world-making revelations into a set of handbooks and teacher's manuals". By the late 19th century Brigham Young and successors turned the church into a bureaucratic organization. Revelation was disciplined into coded scriptures (Doctrine & Covenants) and rules; the living prophet's role was reserved to a First Presidency with a quorum of twelve apostles; local government and education came under church auspices. The charismatic frenzy of Missouri or Kirtland was tamed by new legitimacy claims: prophetic heritage, scriptural canon, and sacred ordinances.

The 20th century saw further routinization. Under leaders like David O. McKay and especially during the "Era of Standardization" (circa 1960s–70s), the Church consolidated authority into a global bureaucracy. A correlation program systematized all lesson manuals, budgets, and publications under priesthood oversight. As one insider laments, this "huge effort…to amass all leadership, budgets, publications, and teaching materials under one hierarchical…umbrella" sought uniformity at the cost of doctrinal breadth. Decentralized "rogue" sermons and local folklore were largely stamped out, replaced by bland, centrally approved curriculum. In Weberian terms, the Mormon church became a textbook case of the routinization of charisma: spiritual spontaneity gave way to legal-rational authority and bureaucratic order.

By the 1970s the transformation was complete: LDS worship and practice were almost entirely standardized worldwide. Lavish temples and tabernacles proliferated globally, but their rituals and furnishings became homogeneous. The exuberant, apocalyptic message of early leaders – about common lands, imminent kingdoms, and Adam-God – was toned down or quietly abandoned. The Church's own historical narratives were sanitized (e.g. polygamy minimized, Adam-God officially denounced). Instead, the focus shifted to individual family and corporate success. In worship services, a modest "Restoration" message emphasizing the familiar themes of family, faith, and work ethic replaced the old radicalism.

## 8. Self-Colonization and Neoliberal Accommodation

This institutional drift can be seen as a kind of self-colonization. Once a sect at odds with America, the LDS Church gradually colonized itself by internalizing prevailing bourgeois norms. Kathleen Flake calls the early-20th-century response to the Reed Smoot hearings "The Great Accommodation": facing scrutiny, Mormons adopted "the terms in which [the nation] would accept Mormonism". Senator Smoot became the image of the respectable Mormon – a patriotic, business-suit wearing apostle, not Brigham Young's bearded polygamist avatar. During WWI and WWII, Mormons "over-subscribed" their draft quotas to prove they were "superpatriotic," recasting themselves as model Americans. The Church publicly embraced patriotism, business success, and conservative morality (antivice campaigns), aligning with the mid-century Republican-Protestant consensus. The powerful LDS lobby even argued that Mormon welfare doctrines mirrored New Deal social gospel (rather than critique capitalism).

Under late 20th-century neoliberalism the accommodation became deeper. Mormon theology ceased to challenge capitalism; in fact, it sanctified free-market virtues. Brighamite wealth and self-reliance became doctrinal cornerstones, and overt class critique vanished. The Church accumulated corporate assets (insurance, real estate, media) and taught members entrepreneurship and home ownership. Social life was organized on family-centered, consumer lines (family home evenings, home building contests, college tuition subsidies) rather than communal sharing. Religious identity became aestheticized and privatized: ritual practice still rich, but its revolutionary edge removed. In Benjaminian terms, what was once a politically charged, communal mythology has turned into a kind of apolitical "civil religion" – scripture and temple life lend an aura of sacred order, but the aim is conformity and unity rather than liberation.

## 9. From Kingdom of God to Corporation of the President

Railroads, federal anti-polygamy campaigns, and the 1890 Manifesto forced Utah's integration. By the mid-20th century the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had become one of America's wealthiest corporations, investing in media, insurance, and global real estate. The communal Orders were replaced by tithing and for-profit subsidiaries; polygamy was renounced; racial bans persisted until 1978. Mumford's "megamachine" triumphs: the church now operates data centers and maintains an online genealogy empire—redeeming the dead with cloud computing rather than agrarian commons. Cosmic optimism survives, but the cooperative economy has been thoroughly reterritorialised by finance capital.

The result is a world-shrinking LDS trajectory. Where Joseph Smith once envisioned multiple worlds and theocracy, the modern Church offers a world-now model: local congregations in every nation, a universally rationalized organizational chart, and an emphasis on personal salvation and social conservatism. Orthodox Mormonism today reproduces mainstream norms (middle-class domesticity, entrepreneurial drive, bureaucratic governance) far more than it seeks to expand cosmic horizons. The utopian Zion has been replaced by ward council meetings; millennial anticipation is channeled into temple attendance quotas. In the language of religious sociology, early Mormonism's maximally enchanted, anti-capitalist orientation has been largely subsumed by a neoliberal-capitalist logic of self-improvement and institutional stability.

Nonetheless, echoes of the old dispensation survive in the Church's rhetoric of hope and unity. Terms like "Zion" and "eternal progression" remain in hymnals, and welfare service recalls communal beginnings. Yet these now coexist with (and often serve) an ethos of conformity. The Mormon journey from world-expanding prophet-dream to world-normalizing bureaucracy mirrors a broader pattern: radical religious movements often start by imagining a radically different cosmos, only to end by settling into the contours of the prevailing social order.

## 10. Conclusion: A Dialectical Legacy

Early Mormonism dramatises a recurring theme in this book: attempts to re-enchant and re-common the world under capitalist pressure. Smith's material cosmology and the United Orders were genuine gestures toward what Benjamin called "the weak messianic power" of the oppressed. Yet patriarchal and racial exclusions, plus the irresistible pull of westward markets, foreclosed the most radical possibilities. Today, LDS humanitarianism and missionary networks mirror neoliberal NGO logic, while temple theology still whispers the old promise of godhood. Mormonism thus stands as a dialectical image—at once a frontier socialism and a template for corporate religion—offering both caution and inspiration to contemporary movements seeking to reclaim myth and economics from the dead hand of capital.

Early Mormonism's radical cosmic re-enchantment and communal economy gave way, in the era of correlation and globalization, to a corporate structure and aestheticized faith aligned with late modern capitalism. This arc—from prophets who sought to overthrow old orders to a Church that upholds them—illustrates both the transformative potential of religion and its capacity for self-domestication in modern society.
