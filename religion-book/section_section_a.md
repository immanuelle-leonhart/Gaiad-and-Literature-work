# Section A

==Version 1==
## Introduction to Alpha

In this section of the book, I am going to be talking mostly about gods. I specifically am not going to use the term "religion" at any point during this section. I apologize, especially if you are reading an edition of this book that is not in English, as this may translate poorly. I am going to be avoiding the word religion throughout this entire section. This is a very intentional choice on my part, because I see religion as a problematic concept that is used very inconsistently and generally originates from political contexts.

Religion, as a concept, comes from the application of Christian categories—particularly those forged during the Catholic-Protestant conflict—onto the rest of the world. It is not a useful analytical tool here. While I will use the word "religion" frequently in later parts of this book, I will only do so in quotation marks and as a rhetorical necessity, not as a coherent category.

Abandoning the term "religion" makes this section more difficult to write. If I used it, I could easily refer to many topics—prophets, rituals, divinities—with the expectation that the reader would fill in the blanks with their own understandings. But that is precisely the problem: those understandings differ. The fluency of using the word masks the hard philosophical questions beneath. When someone hears that "Zarathustra founded the religion of Zoroastrianism," they might imagine a preacher gathering followers, a prophet writing scripture, a madman, or even a deal with the devil. It's a statement overloaded with projection.

Instead, I will say that Zarathustra founded Zoroastrianism. That is enough. The rest will be explored in due time.

As a polytheist, I will be expressing what may seem to some readers to be a surprisingly positive view of monotheistic traditions. And yes, I am calling them traditions, not religions. I will not use the term religion in this section for Christianity, Judaism, or any other tradition. This is not a dismissal of them—it is an effort to escape a flawed framework.

Words like "dharma" (Hindi), "deen" (Arabic), "religio" (Latin), and especially "shūkyō" (Japanese) are often translated as religion, but they do not share a common meaning. "Shūkyō" in particular is a modern term. It was not traditionally used in Japanese but was coined in the 19th century to satisfy treaty obligations with Western powers. Before this, Japan had no general word for "religion"—and arguably no need for one.

Many pagans—by which I mean modern pagans, not ancient ones—are angry at Christianity, and many are also angry at Judaism, although often in a more oblique or repressed way. There is a popular narrative among some pagans that Christianity violently destroyed the polytheistic traditions of the West, and that Judaism either seeded or enabled that destruction. Progressive pagans sometimes respond by reinterpreting Judaism as not truly monotheistic or as benignly non-proselytizing, but I think this is often politically motivated. It is socially unacceptable in progressive circles to attack Judaism, due to its associations with Nazi persecution, and so criticism is deflected or subdued. Yet modern paganism is a modern identity; it has more in common with modern Christianity than with ancient polytheism.

The so-called paganism of Homer is vastly different from the late paganism of Julian the Apostate. The Christianity of Constantine is likewise extremely different from that of Martin Luther—or of a present-day Christian. In fact, the Christianity of Constantine has more in common with the paganism of Julian than either does with their imagined forebears. That’s the tragedy. Christianity did not simply take over the Roman Empire—it absorbed and restructured a failing paganism. The real culprits in the fall of Roman polytheism were not Christians, but pagans themselves.

If your model of pagan revival is Julian or Plotinus or Iamblichus, you're already halfway down the road to Christianity. And that’s fine—if you understand what you’re doing. But it’s important to admit.

In this book, I am going to tell six stories. Each story is about how one civilization came into confrontation with monotheism—some survived, some didn't. While these cultures were in contact with one another, I will treat their transitions primarily as internal developments.

1. Egypt and Atenism
1. Israel and Judaism
1. Persia and Zoroastrianism
1. Rome and Christianity
1. China and Buddhism
1. Japan and Shinto

Egypt resisted the total loss of its gods, delaying it for millennia. China and Japan are, in my view, rare success stories—civilizations that managed to integrate external religious forces while preserving their native polytheism. Other regions—like the Americas, the Philippines, and even parts of Europe—lost their gods more violently, through conquest and forced conversion.

These six case studies are not the only ones that matter. But they are the ones I know best. And they will help illustrate what god-worshipping is, how it emerges, and how it survives.

## Version 3


In this section, I avoid the term "religion" altogether. I do this because it is not a neutral word—it emerged in the European context, forged in the conflicts between Catholicism and Protestantism, and then exported globally under colonial and diplomatic pressures. For example, the Japanese word for religion, "shūkyo" (宗教), is a modern compound created during treaty negotiations with the United States and had no fixed meaning beforehand. Similarly, Arabic *dīn*, Sanskrit *dharma*, Latin *religio*, and other words often translated as "religion" were historically deployed in far more specific or culturally contingent ways.

By refusing the word "religion" here, I am not trying to make things difficult. On the contrary, I want to make things clear. If I were to use the word, we could easily fall into familiar patterns of assumption, interpretation, and dismissal. Readers could slot ideas into preexisting categories without really listening. What I want instead is reflection, wonder, and openness.

For example, saying that "Zarathustra founded the religion of Zoroastrianism" suggests an entire framework of beliefs, institutions, and criteria. But simply saying "Zarathustra founded Zoroastrianism" focuses attention on the event and the person without invoking that entire semantic system. The former statement invites projection; the latter invites inquiry.

This is especially important because many modern pagans or polytheists define themselves in contrast to Christianity or Judaism. Some are overtly hostile to Christianity for its role in dismantling Greco-Roman or European indigenous systems. Some are ambivalent or idealize Judaism. But the truth is more complex. The paganism of Julian the Apostate was already vastly different from the polytheism of Homer. And the Christianity of Constantine was far closer to Julian's religion than it was to Martin Luther's, just as modern Christians and pagans often have more in common with each other than with their supposed ideological ancestors.

I do not see Christianity as something that "defeated" paganism. I see paganism as having already weakened itself. The problem, then, is not simply Christianity, but a broader shift in how gods were seen, honored, and remembered.

The six stories that I tell in this book—Egypt (Atenism), Israel (Judaism), Persia (Zoroastrianism), Rome (Christianity), China (Buddhism), and Japan (Shinto)—represent different pathways that god-worship took. Some lost their gods. Others preserved them. Others transformed them.
