# Charter of Ecumenical Polytheism

Author: Immanuelle Leonhart

Purpose

Polytheism has existed throughout all cultures since the dawn of time. It is in human nature to recognize the fundamental plurality of the divine which cannot be reduced into one. From the earliest cave paintings to the grand monuments of ancient civilizations, people have honored millions of gods, and there are millions more yet to be found.

We are not here to promote polytheism. Polytheism does not need promotion. It is the default of humanity. What we are here to do is to bring polytheism back into public life. Be it ancient gods, new gods, or gods people do not realize are gods, all gods deserve worship.

In authoritarian hubris, empires sought to deny this fact and ban the worship of most or all gods. Yet the people never truly stopped believing. They kept their faiths, and even found new gods underground. And their faiths, our faiths are growing as we realize we are not alone.

For this reason, we—the Polytheist Association—operate on an ecumenical polytheism that treats all gods with respect. The purpose of this organization is not to promote any one belief system but to build a platform allowing existing polytheisms to retake their rightful place in public life.

Organizational structure

We will establish a network of local shrines and regional temples, each holding its own autonomy while contributing to a shared, collaborative structure. A shrine will be a small facility—potentially beginning as a single household altar or a modest public site—dedicated to one god or a closely related group of gods. Every shrine will be overseen by a priest who documents its sacred lineage, rituals, and relics. Because many contemporary polytheistic practices have remained hidden or private, we recognize homes as entirely valid starting points for shrines, with the longer-term goal of returning open worship to public spaces.

Beyond these local shrines, we will create regional temples that serve as central hubs uniting and supporting multiple shrines within a given area. These temples will function much like community centers, hosting larger festivals, providing training for new priests, and safeguarding sacred objects if a smaller shrine must close. Each temple will also enshrine the gods honored throughout its region, ensuring every deity has a public place of reverence. This layered, decentralized structure will promote local autonomy—allowing practitioners to honor their gods in ways most meaningful to them—while fostering collective collaboration through shared resources, community-building, and the exchange of knowledge.

Establishing a shrine

If you have a personal practice and want to invite others into a shared, public expression of devotion, founding a shrine will be your next step. **Shrines** are the foundation of the Polytheist Association—not individual believers—because our goal is to cultivate living traditions and honor the gods, rather than claim ownership of human minds or private beliefs.

If you carry an interesting history of practice, or if your path reflects a unique syncretism, we encourage you to **document** it and create a shrine that brings your devotion into the public sphere.

**Basic Requirements for a Shrine**:

1. **Designated Space** – You will select a specific location for your shrine, which may begin as a dedicated area in your home.
1. **Relic or Sacred Object** – You will identify a tangible focal point that houses or represents the deity (or deities) you wish to honor.
1. **Open Access (Upon Request)** – While full public hours may not be feasible initially, you will ensure there is a way for community members or visitors to request entry.
1. **Annual Festival** – You will designate at least one day per year for a festival celebrating the shrine’s deity, inviting the local community to gather and participate.
1. **Lineage Documentation** – You will record any relevant background of your deity or practice, including where the relic came from and how you came to honor this particular god or gods.
1. **Pilgrim’s Mark** – You will provide a physical calligraphic mark to be written in the pilgrimage diaries of visitors. This will help bring in revenue and encourage people to go on pilgrimages to many shrines in a local area.
1. **Coordination with the local temple** – You must coordinate with the local temple. This will be covered more in the upcoming Temples section.

By meeting these essential points, you will help weave your shrine into the broader **network** of polytheistic worship. In time, should you or your community outgrow the home-based setup, your shrine may evolve into a more established public venue, strengthening both your local circle of practitioners and our collective movement for public polytheism.

You are encouraged to monetize the shrine. Incorporate it as a nonprofit and make it self sustaining. Because this is a necessary part to help bring polytheism into public life rather than remaining as small personal practice. 

## Relics
Relics are the tangible focal points through which the presence of a deity is acknowledged and made accessible. They may be naturally occurring objects (like a revered stone or sacred tree) or crafted items (such as statues, mirrors, or tokens). In some cases, even a living being—human or animal—can serve as a relic if it embodies divine power or lineage. Whichever form they take, relics provide a concrete anchor for devotion, bridging the intangible presence of a god with the material world. This not only helps worshipers focus their reverence but also preserves a sense of continuity; when you record the origin and history of a relic, you link today’s practice to both past traditions and future generations.

Here are the four types of relics
----

### 1. Immovable Natural Object
These relics are part of the natural environment—sacred landmarks such as mountains, trees, or rock formations. By virtue of their sheer presence and history, they have come to embody a deity, acting as a profound spiritual anchor in the landscape.

- **Sacred Mountains** (e.g., Mount Fuji)
- **Sacred Rocks** (e.g., Uluru/Ayers Rock, Meoto Iwa, Acasta Gneiss)
- **Ancient Trees** (e.g., Methuselah bristlecone pine, Pando)
- **Rivers or Lakes** (e.g., Mississippi River)
- **Burial Mounds** (e.g., Kofun in Japan)
- **Celestial bodies** (e.g., Praise the Sun)
- **Buildings or Institutions** (e.g., The New York Public Library, The Capitol building)

----

### 2. Movable Object
These relics are portable, allowing them to be carried to new sites or enshrined indoors. Craftsmanship and consecration often play a key role, transforming everyday items into divinely charged objects.

- **Statues/Idols** (e.g., Honzon Buddha statues)
- **Swords**
- **Mirrors**
- **Magatama (sacred jewels)**
- **Body parts or belongings of saints**

----

### 3. Living Vessel (Human)
In this form, the deity resides in a human being who serves as a conduit of divine presence. Often, these individuals belong to a lineage or undergo specific training or consecration.

- **Priests/Clergy with Holy Spirit Transmission** (e.g., Catholic or Mormon)
- **Dharma Transmission** (e.g., certain Buddhist lineages)
- **Inspired Oracles** (e.g., the Ōhōri of Suwa-taisha Kamisha)

----

### 4. Sacred Animal
Some traditions revere living animals or plants as direct embodiments of a deity. Whether through mythic origin stories or ongoing ritual practices, these beings are cherished as integral, animated manifestations of the divine.

- **Apis Bull** (Memphis in ancient Egypt)
- **Sacred Crocodiles** (Crocodilopolis)
- **Temple Rats** (Karni Mata Temple)
- **Sacred Cows** (various regions in India)

Temples

A **Temple** is essentially a **shrine in a local area** that has been **elected** or recognized to serve a broader public and administrative role. While our ultimate aim is for these temples to occupy more visible, publicly accessible locations, they may begin in someone’s residence if necessary. Over time, as resources and community engagement grow, these temples can expand to meet the needs of the region.

**Core Functions**

1. **Pantheon Shrine**
#* Within each temple, there will be a dedicated **pantheon shrine** that enshrines or **preserves backup relics** for the deities of its region—**but only for movable objects**.
#* This ensures that if a smaller shrine closes or relocates, the deity’s presence remains safeguarded until a new shrine can be established.
1. **Centralized Training**
#* **Every year, priests** from local shrines will attend a **training session** at the temple, refining their skills in ritual procedure, recordkeeping, and other communal duties.
#* This helps maintain consistency and quality across all shrines in the region.
#* A Temple can help people set up their own shrines for their own traditions, or help someone “adopt” a shrine whose priest was unable to continue their duties
1. **Regional Administration**
#* Because a temple is recognized as a regional hub, it coordinates **larger festivals** or multi-shrine events and facilitates communication among local priests.
#* By holding this position, the temple eases the administrative burden on individual shrine keepers.
1. **Elected Status**
#* A temple’s status is not solely about size or grandeur; rather, **local consensus** or formal selection grants a particular shrine the responsibilities of a temple.
#* Although we encourage establishing temples in public, easy-to-access spaces, a home-based temple remains legitimate if it effectively serves its regional duties.

In this way, temples become indispensable **community centers**, uniting local shrines, safeguarding movable relics, and providing structured training. They stand at the crossroads between **private devotion** and the broader **public life** of polytheism, ensuring continuity, collaboration, and ongoing communal growth.

Documentation and Preservation

Every shrine carries its own **unique story**, reflecting the culture, history, and lineage of the gods it serves. In keeping with our commitment to celebrate and honor this diversity, we will create a **centralized digital archive** to preserve and share these stories with the world.

1. **Public Online Registry**
#* We will develop a **website** cataloging each shrine’s background, its deity (or deities), and the lineage or origin of its relic.
#* All shrines will be listed here, including branch shrines, so visitors can easily trace lineages back to their sources.
1. **Interactive Tools and App**
#* We intend to create a **user-friendly app** that allows travelers, pilgrims, or curious individuals to **locate shrines**, request visits, and even donate directly if they wish.
#* The app will be **optional** and **open-source**, ensuring that nobody is required to use it to participate in Ecumenical Polytheism.
1. **Periodic Publications**
#* We plan to **publish a comprehensive book** on a regular schedule, compiling information on active shrines, their stories, and any significant developments.
#* This ensures a physical record remains available for posterity, even if digital systems fail or are inaccessible.
1. **Translation Efforts**
#* As a central organization, we will **translate key information** about each shrine into the official languages of the Polytheist Association (English, Japanese, French, Spanish, and Chinese).
#* While we encourage shrines to share or translate any scriptures or extensive teachings they may have, we will focus primarily on **basic shrine data**—deity names, origin stories, and lineage details—to keep the process manageable.
1. **Library Partnerships**
#* Regional temples or local libraries may **host physical collections** of any scriptures, texts, or artifacts that belong to individual shrines.
#* Where feasible, we will also work on **translating** essential materials so that interested practitioners and researchers worldwide can learn from these unique traditions.
#* We do not have scripture. But shrines and temples may have their own scriptures.

By **preserving** and **documenting** every shrine’s story, we will ensure the **continuity** of diverse polytheistic practices, allowing future generations to explore their heritage and embrace the divine multiplicity that has always been humanity’s birthright.

Conclusion

We stand at a turning point where centuries of overlooked or suppressed polytheistic traditions are returning to public life. The Polytheist Association’s **ecumenical approach** seeks not to amalgamate these diverse faiths, but to provide them with the **space, support, and recognition** they deserve. Through the **establishment of local shrines and regional temples,** the careful preservation of **relics** and **lineages,** and open platforms for **documentation** and **education,** we are forging a living tapestry of devotion—one that honors **every** god, whether ancient, newly emerged, or yet to be widely recognized.

We invite all those who share our vision to **join us**: build or adopt a shrine, celebrate festivals that fill neighborhoods with song and community spirit, and preserve the stories that keep our gods alive. Working together, we will ensure that **plurality of the divine** thrives in the public sphere, carrying our collective traditions forward into a bright, expansive future.
