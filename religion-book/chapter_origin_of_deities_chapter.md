1. The Evolving Concept of “God” Across Cultures
Understanding how different cultures conceive of “god” requires examining both the **linguistic roots** of the term and the **conceptual shifts** over time. This report compares the Indo-European and Japanese developments in detail, then surveys Chinese, Uralic, Semitic, and Egyptian terms for deity. We will see recurring themes – such as sky gods, ancestor spirits, and cosmic order – that emerge as human societies evolved.

## Indo-European Origins of “God”
In Indo-European languages, several distinct root words for “god” emerged in antiquity. The four most commonly cited Proto-Indo-European (PIE) roots reflect different aspects of divinity:

- *'Sky/Light (*deiwos'') – the “Shining Sky” gods
- *'Ritual/Spiritual (*dʰeh₁- / *dhes-'') – the “Sacred/Consecrated” gods
- *'Invocation/Sacrifice (*ǵhau- / *gheu-'') – the gods as recipients of libation or invocation
- *'Dispensing Fortune (*bʰag'') – the gods as givers of wealth or fate

### *Dyēus: Sky and Light
One ancient PIE word for god, *deiwos*, literally meant “celestial” or “shining” – essentially the bright sky​[^cite_1](^cite_1). The word is related to the english word "day".
. This root gave rise to words for a **sky deity** across Indo-European cultures. For example:

- **Latin *deus*** – meaning “god” in Classical Latin, from PIE *deiwos*[^cite_2](^cite_2). It originally referred to a shining celestial power, cognate with the name of the chief Indo-European sky god (*Dyēus*). In Roman religion *deus* was a generic term for any deity[^cite_3](^cite_3). Only later, in Late Latin, did *Deus* become used primarily for the Christian God<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus#:~:text=In%20Classical%20Latin%20%2C%20,Irish%20and%20Scottish%20Gaelic%20Dia

</ref>
- **Sanskrit *deva*** – meaning a god or shining one, likewise from *deiwos*. In Vedic tradition, *Deva* referred to the beneficent gods (like **Dyaus** the sky-father, **Varuna**, **Indra**), in contrast to Asuras.
- **Greek Zeus** – the name of the sky father god (Zeus < *Dyēus*). Greek retained *Zeus* as a proper name for the chief god, but did not use it as a common noun for “god.” Instead, Greek developed a new word (theos; see below). *Zeus* is a true cognate of Latin *Deus*[^cite_4](^cite_4)[^cite_5](^cite_5), both tracing back to the PIE “Sky-Father” (*Dyēus Ph₂tḗr*, “Father Sky”[^cite_6](^cite_6)). Other descendants of this Sky-Father title include Vedic **Dyauṣ Pitṛ́**, Latin **Jupiter** (*Iūpiter* < *Djous patēr*), and Old Norse **Týr**[^cite_7](^cite_7)

In early Indo-European belief, this sky god was often envisioned as a fatherly figure associated with daylight, the heavens, and cosmic order. The **literal meaning** of *Dyēus* as “daylight-sky”​[^cite_8](^cite_8)reflects how the deity was essentially the personified sky. Over time, words from this root (*deus*, *deva*, etc.) became generic terms for any deity or the concept of the divine, especially as religions evolved from sky worship to more complex pantheons.

### *Dʰeh₁- (Theos): Ritual and Sacred Space
The **ancient Greek word *theós* (θεός)**, meaning “god,” has a different origin. Despite its surface similarity to *deus*, the two are **false cognates**[^cite_9](^cite_9). *Theos* comes not from the sky-god root, but likely from PIE *dʰeh₁-* (“to put, to place”) with a suffix, forming *dʰéh₁-s-*[^cite_10](^cite_10). This root carried a sense of **“doing or placing (in a sacred manner)”**, and it underlies words related to ritual and festivals. Cognates of Greek *theos* include Latin *fēriae* “holidays” and *fānum* “temple,” as well as Latin *festus* “festive”[^cite_11](^cite_11). This suggests that *theos* originally connoted **“that which is worshipped or consecrated”**, essentially a being of ritual significance.

Greek religion replaced the old sky-word for god (Zeus) with *theos* as the generic term for deity, broadening the concept beyond the sky-father alone. Notably, *theos* was often used in plural (*theoi*, “the gods”). The term carried an implication of **numinous power** – for example, the Greek root appears in words like *enthousiasmos* (“being possessed/inspired by a god”)​[^cite_12](^cite_12). This highlights how gods were seen as powerful forces that could inhabit or inspire individuals (sometimes causing ecstasy or even madness, as with the root of English *enthusiastic*[^cite_13](^cite_13)).

In summary, the PIE *dhes- line (Greek *theos*) reflects a conceptualization of gods **not primarily as sky beings, but as powers encountered in worship and sacred places**. The enduring use of *theos* (and its derivatives like *theology*, *atheism*, etc.) in Western languages underscores the legacy of this concept of deity as *“the object of devotion or festival.”*[^cite_14](^cite_14)[^cite_15](^cite_15)​

### Germanic *Gud: Invocation and Sacrifice
The Germanic languages’ word for god (Old English *god*, Old Norse *guð*, Gothic *gudja*, etc.) has a debated etymology. Early Germanic paganism was polytheistic, and tellingly, **only a plural form existed originally** – there was no singular “God” until later religious changes​[^cite_16](^cite_16)[^cite_17](^cite_17). The plural *gods* (Proto-Germanic *guðániz*) was neuter in gender, used for a broad class of supernatural beings[^cite_18](^cite_18)
.
Etymologists have proposed two main PIE roots for *god* (Germanic *ǥuđán*):

- ***ǵhau-** “to call, invoke”: one theory links *god* to a Sanskrit term for invocation (such as **huta** “invoked [one](one)”)​[^cite_19](^cite_19). On this view, *god* would mean *“the one who is invoked (in prayer).”*
- ***gheu-** “to pour (a libation)”: the more widely accepted theory today is that *god* comes from the idea of pouring a sacrifice​[^cite_20](^cite_20). In many Indo-European rituals, offerings were poured out to the gods. Thus *god* could mean *“the one to whom sacrifices are poured,”* essentially *“the libation-worthy being.”* Modern scholars favor this derivation, interpreting “to pour” in the context of sacrificial rites[^cite_21](^cite_21)

Both theories reflect the act of **worship** – calling upon or offering to a deity. In either case, the Germanic concept of *god* is tied to **human interaction with the divine** (invocation or sacrifice) rather than a description of the deity’s form (unlike “sky” or “shining” in other roots).

It’s worth noting that some scholars have even speculated *god* might not derive from any Indo-European root at all but from a pre-Germanic substrate language​[^cite_22](^cite_22). However, lacking evidence of such a source, the invocation/pouring origin remains the standard explanation. After the conversion of Germanic peoples to Christianity, *God* with a capital G became the singular, masculine term for the one supreme deity. This was essentially a repurposing of the old plural word: *“the singular was abstracted from the plural, and the neuter yielded to the masculine”* for the Christian context[^cite_23](^cite_23).

**Conceptual development:** In pagan times, Germanic *gods* were a multitude of local spirits and deities (making people “giddy” or possessed, as Old English *gydig* implies​[^cite_24](^cite_24)). With Christianization, *God* came to signify an **all-good, singular Creator**, quite a shift from the earlier fearsome or mischievous spirits. (Importantly, despite the similarity in English, *god* is **not** related to *good*[^cite_25](^cite_25)[^cite_26](^cite_26); folk etymology had linked them, but historical linguistics shows *good* has a different origin entirely.)

### Slavic *Bogŭ: Dispenser of Fortune
Slavic languages use a root *bogŭ* (Old Church Slavonic *bogŭ*, Russian *Bog*, Polish *Bóg*, etc.) for “god.” This word is **etymologically linked to the idea of fortune, wealth, or apportionment**. It is generally accepted that Slavic *bog* was borrowed from Indo-Iranian (likely Scythian or Sarmatian) *bhaga*, a word meaning *“distributor”* or *“lord of shares/fortune”*[^cite_27](^cite_27). In the Vedic Sanskrit context, **Bhaga** is indeed a deity who grants wealth and prosperity, and the Sanskrit noun *bhaga* meant “portion” or “lot” (hence fortune)[^cite_28](^cite_28).

Evidence of this origin is that Slavic *bogŭ* is cognate with words for wealth: e.g. Russian *bogat* (“rich”) and Sanskrit **Bhagavān** (an epithet of God meaning “possessor of fortune”) share the same root​[^cite_29](^cite_29). A scholarly summary notes: *“Slavic bog (‘god’) and bogatyj (‘rich’) are generally seen as loanwords from Iranian,”* linked to a deity distributing prosperity[^cite_30](^cite_30).

**Conceptually**, the Slavic *bog* suggests a god as a **benefactor or patron** – one who gives wealth, good luck, or blessings. In pre-Christian Slavic religion, *Bog* may not have been the name of a specific god but rather a general term (possibly influenced by the reverence of a “Lord” of plenty). When Slavic peoples converted to Christianity, *Bog* straightforwardly became the term for the one God, now viewed as the source of all blessings. The old meaning survives in subtle ways: for instance, to say “thank you” in Russian (*spasibo*) originally meant “[may](may) God save [you](you)” and Polish *Bóg* remains the word for the Christian God. The core idea of **God as provider** underlies this term’s evolution, from pagan fortune-bestower to the almighty Providence in Christian thought.

### Summary of Indo-European Developments
Across the Indo-European family, we see that **different facets of divinity** were emphasized in different branches:

- The **Sky-Father and shining celestial** aspect (*dyeus*) gave words like *deus, deva*, emphasizing glory and heaven. This often correlates with fatherly or ruler-of-sky roles in myth (Zeus, Jupiter, Dyaus).
- The **Sacred rite** aspect (*dhes*) gave Greek *theos*, framing gods as those invested with sanctity, tied to temples and festivals – gods defined by worship and awe rather than by location in the sky.
- The **Invocation/Sacrifice** aspect (*ghu-*) gave Germanic *god*, defining gods by human action toward them (calling, offering). This highlights early Germanic gods as beings of appeasement and interaction.
- The **Fortune/Lord** aspect (*bhag*) gave Slavic *bog*, defining god as a generous master of fate – reflective of a social structure where the deity is like a feudal lord dispensing bounty (and where wealth itself was seen as divine favor).

Despite these varied origins, as Indo-European cultures moved into the Common Era (and especially under the influence of Christianity), many of these terms converged in meaning. Latin *Deus*, Greek *Theos*, Germanic *God*, and Slavic *Bog* all came to be used to denote the one Judaeo-Christian God by the Middle Ages. Yet the **older, plural, and context-specific senses** often persisted in mythology, language, and folk culture. For example, English still uses “gods” in a mythological or figurative sense, and words like “deity” (from Latin *deus*) or “divine” (*dīvus*, from *deiwos*) carry the original PIE sense of “shining/exalted.” Meanwhile, “enthuse/enthusiastic” carry the legacy of Greek *theos* (to be filled with a god’s spirit), and “to bless” in Slavic languages (Russian *blagoslovit’*, “speak a good [word](word)”) echoes the connection between goodness and the favor of *Bog*. These echoes remind us that the concept of “god” in Indo-European traditions was **multifaceted from the start** – encompassing the vault of heaven, the sacred rites, the act of worship, and the blessings of fortune.

## Japanese Conceptions of “Kami”
In contrast to Indo-European sky fathers and thunder gods, the **Japanese concept of “god” (神, *kami*)** developed in an animistic and Shintō context that is quite distinct. The Japanese term *kami* does **not** neatly translate to the Western notion of a single omnipotent God. Instead, *kami* refers broadly to **spirits or deities, a myriad of invisible forces or beings that inspire awe**.

### Etymology and Meaning of *Kami*
The word *kami* in Japanese is written with the character 神 (which was borrowed from Chinese *shén*, “spirit/god”). In the indigenous Japanese reading, *kami* can be understood as **“divine spirit”** in the widest sense. Historical linguists have long debated the origin of the word. A popular folk etymology ties *kami* to the word *kami* (上) meaning “above” or “high up.” In the 14th century, scholars like Inbe no Masamichi noted that *kami* (deity) is homonymous with *kami* (above) and reasoned that **“kami refers to what is above”**, since the gods dwell in the High Plain of Heaven in mythology​[^cite_31](^cite_31)[^cite_32](^cite_32). This idea – *“kami = that which is above (superior)”* – gained wide currency by the Edo period[^cite_33](^cite_33).

Modern scholarship, however, suggests this is a coincidence of homophones. The characters for “above” (上) and “god” (神) are read the same, but likely have **different etymological origins**[^cite_34](^cite_34). Motoori Norinaga, an 18th-century Shintō scholar, famously argued that trying to derive the meaning of *kami* from its phonetic components was misguided[^cite_35](^cite_35). He asserted that only by observing usage in texts can one grasp what *kami* truly means. Norinaga’s definition, now classic, is that:<blockquote>**“In general, *kami* refers first to the myriad *kami* of heaven and earth we see in the ancient classics, and the spirits (*mitama*) enshrined in shrines dedicated to them. Further, it refers to all awe-inspiring things — not only the noble, good, or virtuous, but also anything evil or strange that arouses awe — are called *kami*.”**[^cite_36](^cite_36)
</blockquote>In other words, *kami* in Japanese are **any entities, phenomena, or beings that possess extraordinary power and inspire awe, reverence, or fear**[^cite_37](^cite_37). This could be a great deity like Amaterasu (the sun goddess) or a tiny spirit of a particular tree or rock. It includes natural forces (wind, thunder), natural objects (mountains, rivers), ancestral spirits of clan leaders, and even living people of remarkable charisma or danger.

Thus, unlike the more specific Indo-European terms, Japanese *kami* is a **fluid and inclusive term**. Everything from a benign harvest deity to a vengeful ghost might be *kami* if it has that ineffable quality of *takusu* (awe). Notably, *kami* can be plural or singular without change (Japanese has no plural ending for it) – often people speak of *yaoyorozu no kami*, “the eight million kami,” to mean countless deities/spirits.

### Historical Development of the *Kami* Concept
Japan’s earliest written records, the *Kojiki* (712 CE) and *Nihon Shoki* (720 CE), already contain a rich tapestry of *kami*. These texts recount how the islands of Japan and all their elemental features were created by the primordial kami Izanagi and Izanami, and how a multitude of kami (gods of wind, sea, fire, fields, etc., as well as ancestral deities of each clan) populated the world. The sun goddess **Amaterasu Ōmikami** is a central *kami*, ancestress of the imperial line. The very multiplicity of these tales shows that *kami* did not refer to a single supreme being but to **an ever-expanding collection of deities and spirits** connected to natural and social phenomena.

Over time, the concept of *kami* in Shintō religion maintained this broad inclusiveness. When Buddhism arrived in Japan (6th century CE), rather than displacing *kami*, it syncretized with them: Buddhas and bodhisattvas were seen as another kind of *kami* or conversely *kami* were seen as local manifestations of Buddhas (the theory of *honji suijaku*). The term *kami* thus extended to even include some foreign deities interpreted through a Japanese lens.

From the **linguistic perspective**, *kami* remained the native word for any deity or numinous entity. It had to stretch to cover the monotheistic concept when Christianity was later introduced. For example, 16th-century Christian missionaries in Japan (like Francis Xavier) used “Deus” (from Latin/Portuguese) for God; but eventually the Japanese language settled on *kami* (often with the honorific *-sama*) to translate the Christian God as well. Even today, in colloquial Japanese, *kamI-sama* can mean the singular God in Christian or Islamic contexts, while *kami* by itself might mean “a god/deity” or “the gods” generally.

**Importantly, the Japanese idea of *kami* differs from Indo-European “god” concepts in a few key ways:**

- *Kami* are often **localized** and **plural**. Each shrine has its own *saijin* (enshrined deity), and nature is full of *kami*. There isn’t a strict hierarchy with one creator god at the top (though the emperor was traditionally said to descend from the top *kami*, Amaterasu). In contrast, Indo-European pantheons often gravitated toward a chief sky god or a single creator figure over time. Shintō cosmology, however, is less about an omnipotent creator and more about the interplay of many forces.
- *Kami* include **ancestral spirits** to a notable degree. While ancestor worship exists in many cultures, in Japan the boundary between ancestor and deity is thin – e.g., legendary heroes or clan founders become enshrined as *kami*. (The Emperor himself was considered a living *kami* historically.) This is somewhat akin to the Roman practice of deifying emperors (*divus*)​[^cite_38](^cite_38), but in Japan it was broader and tied to indigenous beliefs about the afterlife and reverence for predecessors.
- Morality and goodness are not prerequisites to be a *kami*. As Norinaga noted, even evil or fearful beings (if powerful enough to awe) are *kami*[^cite_39](^cite_39). This concept hearkens back to a time when *kami* were essentially **wondrous or fearsome manifestations of nature and existence**, not exclusively moral governors or beneficent fathers. Indo-European sky gods, by contrast, often took on roles as **lawgivers or moral overseers** (e.g. Zeus with justice, Varuna with cosmic order). Shintō *kami* primarily maintain the harmony of nature and community (through rituals) but did not traditionally dictate ethical codes – that aspect in Japan was more influenced by Confucian and Buddhist thought.

In summary, *kami* developed as a concept alongside Japan’s unique religious culture. It retained an **animistic pluralism** – the world is alive with countless spirits – and did not crystallize into a single all-powerful deity. This fundamental difference is often highlighted by scholars:<blockquote>**“‘God’ as represented in the world of Abrahamic religions – a single being, creator of the world, transcendent – does not exist in Shintō. As an animist and polytheist religion, Shintō speaks rather of divine beings in many forms.”**[^cite_40](^cite_40)​</blockquote>Thus, any direct comparison between *kami* and, say, *deus* or *theos* must be made with caution. Linguistically, *kami* stands on its own, not known to be related to any other language’s word for god. Conceptually, it reminds us of an early stage in religious thought where **the divine is everywhere around us** – in the high mountains, the stormy seas, the ancestors’ spirits – an idea that, while present in ancient Indo-European paganism, was later overshadowed by more centralized deity concepts in the West.
