# Judaism chapter

Great. I’ll draft the beginning of your Judaism chapter with a focus on the tragic development of Jewish monotheism, centered on the cult of Yahweh. This will include the historical evolution of Yahweh from a warrior-storm god within a polytheistic milieu to the sole deity of monotheism, drawing on scholarly sources like Mark S. Smith, John Day, and others.

I’ll incorporate references to pre-Yahwistic Hebrew polytheism, the Ugaritic and Canaanite religious landscape, the impact of political collapse and exile, and the theological shifts embedded in biblical and archaeological evidence.

I’ll let you know as soon as a draft is ready for review.

1. The Tragic Development of Jewish Monotheism

## Polytheistic Beginnings in the Canaanite World

The story of Yahweh begins in a world of many gods. Early Israelite religion did not spring from a vacuum of pure monotheism; it emerged from the rich polytheistic milieu of the ancient Southern Levant. The Canaanite pantheon, well-known from Ugaritic texts, was headed by the high god *El* (a paternal creator figure) and his consort *Asherah*, alongside powerful deities like *Baal* (a young warrior-storm god), *Anat* (a fierce goddess of war), *Astarte* (a love and fertility goddess), and others. Early Israelites **worshipped Yahweh within this pantheon**, not as a solitary god but as one among many. In fact, archaeological and textual evidence strongly suggests that Israel’s earliest worship included these Canaanite gods as part of its heritage. Biblical writers themselves remember Terah, Abraham’s father, serving “other gods” beyond the Euphrates (Joshua 24:2), and throughout the pre-exilic period the average Israelite farmstead or village would have recognized multiple divine powers at work in the world. Recent scholarship by Mark S. Smith, John Day, and Ziony Zevit confirms that **ancient Israelite religion was largely Canaanite in origin**, meaning that the shift to exclusive Yahweh worship represented a dramatic break from Israel’s own past rather than from some entirely foreign influence. In short, **the earliest Israelites were polytheists**, and Yahweh was originally venerated alongside other gods and goddesses, not in isolation.

 [^cite_1](^cite_1) *Inscription from an 8th-century BCE jar found at Kuntillet Ajrud (Sinai) invoking “Yahweh and his Asherah.” Such finds indicate that Israelites in the monarchic period often **worshipped Yahweh together with a consort deity (Asherah)**, reflecting a blend of old Canaanite traditions within Yahweh’s cult [^cite_2](^cite_2) [^cite_3](^cite_3).*

One striking example of this early **religious pluralism** is the role of the goddess Asherah. In Canaanite myth, Asherah was the wife of El, the supreme god. Evidence suggests that Israelites likewise honored Asherah as a divine consort – presumably as the consort of Yahweh once Yahweh was identified with El. The Hebrew Bible preserves echoes of her veneration: poles or trees called *asherim* stood beside many altars, and at least one biblical tradition refers to the goddess as the “Queen of Heaven” worshipped by Judah’s women (Jeremiah 7:18, 44:17-19). Archaeologically, **inscriptions from Khirbet el-Qom and Kuntillet Ajrud** explicitly invoke “Yahweh and his Asherah,” implying the two were worshipped as a pair [^cite_4](^cite_4). Even centuries later, in the 5th century BCE, the Jewish community at Elephantine in Egypt had a temple to *Yahu* (Yahweh) that included the worship of a female deity named *Anat-Yahu*, likely a local form of Yahweh’s old consort [^cite_5](^cite_5). All this underscores that **for much of Israel’s early history, monotheism had not yet taken hold**. Yahweh was the *chief* god of Israel, but not the *only* god – an important member of a larger family of deities. As John Day succinctly put it, Yahweh’s **origins were distinct from those of El** of Ugarit, and only over time did Israelite theology merge the two figures into one. The elevation of Yahweh above other gods was a gradual, tension-filled process, not a starting assumption.

## Yahweh’s Emergence as a Southern Warrior Deity

How did Yahweh enter this pantheon in the first place? Both biblical and extrabiblical evidence point to **Yahweh’s origins outside the land of Canaan**, in the arid southern regions. The Bible preserves memories of Yahweh coming from *Seir*, *Edom*, or *Mount Paran* (e.g. Judges 5:4, Deuteronomy 33:2), regions to the south of Israel. This aligns with ancient Egyptian inscriptions that mention a group called the “Shasu of **YHW**,” apparently referring to a tribe or region devoted to Yahweh, in the deserts of Edom/Seir [^cite_6](^cite_6). Notably, a 14th-century BCE topographical list from the temple of Soleb (built by Pharaoh Amenhotep III) includes a place named “tꜣ šꜣsw yhw,” *the land of the Shasu of Yahweh* [^cite_7](^cite_7). This is the earliest known reference to the name *Yahweh*. It suggests that **Yahweh was originally worshipped by semi-nomadic peoples in the southern Transjordan or Sinai** – likely as a patron deity of those tribes. In other words, long before Yahweh was known in the hill country of Canaan, he was a **desert god** associated with the wilderness and remote regions. Mark S. Smith and others argue that Yahweh began as a **Midianite or Edomite warrior-storm god**, akin to Baal in function but rooted in the south. He may have been venerated by clans like the Kenites or Shasu whom the Israelites encountered during their early migrations. Indeed, in the Exodus tradition Moses flees to Midian and there joins a Midianite family whose patriarch *Jethro* is a priest of the “God of Sinai” – a narrative hint that the knowledge of Yahweh was conveyed to Israel through Midianite channels (Exodus 18:1-12). This Southern origin theory is also supported by the theophoric names and poetry of early Israel: Yahweh is portrayed marching from Edom with mountain-quaking power (Habakkuk 3:3, Psalm 68:7-8). Thus, rather than being an age-old Canaanite god of the agricultural cycle, Yahweh burst onto the scene of Israelite religion as a **divine warrior from the desert**, a god of storms and battles who **“came from Teman”** (Hab. 3:3) to fight on Israel’s behalf.

Crucially, when Yahweh entered the Israelite highland culture (perhaps in the early Iron Age, ca. 12th–11th centuries BCE), he did not do so as an immediate supreme deity. **He had to compete and coexist with the established gods** of the land. Initially, Yahweh may have been seen as a manifestation or newcomer under the authority of El, the venerable creator. Frank Moore Cross, in *Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic*, observed that by the time of the Judges and early monarchy, **Yahweh was increasingly identified with El**, effectively subsuming El’s role as chief god of Israel. In early Israelite poetry, titles and attributes of El are often applied to Yahweh. For instance, Genesis 49:24 calls Yahweh “the Mighty One of Jacob” (*abir Ya‘aqov*), and similar epithet transfers occur frequently. Cross even speculated that the very name “Yahweh” might derive from a cultic title of El (*ʾēl ḏū yahwī ṣaba’ôt*, meaning “El who creates the hosts”), though direct evidence for this is lacking. Whether or not that etymology holds, it is clear that **Israel’s understanding of Yahweh grew by absorbing aspects of El**. As Mark S. Smith describes it, a process of “convergence” took place: over a few centuries, traits of other deities converged on Yahweh. El’s creator beneficence, Baal’s storm-bringing power, even Asherah’s nurturing aspects – all were gradually incorporated into Yahweh’s persona. By the time the Israelite kingdom was established, many Israelites spoke of Yahweh with epithets that once belonged to El (such as *El Shaddai* or *El Elyon*). **Yahweh had effectively become Israel’s national god**, but in a way that merged identities: Yahweh was now understood as the same god who was formerly called El, the “God of the fathers”. This syncretism is vividly illustrated by the *Bull Iconography*. The bull was a symbol of El’s strength and Baal’s fertility in Canaanite religion, and significantly, the **earliest Israelite cultic shrine discovered (the 12th-century BCE “Bull Site” in Samaria)** contained a bronze bull figurine likely representing the deity of that sanctuary. Scholars interpret this as evidence that the worshippers at that site envisioned their god in the form of a bull – suggesting they saw Yahweh (if it was Yahweh they worshipped) as embodying El’s potent virility or Baal’s storm vigor. In any case, by the 10th or 9th century BCE, **Yahweh had risen to the top of Israel’s pantheon**, effectively displacing El in that position. But beneath him remained a host of lesser gods – Baal, Asherah, Astarte, Chemosh, Dagon, etc. – reverenced by various Israelite communities. The **path toward monotheism** would be anything but smooth, as it required eradicating or redefining these other divine figures that had long been part of Israel’s religious life.

## From Henotheism to Exclusive Yahweh Worship

During the monarchic period (c. 1000–586 BCE), pressures both internal and external began pushing Israelite religion toward **exclusive Yahweh worship**. This was a slow transformation from **henotheism or monolatry** (worship of one god without denying others exist) to true monotheism (belief that only one god exists). Early on, many Israelites might have **worshipped Yahweh as their patron without denying that other nations had their own gods**. In fact, an old poem preserved in Deuteronomy 32:8–9 (in one textual tradition) implies that Yahweh was originally seen as one of the “sons of El” assigned to Israel, while other peoples had their own patron deities [^cite_8](^cite_8). This reflects a worldview in which Yahweh was *supreme for Israel* but not alone in the universe. Such a theology is often called *monolatry*. For centuries, the official religion of Israel and Judah can be described as **Yahwistic monolatry**: in principle the nation should worship only Yahweh, but it was acknowledged (even by the First Commandment, “no other gods *before Me*”) that other gods existed for other peoples. Enforcement of this ideal within Israel itself waxed and waned. The historical books of the Bible recount constant lapses and “idolatry” – which, from the modern perspective, were simply Israelites continuing to honor Baal, Asherah, the Queen of Heaven, and other divinities alongside Yahweh, as had been customary for generations.

Several factors gradually **turned the tide against polytheistic worship**. One was the rise of prophecy as a force for religious purity. Prophets like *Elijah*, *Hosea*, and *Jeremiah* passionately championed sole allegiance to Yahweh and excoriated the Israelites for “whoring” after other gods. The showdown between Elijah and the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18) is a vivid example: Elijah poses the challenge, “If Yahweh is God, follow him; if Baal, then follow him,” reflecting a growing insistence on an either-or choice. According to the biblical account, Elijah’s victory led to the execution of Baal’s prophets and a temporary resurgence of exclusive Yahweh worship. Historically, we might doubt the full eradication of Baalism at that moment, but **by the 9th century BCE the ideological conflict between Yahweh and Baal had sharpened**. King Ahab’s sponsorship of Baal’s cult in Samaria (under the influence of Queen Jezebel of Tyre) provoked a backlash that, in the biblical memory, made **Yahweh versus Baal** a zero-sum conflict. From that point on, Yahweh’s worshippers treated Baal as a rival not to be tolerated. **Worship of Baal and Yahweh could no longer peacefully coexist** as it seemingly had in earlier times. The prophets continually reminded Israel that calamity would follow infidelity to Yahweh – a warning that gained credibility as the kingdom of Israel faced mounting political disasters.

Another factor was **political centralization under kings who supported Yahweh-alone theology**. The clearest example is King *Josiah* of Judah (late 7th century BCE). Building on earlier reforms (perhaps initiated by King Hezekiah a century prior), Josiah undertook a radical purge of non-Yahwistic religion: he destroyed rural shrines (the *high places*), defiled the altars of other gods, removed the statue of Asherah from the Temple in Jerusalem, and slaughtered illegitimate priests (see 2 Kings 22–23). Josiah’s reform (c. 622 BCE), which coincided with the “discovery” of a law book often identified with Deuteronomy, **aimed to establish Yahweh as the *only* god of Judah** and Jerusalem’s Temple as the only sanctioned place of worship. This reform was both religious and political: by centralizing worship in the capital, Josiah tightened his control over the kingdom and its ideology. Archaeology bears witness to the aftermath; for example, at Tel Arad in the Beersheba Valley, a small fortress-temple dedicated to Yahweh (and probably Asherah) was **deliberately dismantled in the late 7th century**, likely as part of Josiah’s purge. Two incense altars and standing stones were buried there, one stone possibly representing Yahweh and the other Asherah. Throughout the land, similar local cultic sites were shuttered. Such measures dramatically narrowed the scope of acceptable worship – a **theological narrowing** hand in hand with political unification. Yet, it is important to note that **Josiah’s monotheistic reform was short-lived** in impact. His death in battle (609 BCE) and the subsequent upheavals meant that old practices crept back, at least among the populace. As Ziony Zevit has observed, neither Israel nor Judah ever achieved total cultic uniformity; even during the monarchy, pockets of folk religion endured and the populace’s faith “was not monolithic in either monotheism or polytheism”. Still, by the end of the 7th century, a dedicated core of Yahweh-only loyalists had formed – a party of theologians, prophets, and reformers who **defined national devotion in fiercely exclusive terms** [^cite_9](^cite_9). These believers (the Deuteronomistic circle, we might call them) set the stage for what would become full-blown monotheism, though the decisive push was yet to come.

## Crisis and Exile: The Crucible of Monotheism

It was the shattering series of events in the 6th century BCE – the **collapse of the Israelite kingdoms under Assyrian and Babylonian empires** – that truly gave birth to Jewish monotheism as we know it. The northern kingdom of Israel had already been destroyed by Assyria in 722 BCE, an event that some prophets interpreted as Yahweh’s judgment on a nation that worshipped “Baals” (Hosea 2:8, 13). But an even greater theological crisis followed a century later. In 586 BCE, the Babylonians conquered Judah, burned Jerusalem, razed Solomon’s Temple, and deported a large portion of the Judahite population to exile in Babylon. This national catastrophe was unprecedented. It forced the Judahite elites and priests to ask: **Had Yahweh been defeated by Babylon’s god Marduk?** Were the old promises to David and Zion false, or was Yahweh punishing his own people? The very covenant seemed broken. In response to this existential despair, a remarkable transformation took place among the exiled Judeans. Rather than abandon Yahweh for the apparent victor (Marduk), the Judean theologians went in the opposite direction – they **doubled down on Yahweh’s supremacy, to the point of denying the reality of any other god**. In the words of one scholar, the “collective and trans-generational trauma of the Babylonian Exile” catalyzed a theological revolution, serving as the *birth trauma of monotheism* [^cite_10](^cite_10). During the exile, prophets and priests reinterpreted Israel’s entire history, concluding that **Yahweh alone had been in charge all along** – not just of Israel, but of Assyria and Babylon too. Second Isaiah (Isaiah 40–55), writing in Babylon, declares boldly that Yahweh is *the only God*: “*I am Yahweh, and there is none else*” (Isa. 45:5). He even makes Yahweh say, “*I form light and create darkness, I make peace and create evil*” (Isa. 45:7), a stunning assertion that all forces, good or bad, come from one deity. This was a direct answer to the problem of the exile: if disaster struck, it must have been Yahweh’s doing, since no other gods exist to oppose him. Thus the **destruction of Judah was interpreted as Yahweh’s own work** – a drastic, even tragic, reimagining of Israel’s god as the lord of all history, using the pagan armies as unwitting instruments of his will.

By the end of the Babylonian captivity (538 BCE), this **monotheistic idea** had crystallized among the Judeans. As one historical summary puts it, during the exile “the followers of Yahweh went a step further and denied that any deities aside from Yahweh existed at all – marking the transition from monolatry to monotheism”. In effect, **Yahweh had no more competition**: the other gods were either declared fictional or demoted to insignificant demons. When the Persians (who were monotheists of a sort themselves, worshipping Ahura Mazda) allowed the Judeans to return and rebuild the Temple, the Judah that emerged in the 5th century BCE was ideologically committed to *Yahweh-alone*. This does not mean that folk beliefs in angels, spirits, or even divine consorts vanished overnight, but the mainstream religious leadership now preached an uncompromising monotheism. The many gods of old were reinterpreted as mere names or attributes of the one Yahweh, or as idols with “no breath in them.” In the fervent rhetoric of this period (found in Second Isaiah, Jeremiah, Deuteronomy, etc.), we can sense both **triumph and loss** – triumph that Yahweh is vindicated as the true god of all nations, but loss in the abandonment of a rich divine council that had once populated Israel’s spiritual imagination. Monotheism, in this light, **arose from the ashes of defeat**. It was a theological consolation prize for a people who had lost everything else. Rather than concede that Marduk or Baal had overpowered Yahweh, the faithful reinterpreted Yahweh as having *used Babylon* to chastise his people. This interpretation kept Yahweh’s omnipotence intact at the cost of making him the author of their trauma. Herein lies the “tragic development” of our title: Israel’s devotion to Yahweh became more absolute **because of national tragedy** – because only an all-powerful god could still be worth worshipping after allowing His own house to burn.

## A Narrowing Path – Monotheism as Historical Response

The rise of Jewish monotheism was not a calm, philosophical evolution toward a higher truth; it was a **hard-fought, painful contraction of theological possibilities** under the pressure of historical catastrophe. Scholars like Mark S. Smith have emphasized that Israel’s shift to one-god-only faith was contingent and context-dependent – a response to the collapse of older certainties, not an inevitable progression of religious thought. What began as **monolatry born from covenant loyalty** (“Yahweh is our god, we should have no others before him”) turned into a far more extreme claim in the exile: **Yahweh is the *only* god, and he is behind both our rise and our fall**. This **narrowing of theological vision** – from many gods, to one god for us, to one God for all – came at a spiritual cost. The rich pantheon of the Iron Age, with its balancing of divine male and female, storm and fertility, war and wisdom, was largely wiped away. The people of Israel/Judah, scarred by war and displacement, found meaning in an uncompromising creed that explained their suffering as part of a divine plan. Monotheism was, in a sense, **the last god left standing** after the others had failed to protect. 

From an academic perspective, we can trace how this consolidation was driven by **violence and trauma** at every stage. The convergence of Yahweh with El and Baal was likely accelerated by the **violence of state formation** – as the Israelite kingdoms established themselves, they elevated their national patron (Yahweh) through royal propaganda and, when possible, suppressed rival cults. The elimination of Baal worship, for example, was often a bloody affair (Jehu’s massacre of Baal’s priests in 2 Kings 10, or the aforementioned Carmel contest). The monotheistic reforms involved **iconoclasm and persecution** of those attached to traditional folk religion (Josiah’s reform is recounted as violently as it is zealously). Finally, the **violence of foreign conquest and exile** forced a spiritual crisis that snuffed out any remaining ambiguity: only an omnipotent Yahweh could ultimately make sense of the disaster. It is therefore accurate to say that **monotheism did not emerge out of serene theological reasoning**, but out of **historical brokenness**. The academic John Day notes that even after these developments, vestiges of polytheism lingered in the culture (for instance, personal names in the 6th century still sometimes contained Baal or El, showing a broader cultural memory). But the official theological trajectory had turned decisively toward **“Yahweh alone”**. Frank Moore Cross observed that what made Israelite religion unique was not the idea of one god per se (many Ancient Near Eastern religions had a supreme deity), but the **denial of all others** – and this idea took shape powerfully in the exilic and post-exilic community as a kind of “silent revolution.” [^cite_11](^cite_11) In the Second Temple period that followed, Jewish religion was rebuilt around the sole worship of Yahweh, now understood as the universal Creator, the source of both Israel’s hope and Israel’s suffering. 

Looking at this development with a tragic lens means recognizing the **loss and suffering inherent in the birth of monotheism**. It was “tragic” not in the sense of being unfortunate (from a believer’s viewpoint monotheism is a profound truth), but in the classical sense of arising through **tragic circumstances** – through downfall, struggle, and profound cost. Theological diversity was sacrificed for the sake of identity and survival. The **cult of Yahweh** had to slay its own family, as it were, to emerge pure. What had begun centuries earlier as a simple reverence of one god among many ended in an absolute claim that would forever distinguish Judaism (and its offshoots Christianity and Islam) from the religions of the ancient world. As one era’s gods faded into memory, **Yahweh stood alone**, transfigured by Israel’s pain into the One God of all. This opening chapter, then, traces how that remarkable transformation occurred – **not by predestined philosophical enlightenment, but through a crucible of history**: war, collapse, exile, and the relentless **prophetic drive to find meaning in disaster**. In the developments ahead, we shall see how each stage of Yahweh’s evolution – from warrior of Sinai to King of Heaven – carried with it both gain and loss, and why understanding this **tragic development of Jewish monotheism** is crucial for comprehending the spiritual trajectory of the Western world [^cite_12](^cite_12).
