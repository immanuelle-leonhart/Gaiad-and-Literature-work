# Soja

A Pantheon, also known as a Soja 総社 or a Shinden 神殿, and maybe called the Soshinden 総神殿 is the area of an Ichinomiya that venerates all the gods of the subordinate shrines.

It is based on two things in shinto: 

1. [Soja](Soja)(:en:Soja): A kind of shrine that enshrines all the gods of its local area
1. [Shinden](Shinden)(shinto:Hasshinden): A shrine that is one of the [Palace Sanctuaries](Three)(:en:Three_Palace_Sanctuaries). While originally only eight gods were enshrined there. It came to be that all the gods were enshrined there during the meiji period
## The link of them might be my original thing. Soshinden has these attestations[^cite_1](^cite_1)[^cite_2](^cite_2)[^cite_3](^cite_3)


However we use the translation of "Pantheon" in english because the word coming from Greek has an established meaning roughly similar

The Pantheon will have small Shintai preserving the gods of all the areas.
