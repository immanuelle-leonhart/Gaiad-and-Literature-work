# Religion Book - ACTUAL Complete Structure

## **Core Thesis**

## **Key Structural Elements**

### **Anachronistic Narrative Device**
- **Setup**: Japan chapters end with Perry arriving (1853)
- **Jump Back**: "Let's see how Perry became Commodore Perry"
- **Historical Development**: Protestant Reformation → American revivals → colonialism
- **Return**: Continue Japan narrative through 1945

### **Major Themes**
1. **Part I-II**: Historical foundations (brief treatment)
2. **Part III**: The real story - how "religion" as category developed
3. **Part IV**: Post-1945 commercialization and final obsolescence

### **Contemporary Focus**
- **1945** as major turning point for "interesting modern religion"
- Post-war commercialization and political weaponization
- Internet age transformation and cultural appropriation
- Final obsolescence of "religion" as useful category

### **Writing Approach**
- **Dramatic structure**: Cliffhanger with Perry, anachronistic jump
- **Critical stance**: "Religion" as problematic categorization throughout
- **Contemporary relevance**: Focus on current cultural appropriation, internet religion
- **Final argument**: Complete abandonment of "religion" concept

This structure shows the book is actually focused on the modern development and ultimate obsolescence of "religion" as a concept, with the historical monotheism material serving as foundation rather than the main argument.
