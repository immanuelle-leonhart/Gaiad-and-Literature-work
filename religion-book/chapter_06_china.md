# China Chapter

Perfect. I’ll begin drafting the China chapter with an optimistic tone, tracing how Chinese religious traditions—beginning from the Shang and Zhou periods—resisted monotheistic consolidation and theological overcoding. The chapter will highlight how China's polytheistic and ritual-pluralist heritage was preserved and reinforced through Confucian philosophy, Daoist multiplicity, syncretic Buddhism, and a decentralized bureaucratic state.

I’ll integrate Deleuze and Guattari's framework (especially the idea of 'overcoding') to contrast China's resistance with the fate of monotheistic traditions elsewhere. I’ll let you know when the first draft is ready.

1. Religious Pluralism and the Avoidance of Monotheistic Overcoding in China

## Introduction: Many Gods, One Harmony

Ancient China offers a striking counterpoint to the well-known trajectory of Western monotheism. Whereas the Hebrew tradition moved toward an exclusive covenant with a single God – a development often seen as a tragic narrowing of ancient religious diversity – China’s religious landscape evolved in a decidedly pluralistic direction. From its earliest dynasties, Chinese civilization anchored political order in a tapestry of ancestral spirits, nature deities, and cosmic forces, rather than in one jealous deity. This opening chapter explores how China *avoided* the kind of “monotheistic overcoding” that elsewhere collapsed a rich multiplicity of gods into **One**. Instead, Chinese religion maintained an optimistic model of plurality: a flexible balance managed by rituals and political structures that sustained cosmic diversity. 

To tell this story, we begin in the Shang and Zhou dynasties, where ancestor worship, shamanism, oracle bones and ritual kingship laid the foundation of a pluralistic sacred order. We then see how Confucian philosophy – with its emphasis on **li** (ritual propriety), **ren** (benevolence), and social harmony – provided a moral cosmos that required no single supreme god. The rise of Daoist traditions further enriched this openness through their diverse pantheons and anti-dogmatic cosmology. Buddhism’s arrival, instead of enforcing exclusive truth, was **transformed** through syncretism with Confucian and Daoist practices. Throughout imperial history, the state (via institutions like the Ministry of Rites) acted as a ritual coordinator rather than a theocratic enforcer, ensuring no theology gained absolute sway. Finally, using Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of “overcoding,” we reflect on how the Chinese imperial state resisted collapsing the many into One – unlike, for example, Rome with Christianity or Persia with Zoroastrianism. In sum, Chinese civilization never underwent a shift to exclusive monotheism, thanks to a confluence of institutional, philosophical, and cultural factors that upheld pluralism and **prevented** the reduction of cosmic multiplicity to a single dogma.

## Ancient Foundations: Ancestors, Shamans, and Oracle Bones

China’s pluralistic ethos has deep roots in its **Bronze Age** civilization. During the **Shang dynasty** (c. 1600–1046 BCE), religion was inherently **polytheistic** and ancestral. The Shang king functioned as a high priest or **shaman**, mediating between the living and a host of spirits [^cite_1](^cite_1). Oracle bone inscriptions from this period reveal a vibrant spirit world: the king would inscribe questions on ox bones or turtle shells and then interpret the cracks from fire to discern the will of ancestors and nature powers. Notably, these inscriptions show the Shang ruler worshipping many entities – from departed royal forebears to river and mountain deities – rather than one omnipotent god. For example, a Shang oracle text records the king “worshipping their ancestors and nature gods, praying for a good harvest by sacrificing sheep and cattle” [^cite_2](^cite_2). Ancestor veneration was paramount: the departed elders of the royal lineage were believed to exert real influence on outcomes (illness, harvest, warfare) and thus had to be propitiated with ritual and sacrifice [^cite_3](^cite_3). This belief in the **power of dead ancestors** to aid or afflict the living, and the consequent need to appease *all* these spirits, meant Shang religion could never be summed up by a single deity’s will [^cite_4](^cite_4). Instead, spiritual authority was distributed among a hierarchy of beings. At the apex of this hierarchy the Shang recognized **Shangdi** (上帝, “High Lord”), but Shangdi was less a **creator-god** than a supreme ancestor or high spirit who presided over many others [^cite_5](^cite_5). Crucially, Shangdi did not demand exclusive worship: he coexisted with a multitude of nature gods and ancestral spirits under him [^cite_6](^cite_6). In short, the Shang religious system was a network of **plural powers**, with the king orchestrating rituals to maintain harmony among heaven, earth, and the ancestral clan.

The succeeding **Zhou dynasty** (c. 1046–256 BCE) inherited this pluralistic framework even as it introduced new concepts. The early Zhou rulers, to legitimize overthrowing the Shang, invoked **Tian** (天, “Heaven”) as a kind of supreme cosmic principle. The famous **Mandate of Heaven** idea held that Heaven granted rulers the right to govern based on their virtue, and could withdraw that mandate if they became despotic. While this might seem like a move toward a singular, moral Heaven, Zhou religion still remained far from monotheistic. “Heaven” in Zhou usage was not a personal god enforcing sole worship; it was a diffuse moral order, often interchangeable with the will of **Shangdi** and allied ancestral spirits [^cite_7](^cite_7). In fact, archaeological and textual evidence suggests the Zhou **integrated** the Shang high god into their concept of Heaven [^cite_8](^cite_8). Heaven thus became an **abstract high deity** that supported just kings, but Zhou kings continued to perform ceremonies to a host of other entities – ancestors of various ranks, the spirits of soil and grain, and gods of wind, rain, and mountains. The Zhou court maintained elaborate sacrificial rituals to *hundreds* of spirits, great and small. Rather than abolishing the Shang pantheon, the Zhou *renamed* and moralized it. This set the pattern for Chinese cosmology: even when one principle (like Heaven) was elevated, it did not annihilate the rest. The legitimacy of kings still depended on honoring **many** invisible forces. As one historian observes, even supposedly “secular” innovations like the standardized Zhou *calendar* had a religious-political purpose: each new dynasty issued its own calendar to mark a new cosmic era, complete with its distinctive pantheon of ancestral and natural spirits [^cite_9](^cite_9). The Zhou and later Chinese states thus continually recognized **multiplicity** – Heaven, yes, but also Earth, ancestors, and a panoply of gods – in their ideology.

## Confucianism: Ritual Order without a Supreme God

By the late Zhou era (the *Spring and Autumn* and *Warring States* periods), Chinese thinkers were reflecting deeply on how to preserve social and cosmic order amid political chaos. It is in this context that **Confucius** (Kongzi, 551–479 BCE) developed a philosophy that would profoundly shape China’s religious pluralism. Confucius did *not* found a new religion with a novel god; rather, he reinterpreted the inherited ritual system (**li** 礼) as the foundation of a stable civilization [^cite_10](^cite_10) [^cite_11](^cite_11). Confucius was concerned with the same problem a monotheistic prophet might tackle – the basis of a unified moral order – but he arrived at a **radically different solution**. Instead of positing a single transcendent deity who imposes order, Confucius located order in the **performance of proper relationships**: between ruler and minister, parent and child, husband and wife, elder and younger, friend and friend. Each of these human relationships was to be guided by ritual propriety and empathy (ren). **Ritual**, in the Confucian view, was not about appeasing one god’s jealousy, but about cultivating **social harmony** and virtue through time-honored forms [^cite_12](^cite_12) [^cite_13](^cite_13). As one analysis puts it, Confucius “interpreted [Zhou](Zhou) rituals not as sacrifices asking for the blessings of the gods, but as ceremonies performed by human agents embodying civilized patterns of behavior” [^cite_14](^cite_14). In other words, the **efficacy** of ritual lay in its ability to shape ethical humans and a harmonious community – *not* in cajoling a deity. Thus, Confucianism provided a **metaphysical and ethical framework** for order that required no singular divine lawgiver.

It is important to note that Confucius did not deny the spiritual world; he simply downplayed its centrality. He inherited the Zhou belief in Heaven (Tian) as a sort of moral force. In Confucius’s own life, he sometimes spoke of **Heaven’s will** guiding him. But he was notably agnostic about the specifics of gods and spirits. A famous Analects passage has Confucius advising to “respect the ghosts and spirits but keep them at a distance” – an injunction to focus on human duties rather than divine mysteries. Indeed, Confucianism is often described as **humanistic** or a “civil religion” built into social institutions [^cite_15](^cite_15). As the Asia Society scholars note, it functioned as a “diffused religion” whose “priests” were family patriarchs, teachers, and officials, not a separate clerical class [^cite_16](^cite_16). The Emperor conducting state sacrifices to Heaven or a son performing ancestral rites at home were *Confucian* acts in that they upheld social morality and continuity. But neither act implied an **exclusive** theological claim (“only my god is real”). In fact, because Confucianism lacked a personal creator-god or a binding dogma about the afterlife, it coexisted **easily with pluralism**. By emphasizing values like **filial piety** (xiao), **benevolence** (ren), and **ritual decorum** (li), Confucianism created a unifying cultural ethos *without* canonizing a sole deity. It upheld the importance of venerating ancestors and Heaven, but as part of a broader ethical life [^cite_17](^cite_17) [^cite_18](^cite_18). 

Under the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), Confucianism became state orthodoxy – yet the Han state still conducted sacrifices to a range of powers (Heaven, Earth, mountains, rivers, ancestors, etc.). Han Confucian scholars rationalized and systematized the old rites, effectively **secularizing** them. The “Mandate of Heaven” was treated as a principle of political legitimacy rather than literal theophany [^cite_19](^cite_19). Court diviners still read portents (eclipses, earthquakes) as messages from Heaven, but these practices were integrated into bureaucracy [^cite_20](^cite_20). The net effect was that Confucian statecraft *absorbed* Chinese religion rather than replacing it. The state cult was inclusive: Emperors in the imperial era would, for instance, perform the **jiao** sacrifice to Heaven at the winter solstice, pay seasonal respects to soil and grain gods, offer incense in Confucius’s temple, and honor local deities when touring provinces. This fulfills what one scholar calls the “civil religion” role of Confucianism – providing a common **moral framework** – while allowing a spectrum of devotional practices to flourish beneath it [^cite_21](^cite_21). Confucianism’s genius was precisely in offering **ethical overcoding** (imposing a unified moral order) *without* theological exclusivity. There was simply no Confucian notion that “all gods but one are false.” Instead, all gods that encouraged virtue, order, or community loyalty could be acknowledged as culturally useful. This openness paved the way for the next waves of thought, Daoism and Buddhism, to be integrated rather than obliterated.

## Daoist Metaphysics: Embracing the Mysterious Many

Parallel to the Confucian rationalization of ritual, **Daoist** (Taoist) thought emerged as another major stream reinforcing Chinese pluralism. If Confucianism represented the official ethos of order, **Daoism** embodied a more mystical and nature-oriented outlook – one that was inherently **anti-dogmatic** and comfortable with multiplicity. Early philosophical Daoism (5th–3rd centuries BCE, associated with texts like the *Laozi* (Tao Te Ching) and *Zhuangzi*) explicitly **refuted** the idea that there must be one correct *dao* (Way) for everyone [^cite_22](^cite_22) [^cite_23](^cite_23). The Dao, as described by Laozi, is an ineffable process underlying the cosmos – “the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao.” This foundational Daoist idea resists any fixed, unitary coding of truth. Daoist sages argued that human interpretations of the Dao are many and relative; no single doctrine can grasp the **whole**. The **Zhuangzi**, in particular, delights in demonstrating the limits of any one perspective. It portrays different beings (humans, animals, even fantastical creatures) each seeing the world in their own way – and suggests all these viewpoints have validity within the larger Dao. As the *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy* notes, Zhuangzi’s **pluralism** undermined the common assumption (held by Confucians and their rivals the Mohists) that “proper order was achieved only when a society followed a single dao” [^cite_24](^cite_24). Instead, Daoism taught that the **natural order** accommodates diversity: “The social world survives as well (or better) when people follow different ways of life” [^cite_25](^cite_25). This perspectival thinking prevented the rise of any dogmatic “One Truth” in Chinese philosophy – a sharp contrast to the Near Eastern trajectory where prophets and priests increasingly insisted on **one true God, one true Law**.

Over time, Daoism also developed religious institutions (often termed *Religious Daoism* to distinguish from the early philosophy). By the late Han dynasty (2nd century CE), organized Daoist movements like the **Way of the Celestial Masters** had formed, complete with rites, scriptures, and pantheons of deities. Far from becoming monolithic, Daoism cultivated an **ever-expanding pantheon**. Daoist cosmology envisioned multiple heavens populated by innumerable immortals, gods, and spirits. It incorporated local tutelary deities, stellar divinities, and personifications of natural forces. Even **Laozi** himself was apotheosized as Lord Lao, and later tradition spoke of the “Three Pure Ones” – a trinity of highest Daoist gods – alongside a vast bureaucracy of lesser gods. Notably, this proliferation of deities did not provoke sectarian conflict with older ancestral or Confucian rites; instead, it layered onto them. A village in medieval China might simultaneously maintain a Confucian-style ancestral hall, a Daoist temple to the local mountain god, and a shrine for Buddhist Bodhisattvas – all without a sense of contradiction. This was possible because Daoist theology was **cosmologically inclusive**. It did not demand a single Creator or a single path to salvation. The **Dao** itself was seen as too all-encompassing to be limited to one image. As one comparative study summarizes, “philosophical Daoism tends toward pluralism, perspectivalism, skepticism, political equality and freedom,” in contrast to traditions that impose one hegemonic truth [^cite_26](^cite_26). The *Zhuangzi* even jokes that from the perspective of the Dao, concepts like good/bad or god/devil are just *relative* – so how could one ever insist on a sole god for all? 

Daoist metaphysics also fostered an attitude of **“live and let live”** toward other beliefs. A Daoist might see other religious practices as just different people following their own *dao*, all of which ultimately partake in the Great Dao. This spirit is captured in later folklore like the story of the **Three Laughs at Tiger Brook**, where a Confucian, a Buddhist, and a Daoist sage meet and laugh together upon realizing the unity of their different paths. Such tales reflect the deeply ingrained idea that the **Three Teachings** (Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism) are simply three expressions of one cosmic truth – a notion commonly phrased as “**Three Teachings harmonious as one**” [^cite_27](^cite_27). Importantly, this harmony was not achieved by **erasing** differences (as monotheistic syncretism often does by subsuming other gods into one) but by **acknowledging** and balancing differences. The Daoist contribution here was its **cosmological openness**: since Dao transcends naming, no single doctrine can claim monopoly, leaving ample room for many gods and ways within the larger tapestry.

## Buddhism’s Peaceful Syncretism in China

The pluralistic fabric of Chinese religion was further enriched (and tested) when **Buddhism** entered China in the first century CE. Buddhism began in India as a non-theistic philosophy – centered on the Four Noble Truths and liberation from suffering – and it developed its own cosmologies and devotional practices. One might expect a foreign religion with distinct doctrines of karma, rebirth, and nirvana to clash with indigenous beliefs. Indeed, at times there were points of tension (for example, Buddhism’s renunciation of the family life seemed to conflict with Confucian filial piety). Yet, remarkably, Buddhism was **absorbed and transformed** in China through a gradual process of **syncretism**. Rather than displacing the older traditions, it blended with them, yielding uniquely Chinese forms of Buddhism that coexisted alongside Confucian and Daoist practices.

Several factors allowed Buddhism to integrate without enforcing exclusive claims. First, Buddhism as carried along the Silk Road was predominantly **Mahayana** Buddhism, which is expansive and inclusive in spirit. Mahayana teaching holds that there are countless Buddhas and Bodhisattvas working for the salvation of all beings – a view quite compatible with China’s idea of numerous enlightened or immortal figures. Chinese Buddhists did not insist that the Buddha was the *only* deity; in fact, they often didn’t regard Buddhas as gods at all, but as enlightened teachers or cosmic principles. This meant Buddhism could **add** to the pantheon (e.g. images of Amitabha Buddha or Guanyin were added to temples) rather than demanding the destruction of existing gods. Indeed, many Chinese identified **Guanyin** (Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion) with attributes of older female deities and even local mother-goddess figures, making her a beloved figure in popular worship without any doctrinal war on other faiths.

Second, Buddhism made deliberate efforts to **accommodate** Chinese values. The doctrine of **filial piety** was woven into Buddhist stories (e.g. the tale of Maitreya Buddha’s past life as a filial son), and monasteries often participated in community rituals that honored ancestors. Far from telling Chinese to abandon ancestor worship in favor of a new god, Buddhist monks often performed ceremonies to bless ancestors in the afterlife, thus complementing Confucian duties. Over centuries, the ideal emerged that a truly wise person would honor *all three* teachings: govern society with Confucian ethics, attain personal insight through Daoist-like contemplation, and seek spiritual salvation via Buddhist practices. By the **Tang dynasty** (618–907 CE), this attitude was common. An oft-cited maxim was “San Jiao Yi Jia” – *the Three Teachings are one family*. Emperors themselves would patronize all three: for instance, Tang Taizong honored Confucius, claimed Laozi as an ancestor (legend held Laozi’s surname Li was the imperial clan’s forebear), and sponsored Buddhist temples. One visual symbol of this unity was the construction of sites like the **Hanging Temple** (Xuankong Si) in Shanxi, which famously enshrined statues of the Buddha, Laozi, and Confucius together in one complex [^cite_28](^cite_28). In its Hall of Three Religions, the images of Śakyamuni (the Buddha), Lao-tzu, and Confucius sit side by side on the altar – an embodiment of the idea that these three wisdoms jointly uphold China’s cosmic and social order [^cite_29](^cite_29).

 [^cite_30](^cite_30) *The Hanging Temple in Datong, China, exemplifies imperial-era religious pluralism. Built into a cliff, this temple (started in the 6th century CE) enshrines Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian figures together. In its main hall, statues of the Buddha (center), Laozi (left), and Confucius (right) are worshipped side by side, reflecting the Ming-Qing dynasty notion of “Three Teachings Harmonious as One” [^cite_31](^cite_31). Such sites underscore how Chinese civilization integrated multiple faiths under one cultural roof, rather than enforcing a single orthodox creed.*

To be sure, Buddhism at times enjoyed imperial favor at the expense of Daoism or vice versa, and there were occasional persecutions (e.g. Emperor Wuzong’s brief suppression of Buddhism in 845 CE). But even these were **political and economic** measures (aimed at curbing monastic wealth or foreign influence) rather than attempts to establish a **religious monopoly**. No Chinese ruler ever tried to declare Buddha as the *only* god and banish all others, the way Roman emperors eventually outlawed pagan worship after adopting Christianity [^cite_32](^cite_32). Instead, at most we see periods of *relative* preference: e.g. the **Song dynasty** (960–1279) re-emphasized Confucianism (in the form of Neo-Confucian philosophy) as the guiding ideology, leading to Buddhism and Daoism being somewhat less fashionable at court [^cite_33](^cite_33). But they were still **tolerated** and continued to flourish among the populace. In fact, Neo-Confucianism itself absorbed Buddhist and Daoist ideas (such as **Li**理 principle and **Qi**氣 vital energy) into a new synthesis – again demonstrating the Chinese tendency to **merge and balance** rather than to eradicate. Scholars have pointed out that each of the three traditions had its role: “Confucianism was the ideology of the law, institutions and ruling class; Taoism was the worldview of the radical intellectuals and…compatible with the spiritual beliefs of the peasants and artisans. The two…jointly created the Chinese ‘image of the world’” [^cite_34](^cite_34), to which we must add Buddhism as another layer that provided solace about suffering and hope for enlightenment. This functional differentiation meant there was **room for all** – a stark contrast to societies where church and state tried to make one faith all-encompassing.

## The Imperial State as Guardian of Pluralism

A key reason China avoided monotheistic overcoding is that the **imperial state** took on the role of arbiter among religious forces, rather than champion of one. From the Han dynasty onward, Chinese emperors styled themselves as the **Son of Heaven** (Tianzi), responsible for maintaining harmony between Heaven, Earth, and humankind. In practice, this meant performing elaborate **state rituals** to honor various cosmic entities. The emperor annually sacrificed to **Heaven and Earth** at the Temple of Heaven and Temple of Earth, offered seasonal rites to the sun and moon, ceremonially ploughed a sacred furrow to thank the agriculture deities, and led rites for ancestors and patron sages. Crucially, the imperial court oversaw a **bureaucracy of rites** that managed all these ceremonies – a secular administration of the sacred, if you will. By institutionalizing worship of **many** objects (Heaven, Earth, ancestors, etc.) as state functions, the Chinese Empire *institutionalized pluralism*. No single priesthood could gain exclusive power because ritual power was distributed across different cults and ministries.

The establishment of the **Ministry of Rites** (Lǐbu 礼部) under the Tang dynasty exemplifies this principle. This Ministry was one of the Six Ministries of government, and it was charged with managing *all* court rituals and sacrifices, as well as the registration of Buddhist and Daoist clergy [^cite_35](^cite_35). In effect, the Ministry of Rites acted as a regulator ensuring that religious practice supported social order but never veered into independent theocratic authority. For instance, it supervised the exams for **state-sponsored monks** and Daoist priests, curbing any single sect from claiming autonomy. It also handled foreign tributes and the reception of **foreign religions** (e.g. it would oversee how Nestorian Christians or Muslims were allowed to settle and build places of worship in certain periods). The very existence of such a ministry highlights that the **state, not a church**, held the mandate to define acceptable religious expressions. Unlike in medieval Europe – where the Church could excommunicate a king or dictate orthodoxy – in China the state absorbed religious roles and thus kept any one doctrine from monopolizing the public sphere.

Moreover, Chinese law, influenced by Confucian values, generally did not prosecute people for **belief** as long as outward behavior (loyalty, filial piety, paying taxes, etc.) conformed. Heresy per se was not a common charge; instead, the government acted against religious groups primarily when they became **rebellious** or socially disruptive (for example, millenarian sects like the Yellow Turbans in the 2nd century or White Lotus in later times). Thus, unorthodox sects were suppressed for political security, not for theological deviation. The everyday religious life of the Chinese people – which often included **mixing practices** from Buddhism, Daoism, and folk ritual – was usually left alone or even encouraged as long as it promoted local morality and stability. This imperial stance can be summed up as **pragmatic pluralism**: multiple cults were allowed and patronized to foster loyalty and moral conduct, whereas exclusivist fervor (the kind that might lead to iconoclasm or sectarian violence) was viewed with suspicion. 

Historically, when monotheistic religions did arrive in China, they had to **adapt to this environment**. For example, during the Ming dynasty, Catholic Jesuits attempted to introduce Christianity. The Ming emperors were curious about Western science and appreciated Jesuit knowledge, but they were uncomfortable with Christianity’s exclusive truth claims (such as opposition to ancestor worship). Matteo Ricci, the famous Jesuit, astutely presented Christianity in Confucian-friendly terms – referring to God as *Shangdi* (the old term for High Sovereign) and even arguing that the ancient Chinese indeed worshipped the same Supreme Being. However, the very need for this adaptation underscored how entrenched pluralism was: any religion insisting on sole worship would seem *alien* to Chinese sensibilities and statecraft. Indeed, later Qing emperors banned Christian missions partly because they saw Christians refusing to partake in the broader ritual life (like making offerings to ancestors or the Emperor’s image) – a refusal that smacked of **disloyalty** in the Chinese context. In China, to *not* honor the plurality of duties (to family, emperor, Heaven, and so on) was subversive.

To draw a vivid contrast: in the late Roman Empire, once **Christianity** gained imperial favor, it rather quickly went from being one cult among many to declaring itself the **only true faith** – culminating in Emperor Theodosius’s decree in 380 CE that made Nicene Christianity the state religion and outlawed pagan worship [^cite_36](^cite_36). The Roman paradigm thus shifted from pluralism to monotheistic overcoding within a few generations. Similarly, in Sassanian Persia, **Zoroastrianism** was elevated to state creed; while Zoroastrianism isn’t strictly monotheistic in a Western sense (it’s dualist with Ahura Mazda as supreme good), the Sassanids enforced it to the exclusion of other cults, and non-Zoroastrians faced pressure or persecution [^cite_37](^cite_37). In China, no comparable moment occurred where one religion “won” and others were stamped out. Even the strongly Confucian **neo-orthodoxy** of the Song-Ming period did not stop emperors from praying at Daoist shrines or prevent the populace from worshipping Buddhas. The state’s role as **ritual manager** meant it could incorporate whatever useful symbols and rites were needed, rather than promote a single jealous god. The result was an imperial order that, as historian Benjamin Elman quipped, had “**gods and spirits of all under Heaven**” on its registry, much like it had peoples of all under Heaven under its rule.

## Resisting “Overcoding”: The Deleuzian View

The French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari offer a useful concept to analyze China’s avoidance of monotheism. They speak of **“overcoding”** – a process by which a central authority (a despotic state or a dominant signifier) imposes one code of meaning over all others [^cite_38](^cite_38). Monotheism is an archetypal case of overcoding in the religious sphere: one God, one scripture, one set of laws come to reinterpret or suppress the myriad local gods and cults. In their work *A Thousand Plateaus*, Deleuze and Guattari note that a defining feature of the **state-form** is to elevate a **Master Signifier** (for instance, the One God, or the Emperor as divine) that stands for the whole and marginalizes other sources of value [^cite_39](^cite_39). The **“despotic signifier”** – say a single deity – makes all meaning revolve around itself, and “overcoding consists in the imposition of the regime of meanings” of that one sign on all social interactions [^cite_40](^cite_40). In a monotheistic empire, this might translate to reorganizing society so that worship of the one God penetrates every community, and any ritual not sanctioned by that God’s law is deemed illegitimate. Historically, we can see this in actions like the smashing of idols, the conversion of temples into churches, the outlawing of heterodox rituals – all ways of *destroying or absorbing* the old codes that don’t fit the One.

What makes the Chinese case fascinating is that although China certainly had a powerful centralized state (arguably an even more ancient and bureaucratically effective one than Rome or Persia), it **resisted deploying a monotheistic overcode** in religion. The Chinese state did practice cultural “coding” – for instance, through Confucian ethics taught via state schools and exams – but this coding remained **multiplicious**. We might say the Chinese state overcoded *politics* (by making the Emperor the sole source of authority) but *under-coded* religion, allowing a high degree of local and sectarian variation. The Emperor was the Son of Heaven, yes, but Heaven in China was not a jealous monotheistic God that negated others; Heaven’s sons (the emperors) were explicitly supposed to also honor a whole array of subordinate spirits. In one intriguing sense, the Chinese state even **prevented** overcoding by co-opting any potentially absolutist creed. When Buddhism – which in theory posits ultimate truths (Dharma) that could override worldly authority – arrived, the state managed it by both control and syncretism. Emperors might claim the title of **“Wheel-Turning King”** (Chakravartin) supporting Buddhism, but they also expected Buddhist monks to pray for the dynasty’s well-being and acknowledge the primacy of imperial law. No single religious institution could stand apart and demand exclusive loyalty – certainly not on the scale of, say, the Papacy in medieval Europe. 

The result was a kind of **anti-overcoding** equilibrium. Diversity of belief was not only tolerated but cultivated as a source of strength. As Deleuze and Guattari suggest in a different context, a “rhizomatic” system (one with many centers of growth) is harder to capture by a despotic signifier than a unified tree-like system [^cite_41](^cite_41). Chinese religion, with its rhizome of local cults, lineage rites, monastic traditions, and philosophical schools, never allowed itself to be entirely “treeified” under one doctrine. Even the Chinese language lacked a native term for “religion” as separate from culture until modern times – the various practices were just part of **custom** or **Dao** (Way). In a sense, the **rhizome** of Chinese spirituality ensured that whenever one branch started to dominate, the others would adapt and reassert balance.

Why did China never produce a home-grown monotheism? Scholars cite several factors: 

- **Institutional balance:** The early emergence of a bureaucratic state that claimed the *Mandate of Heaven* meant that no **prophet figure** could supersede the throne. In Israel or Arabia, prophets could challenge kings by invoking a higher God; in China, anyone claiming a new exclusive god would be seen as a rebel against the socio-political order (and usually treated as such). Thus, new religious ideas had to work *with* the existing plural order, not replace it. 

- **Cultural emphasis on harmony:** Chinese philosophy, from Yi Jing divination to Confucian ethics, stressed *harmony and equilibrium*. Extremes were cautioned against. Monotheism, which divides the world starkly into true vs. false gods, believers vs. infidels, was culturally too **radical**. A Confucian dictum might say: “Harmony (和) is the most precious.” This predisposed Chinese society to seek **synthesis** of viewpoints rather than exclusion. The very positive value placed on *he和* (harmonious blending) meant multiple teachings could be seen as complementary flavors rather than mutually exclusive. 

- **No axial-age trauma:** Some scholars argue that monotheism arises out of profound social trauma or moral crisis (e.g. the exilic period for Jews, or the messianic age of early Christians under Roman oppression). China, despite turmoil, maintained a strong continuity of civilization. The absence of a **devastating civilizational collapse** or conquest that delegitimized all previous gods (comparable to the Jewish exile or the fall of Rome) might have removed the impetus for a revolutionary monotheistic movement. Even when dynasties fell, the incoming rulers usually portrayed it as Heaven’s will transferring mandate, not as Heaven declaring all past rituals void.

- **Philosophical realism:** Chinese thinkers tended to be *this-worldly* and pragmatic. They were interested in how to **live well and govern well** here-and-now. Abstract theology about the one true God or the afterlife was not their priority. When such questions did arise (as with Buddhism’s metaphysics), they were integrated into existing frameworks (Neo-Confucian cosmology borrowed much from Buddhist ideas of principle and psychic energy, for instance). This philosophical flexibility kept the **ultimate questions** open-ended, rather than answered by one revelation.

In light of Deleuze and Guattari’s ideas, we could say the Chinese imperial system performed a kind of **controlled coding**: it set general parameters (loyalty to emperor, performance of filial and public rites) but allowed a **play of differences** within those parameters. The “despotic signifier” of the Chinese state was perhaps the Emperor or the imperial law itself, not a deity – and even that signifier did not seek to micromanage personal belief. As long as subjects were *ritually obedient*, their inner cosmologies could remain diverse. Thus, China achieved what D&G might call a line of flight from the typical despotic trap: it harnessed religion to politics without crushing diversity, and it harnessed diversity to politics without losing order.

## Conclusion: Pluralism as Political Virtue

The story of Chinese religion is, in sum, one of **unity without uniformity**. Over more than three millennia, China maintained a civilizational coherence not through a one-God, one-book theology, but through a **shared ritual culture** that could accommodate polytheism, pantheism, and even bits of monotheism (like the abstract Heaven) without succumbing to the rule of **One**. This stands as an optimistic model in comparative political theory and philosophy of religion. It suggests that a complex society can achieve stability and moral order while **embracing multiplicity** – that exclusive monotheism is not an inevitable pinnacle of religious “progress” but a particular path with its own perils (intolerance, dogmatism, the tragic flattening of the sacred landscape). China’s alternative path was to let a hundred spirits bloom under the care of a rational state gardener.

By avoiding monotheistic overcoding, Chinese civilization perhaps also avoided some of the internecine religious conflicts that haunted the West and Middle East. There were no Chinese equivalents of the Crusades or Europe’s wars of religion fought over doctrine. This is not to romanticize China’s past – religious sects could be harshly suppressed if seen as seditious, and some dynasties were less tolerant than others – but overall, the **principle of pluralism** prevailed. The late imperial notion of **“Three Teachings Harmonious as One”** [^cite_42](^cite_42) epitomizes this achievement: rather than reduce the cosmic mystery to a single voice, China orchestrated a **chorus** of voices in dialog. 

In an era where modern states grapple with pluralism, the Chinese historical experience offers a compelling case study. It shows that political unity need not require **theological uniformity**. On the contrary, the Chinese state derived much of its resilience from its ability to adapt to new faiths and absorb them. As the 20th-century philosopher Karl Jaspers noted, the axial-age sages (including Confucius and Laozi) each illuminated different facets of human spiritual potential. China was uniquely able to **keep the lights of multiple sages on** simultaneously. In doing so, it provided a living example of how **cosmic multiplicity** can be preserved within a single world-empire. The avoidance of monotheistic overcoding in China was not an accident, but the result of deliberate values – harmony, tolerance, respect for antiquity – and institutions that favored **ritual ecumenism** over zealotry. This legacy invites us to imagine forms of governance and culture today that might similarly resist the impulse to collapse plurality into a single ideological **One**, fostering instead an environment where many truths can coexist in mutual enrichment.
