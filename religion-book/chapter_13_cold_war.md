# Chapter 13: Cold War - Religion as Anti-Communist Infrastructure (1945-1970)

*[MAJOR FOCUS CHAPTER - Post-1945 Religious-Political Networks]*

**"Christianity and democracy are one and the same." —Abraham Vereide, founder of the National Prayer Breakfast, 1953**

## Introduction: 1945 as the Great Turning Point

The year 1945 marked the definitive transformation of American Christianity from community-centered religious practice to ideology-centered political operation. With the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, Protestant Christianity was systematically weaponized as the spiritual front in the global struggle against communism. This transformation completed Christianity's evolution from the Progressive Era's social reform agenda into a **spiritual-industrial complex** designed for global ideological warfare.

This chapter argues that 1945 represents the moment when "interesting modern religion" begins—when Christianity stops functioning as community infrastructure and starts operating as **extremism selection and ego glorification system**. The Cold War religious apparatus developed three key innovations:

1. **Transnational anti-communist networks** linking American evangelicals, right-wing Catholics, and international religious movements
2. **Business-church partnerships** that merged corporate interests with religious authority  
3. **Psychological warfare techniques** that used spiritual language for political mobilization

These developments created the foundation for contemporary Christian nationalism, the religious right, and the global export of American-style religious politics. Understanding this Cold War transformation is crucial for analyzing how Christianity became the ideological apparatus for American imperial expansion rather than genuine spiritual community.

**Theoretical Framework**: We analyze this transformation through several lenses:
- **Gramsci's concept of "civil society"** - churches as hegemonic institutions for capitalist consensus
- **Foucault's analysis of "pastoral power"** - religious authority adapted for political control
- **Deleuze and Guattari's "war machine"** - religious networks as instruments of imperial expansion
- **Cold War studies** - religion as soft power and cultural warfare tool

## 1. The 1945 Rupture: From Community Religion to Political Religion

### 1.1 The End of Community-Centered Christianity

Before 1945, American Protestant churches functioned primarily as community institutions providing social services, cultural identity, and mutual aid. Even the Progressive Era Social Gospel, despite its institutional expansion, maintained connection to local community needs and democratic reform ideals.

The Cold War transformed this community function into **political function**. Churches became recruitment centers for anti-communist activism, fundraising operations for right-wing causes, and propaganda distribution networks for American foreign policy. The community-serving congregation was replaced by the ideology-serving organization.

This shift was not gradual evolution but sudden rupture caused by specific historical pressures:
- **Nuclear anxiety** created demand for absolute spiritual certainty
- **Suburban expansion** destroyed traditional community networks
- **Anti-communist mobilization** required comprehensive ideological apparatus
- **Corporate expansion** needed religious legitimation for global capitalism

### 1.2 The Suburban Laboratory

Post-war suburbanization provided the perfect environment for developing new forms of political Christianity. Suburban churches were designed from the beginning as lifestyle communities rather than neighborhood institutions. They attracted members through programmatic offerings rather than geographic proximity or traditional denominational loyalty.

Suburban Christianity pioneered techniques that became standard for Cold War religious operations:
- **Market-based membership** - churches competed for adherents like businesses
- **Program-centered identity** - religious experience packaged as consumer product  
- **Professional management** - ministers became program directors and brand managers
- **Political mobilization** - congregations organized as voting blocs and activist networks

The suburban church model proved highly exportable to international contexts where American corporations and military bases needed cultural support systems.

### 1.3 The Psychology of Cold War Christianity

Cold War Christianity developed distinctive psychological appeals designed for anxiety management and identity consolidation. Unlike traditional Christian emphasis on humility and community service, Cold War Christianity emphasized **personal empowerment and national superiority**.

Key psychological innovations included:
- **Certainty provision** - absolute truth claims in uncertain historical moment
- **Enemy identification** - clear external threats (communism) to unite against
- **Success theology** - individual prosperity as evidence of divine favor
- **Nationalism fusion** - American identity merged with Christian identity
- **Therapeutic language** - spiritual healing for middle-class anxieties

These psychological techniques proved highly effective for political mobilization while appearing to offer genuine spiritual benefits.

## 2. The National Prayer Breakfast and Abraham Vereide's Christian Anti-Communist Fellowship

### 2.1 Abraham Vereide and the Fellowship Foundation

Abraham Vereide (1886-1969), a Norwegian-American Methodist minister, created the most influential Cold War Christian organization: the Fellowship Foundation, later known as "The Family." Vereide's innovation was developing **elite Christian networking** as tool for anti-communist political organizing.

In 1935, Vereide founded the first "Prayer Breakfast" in Seattle, bringing together business leaders and politicians for Christian fellowship and anti-labor organizing. By 1942, he had established similar groups in major American cities, always focusing on elite recruitment rather than mass membership.

Vereide's theological innovation was **Christian leadership theory** - the idea that God worked through powerful individuals to shape history rather than through democratic movements or community organizations. This theology provided religious justification for elite political networks while bypassing traditional democratic accountability.

### 2.2 The National Prayer Breakfast: Institutionalizing Elite Christian Politics

In 1953, Vereide convinced President Eisenhower to establish the National Prayer Breakfast as annual White House event bringing together American political leaders and international dignitaries for Christian fellowship and anti-communist strategy coordination.

The National Prayer Breakfast became the flagship institution of Cold War Christianity:
- **Presidential participation** established Christianity as unofficial state religion
- **International attendance** created global network of Christian political leaders  
- **Corporate sponsorship** merged business interests with religious authority
- **Media coverage** promoted Christian nationalism as American foreign policy
- **Security clearance** transformed prayer into classified political operation

The Prayer Breakfast model was exported globally, establishing similar elite Christian networks in countries targeted for American influence operations.

### 2.3 The Family's International Operations

Under Vereide's leadership and his successor Doug Coe, the Fellowship Foundation developed extensive international operations designed to support American foreign policy through Christian elite networking:

**Africa**: Christian leadership training programs for politicians and military officers, often supporting authoritarian regimes aligned with American interests

**Latin America**: Elite prayer groups linking American business interests with local political leaders, particularly during the Central American conflicts of the 1980s  

**Asia**: Christian businessman networks supporting American corporate expansion, especially in South Korea and the Philippines

**Europe**: Cold War alliance building through Christian Democratic parties and anti-communist Catholic organizations

These international operations demonstrated how Cold War Christianity functioned as **soft power imperialism** - using religious authority to build political networks serving American strategic interests.

## 3. The John Birch Society and Grassroots Christian Anti-Communism

### 3.1 Robert Welch and the Militarization of Christian Politics

The John Birch Society, founded by candy manufacturer Robert Welch in 1958, represented the grassroots mobilization of Cold War Christian anti-communism. Unlike the Fellowship Foundation's elite networking, the Birch Society developed **mass membership organization** based on intensive ideological training and local political action.

Welch's innovation was creating **Christian conspiracy theory** as systematic political methodology. The Birch Society taught that communist infiltration of American institutions required constant vigilance and organized resistance by committed Christians defending American freedom.

Key organizational features included:
- **Cell structure** - local chapters organized for security and intensive indoctrination
- **Educational focus** - members required to study anti-communist literature and history
- **Business leadership** - recruited primarily among Protestant business owners and professionals
- **Political action** - systematic campaigns against liberal politicians and policies
- **Media operations** - magazines, speakers bureaus, and film production

### 3.2 Christian Anticommunism and Segregation Defense

The John Birch Society pioneered the fusion of anti-communist ideology with racial segregation defense that became central to Cold War religious politics. Birch Society materials consistently portrayed civil rights activism as communist infiltration designed to weaken American society.

This ideological fusion proved highly effective for mobilizing white Protestant resistance to racial integration while maintaining religious respectability:
- **School integration** opposed as communist educational policy
- **Voting rights** attacked as communist political manipulation  
- **Economic integration** condemned as communist wealth redistribution
- **Cultural integration** rejected as communist assault on Christian civilization

The segregation-anticommunism synthesis created lasting alliance between white evangelical churches and right-wing political movements that continues to shape American religious politics.

### 3.3 The Birch Society's Institutional Legacy

While the John Birch Society's membership peaked in the 1960s, its organizational methods and ideological frameworks became standard features of American conservative Christianity:

**Media operations**: Conservative Christian broadcasting, publishing, and film production modeled on Birch Society methods

**Educational systems**: Christian schools and homeschooling movements incorporated Birch Society curricula and teaching methods

**Political organizing**: Conservative Christian political action adapted Birch Society cell structure and campaign techniques

**Conspiracy methodology**: Contemporary Christian nationalism continues using Birch Society-style conspiracy theories about liberal infiltration and communist influence

The Birch Society's transformation of Christianity into political ideology provided the organizational foundation for the Religious Right's emergence in the 1970s.

## 4. The Unification Church and Transnational Religious-Political Networks

### 4.1 Sun Myung Moon and Anti-Communist Theology

The Unification Church, founded by Korean religious entrepreneur Sun Myung Moon in 1954, represented the international expansion of Cold War religious-political networking. Moon developed comprehensive **anti-communist theology** that merged Korean nationalism, American foreign policy, and Christian millennial expectations.

Moon's theological innovation was **restoration theory** - the idea that God's work in history required defeating communism to establish divine kingdom on earth. This theology provided religious justification for extensive political operations in support of American Cold War objectives.

Key theological elements included:
- **Historical determinism** - God's plan required American victory over communism
- **National mission** - Korea as crucial battlefield in cosmic struggle  
- **Elite leadership** - True Family (Moon's organization) as vanguard of divine restoration
- **Economic integration** - business success as evidence of spiritual authority
- **Political action** - religious duty to support anti-communist politicians and policies

### 4.2 The Unification Church's American Operations

Beginning in the 1960s, Moon established extensive American operations designed to support conservative Christian political movements and Republican Party politicians:

**Media investments**: Moon acquired the Washington Times newspaper, Insight magazine, and numerous other media properties to promote conservative political messaging

**Political organizing**: Unification Church members provided volunteer labor for conservative political campaigns and Republican Party operations

**Business networks**: Moon's corporate empire (manufacturing, real estate, media) created economic relationships with American business and political leaders

**Educational institutions**: Universities and think tanks promoted anti-communist scholarship and conservative policy research

**International conferences**: World League for Freedom and Democracy and similar organizations brought together global anti-communist religious and political leaders

### 4.3 The KCIA Connection and Religious Intelligence Operations

The Unification Church's operations in America were closely connected to Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) activities designed to influence American politics in support of South Korean military regimes. This connection revealed how Cold War religious organizations functioned as **intelligence assets** rather than purely spiritual institutions.

Congressional investigations in the 1970s documented extensive connections between Moon's organization, KCIA operations, and American political leaders:
- **Koreagate scandal** exposed systematic bribery of American politicians through religious front organizations
- **Tax evasion cases** revealed illegal financial flows between international religious operations and political activities  
- **Influence operations** demonstrated how religious authority provided cover for foreign intelligence activities

The Unification Church case study illustrates how Cold War Christianity became integrated with intelligence operations and foreign policy implementation rather than functioning as independent religious movement.

## 5. Opus Dei and International Catholic Anti-Communism

### 5.1 Josemaría Escrivá and Corporate Spirituality

Opus Dei, founded by Spanish priest Josemaría Escrivá in 1928, became the Catholic equivalent of Protestant Cold War religious-political organizing. Escrivá developed **corporate spirituality** that merged traditional Catholic devotion with modern business methods and anti-communist politics.

Escrivá's innovation was creating **lay Catholic elite networking** that could influence secular institutions while maintaining religious authority. Opus Dei members infiltrated business, academic, political, and media institutions to promote conservative Catholic values and anti-communist policies.

Key organizational features included:
- **Professional integration** - members maintained careers while serving organizational objectives
- **Ideological training** - intensive spiritual direction combined with political indoctrination  
- **Corporate structure** - hierarchical organization modeled on business corporations
- **International operations** - coordinated activities across national boundaries
- **Elite recruitment** - focused on influential professionals rather than mass membership

### 5.2 Opus Dei's Cold War Political Operations

During the Cold War, Opus Dei became crucial component of international anti-communist networks, particularly in Latin America and Europe:

**Spain**: Opus Dei members dominated Franco regime economic policy, implementing neoliberal reforms while supporting authoritarian political control

**Latin America**: Opus Dei networks supported military coups and authoritarian regimes that aligned with American foreign policy objectives

**United States**: Opus Dei influence operations targeted American Catholic institutions, conservative think tanks, and Republican Party networks

**Vatican**: Opus Dei lobbying contributed to Catholic Church's official anti-communist positions and support for American foreign policy

**International finance**: Opus Dei-connected banks and investment firms facilitated capital flows supporting anti-communist governments and movements

### 5.3 Neoliberal Catholic Politics

Opus Dei pioneered the integration of conservative Catholic theology with neoliberal economic policy that became standard for Cold War religious-political movements. This synthesis combined traditional Catholic social teaching with free-market economics and authoritarian political methods.

Key ideological innovations included:
- **Market theology** - free markets as expression of divine providence
- **Corporate hierarchy** - business leadership as Christian vocation  
- **Anti-socialism** - economic inequality as natural and morally necessary
- **Family values** - traditional gender roles supporting capitalist social reproduction
- **Cultural conservatism** - religious tradition as foundation for political authority

This neoliberal Catholic synthesis provided ideological foundation for right-wing Christian political movements worldwide, demonstrating how Cold War Christianity adapted to serve corporate capitalist expansion rather than traditional religious community needs.

## 6. The Prosperity Gospel and Cold War Therapeutic Christianity

### 6.1 Norman Vincent Peale and Positive Thinking

Norman Vincent Peale's "Power of Positive Thinking" (1952) represented Cold War Christianity's adaptation to suburban middle-class psychological needs. Peale transformed traditional Christian theology into **therapeutic ideology** focused on individual success and anxiety management rather than community service or social justice.

Peale's innovation was merging Christian language with business psychology and consumer marketing techniques. His message appealed to suburban professionals seeking religious authority for competitive individualism and material acquisition.

Key ideological elements included:
- **Success theology** - faith as technique for achieving personal goals
- **Anxiety management** - prayer as psychological therapy for middle-class worries  
- **Corporate integration** - Christianity as business success strategy
- **Anti-intellectualism** - simple faith superior to complex theology or social analysis
- **American optimism** - positive thinking as patriotic duty during Cold War

### 6.2 Oral Roberts and Pentecostal Prosperity

Oral Roberts pioneered the integration of Pentecostal healing ministry with prosperity theology, creating **charismatic capitalism** that combined supernatural experience with material success expectations. Roberts' television ministry reached millions of viewers with message that faith could produce both spiritual and economic benefits.

Roberts' theological innovations included:
- **Seed faith** - financial contributions to ministry as investment in divine blessing
- **Healing and wealth** - physical healing connected to financial prosperity
- **Television evangelism** - mass media as primary method for religious instruction
- **University building** - educational institutions as proof of religious authority
- **Business partnerships** - corporate relationships supporting ministry expansion

The Roberts model became template for contemporary megachurch pastors and televangelists who combine charismatic religious experience with prosperity teaching and conservative political activism.

### 6.3 The Therapeutic Turn in Cold War Christianity

The prosperity gospel represented broader transformation of American Christianity from community-oriented social religion to individually-oriented therapeutic religion designed for middle-class consumer society:

**Psychological focus**: Religion repackaged as mental health treatment for modern anxiety and depression

**Consumer orientation**: Churches competing in spiritual marketplace by offering attractive lifestyle products

**Success validation**: Religious authority measured by material prosperity rather than community service or spiritual wisdom

**Political quietism**: Individual spiritual development replacing social activism and political engagement

**Global export**: American therapeutic Christianity promoted internationally as alternative to liberation theology and social justice movements

This therapeutic transformation prepared Christianity for complete integration with consumer capitalism while maintaining appearance of spiritual authenticity.

## 7. Segregation Academies and the Religious Right Infrastructure

### 7.1 White Flight and Christian School Movement

The Supreme Court's Brown v. Board decision (1954) and subsequent civil rights legislation triggered massive white Protestant resistance organized through **Christian education** institutions designed to maintain racial segregation while claiming religious motivation.

Christian schools founded in the 1960s-70s provided infrastructure for white supremacist politics disguised as religious freedom:
- **Tax exemption** - religious institutions avoided taxes while maintaining segregation
- **Curriculum control** - Christian education justified teaching white supremacist ideology
- **Community organization** - school networks created political mobilization systems
- **Leadership training** - Christian school graduates became conservative political activists
- **Legal strategy** - religious freedom claims protected segregationist institutions

### 7.2 Jerry Falwell and the Lynchburg Christian Academy Model

Jerry Falwell's Lynchburg Christian Academy (1967) became the prototype for segregation academies throughout the South. Falwell explicitly founded the school to avoid racial integration while maintaining fundamentalist Christian respectability.

Falwell's innovations included:
- **Religious justification** - segregation defended as biblical teaching rather than racial prejudice
- **Independent Baptist network** - denominational structure supporting segregationist institutions  
- **Media ministry** - television and radio promoting Christian school movement
- **Political organization** - school networks mobilized for conservative political campaigns
- **Legal defense** - religious freedom litigation protecting segregationist institutions

The Lynchburg model spread rapidly throughout white evangelical communities, creating institutional infrastructure that became foundation for Religious Right political organizing in the 1970s.

### 7.3 From Segregation to Abortion: Issue Evolution

By the late 1970s, explicit racial segregation became politically impossible, forcing Christian Right organizations to develop alternative mobilization strategies. The anti-abortion movement provided perfect replacement issue that maintained white evangelical political unity while claiming moral rather than racial motivation.

This transition from segregation to abortion activism demonstrated how Cold War religious politics adapted to changing social conditions:
- **Same infrastructure** - segregation academy networks repurposed for anti-abortion organizing
- **Same personnel** - white evangelical leaders transferred from racial to reproductive politics
- **Same methods** - religious freedom claims, media campaigns, and political mobilization
- **Same objectives** - maintaining white middle-class cultural dominance through religious authority
- **Same networks** - business-church partnerships supporting conservative political movements

The abortion issue evolution revealed how Cold War Christianity functioned as **white identity politics** disguised as religious conviction rather than genuine theological movement.

## 8. Media Ministries and the Commercialization of Christianity

### 8.1 Religious Broadcasting and Political Messaging

Cold War Christianity pioneered the systematic use of electronic media for political mobilization disguised as religious programming. Religious broadcasting networks became crucial infrastructure for conservative political messaging and fundraising operations.

Key developments included:
- **FCC religious exemptions** - broadcast regulations allowed political content in religious programming
- **Satellite technology** - national religious networks bypassed local media control
- **Direct mail integration** - broadcast programming connected to fundraising databases  
- **Political coordination** - religious broadcasters received Republican Party talking points
- **Issue advocacy** - religious programming promoted specific political positions and candidates

### 8.2 Pat Robertson and the 700 Club Model

Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network (1961) and 700 Club program (1966) established the template for religious-political media operations that combined charismatic Christianity with conservative political advocacy.

Robertson's innovations included:
- **News format** - religious programming packaged as journalism and political commentary
- **Prosperity fundraising** - viewer donations solicited with promises of divine blessing
- **Political candidate interviews** - religious program platform for conservative politicians
- **University development** - Regent University training conservative Christian professionals
- **Presidential campaign** - direct transition from religious broadcasting to political candidacy

The Robertson model demonstrated how religious media authority could be converted directly into political power through systematic audience development and message coordination.

### 8.3 The Trinity Broadcasting Network and Therapeutic Capitalism

Paul and Jan Crouch's Trinity Broadcasting Network (1973) represented the complete commercialization of Cold War Christianity through **therapeutic capitalism** that merged Pentecostal experience with prosperity theology and conservative politics.

TBN's programming philosophy combined:
- **Charismatic experience** - supernatural religious phenomena as entertainment product
- **Prosperity teaching** - financial success as evidence of spiritual authority  
- **Conservative politics** - Republican Party messaging integrated with religious content
- **Celebrity culture** - religious leaders promoted as lifestyle brands and entertainment personalities
- **Global expansion** - American religious-political programming exported internationally

TBN's success revealed how Cold War Christianity had evolved into **spiritual entertainment industry** serving consumer capitalism rather than religious community needs.

## 9. International Expansion: Exporting American Religious Politics

### 9.1 World Vision and Humanitarian Imperialism

World Vision, founded by Bob Pierce in 1950, pioneered the integration of Christian humanitarian work with American foreign policy objectives, creating **humanitarian imperialism** that used charitable work to promote American political and economic interests globally.

World Vision's operations demonstrated how Cold War Christianity functioned as soft power tool:
- **Refugee services** - humanitarian work supporting American-allied governments and military operations
- **Development programs** - economic assistance promoting capitalist integration and American corporate access
- **Child sponsorship** - individual donor relationships creating emotional investment in American foreign policy
- **Evangelical missions** - religious conversion work supporting American cultural influence  
- **Political lobbying** - humanitarian authority used to advocate for conservative foreign policy positions

### 9.2 Campus Crusade and Student Mobilization

Campus Crusade for Christ, founded by Bill Bright in 1951, represented systematic effort to mobilize American college students for Christian anti-communist activism through **evangelical political organizing** disguised as campus ministry.

Campus Crusade innovations included:
- **Student recruitment** - targeting future political and business leaders during college years
- **Political training** - leadership development programs combining religious and political education
- **International expansion** - student movements supporting American interests in developing countries
- **Media production** - films and publications promoting conservative Christian political messaging
- **Corporate partnerships** - business leader involvement in student ministry operations

The Campus Crusade model was exported globally, establishing American-controlled Christian student movements that supported American foreign policy objectives while claiming religious motivation.

### 9.3 Latin American Operations and Liberation Theology Opposition

Cold War Christian organizations developed extensive Latin American operations designed to counter liberation theology and support American-allied governments and business interests:

**Theological opposition**: Conservative evangelical theology promoted to counter Catholic liberation theology emphasis on social justice and economic equality

**Political support**: Christian organizations providing ideological legitimation for military coups and authoritarian regimes aligned with American interests

**Economic integration**: Christian business networks facilitating American corporate expansion and neoliberal economic policies

**Cultural penetration**: American-style evangelical Christianity promoted as alternative to traditional Catholic social teaching

**Intelligence cooperation**: Christian organizations providing information and operational support for American intelligence activities

These Latin American operations demonstrated how Cold War Christianity functioned as **cultural imperialism** designed to subordinate developing nations to American political and economic control.

## 10. Theoretical Analysis: Christianity as Imperial War Machine

### 10.1 Deleuze and Guattari: The Religious War Machine

Using Deleuze and Guattari's concept of "war machine," Cold War Christianity can be analyzed as **imperial war machine** designed for global ideological conquest rather than spiritual community development:

**Deterritorialization**: Christianity extracted from local community contexts and reorganized as transnational political operation

**Reterritorialization**: Religious authority redirected toward supporting American imperial expansion and capitalist development

**Overcoding**: Christian theological language used to justify and legitimate political and economic objectives

**Smooth space creation**: Global religious networks bypassing national sovereignty and democratic accountability

**Capture by apparatus**: Spiritual practices subordinated to political and economic instrumental purposes

This analysis reveals how Cold War Christianity functioned as technology of imperial control rather than authentic religious expression.

### 10.2 Gramsci: Religion as Hegemonic Civil Society Institution

Gramsci's analysis of civil society institutions illuminates Cold War Christianity's function as **hegemonic apparatus** generating popular consent for American imperial expansion and capitalist development:

**Cultural leadership**: Religious authority providing moral legitimation for political and economic policies

**Ideological integration**: Christian worldview incorporating anti-communist, pro-capitalist, and pro-American political positions

**Organic intellectuals**: Religious leaders functioning as cultural intermediaries between elite interests and popular constituencies  

**Passive revolution**: Religious reform channeling social discontent into support for existing power structures

**International extension**: American Christian hegemonic institutions exported globally to create cultural foundation for American dominance

This framework demonstrates how Cold War Christianity served imperial hegemonic functions rather than providing spiritual liberation or community development.

### 10.3 Foucault: Pastoral Power and Population Management

Foucault's analysis of pastoral power reveals how Cold War Christianity developed techniques of **population management** that combined spiritual authority with political control:

**Subjectification**: Christian identity formation producing subjects oriented toward individual success rather than collective action

**Normalization**: Religious teaching establishing behavioral norms supporting capitalist social reproduction  

**Surveillance**: Christian community structures facilitating monitoring and control of member behavior and political attitudes

**Confession**: Therapeutic religious practices extracting personal information useful for political and economic manipulation

**Governmentality**: Religious institutions functioning as mechanisms of governmental control operating through claimed spiritual authority

This analysis reveals how Cold War Christianity pioneered techniques of social control later adopted by secular institutions and corporations.

## 11. The Transformation Complete: From Community to Corporation

### 11.1 The Death of Community Christianity

By 1970, the transformation of American Christianity from community institution to political corporation was essentially complete. Traditional functions of religious community—mutual aid, cultural preservation, democratic participation, social criticism—had been largely abandoned in favor of:

**Political mobilization**: Churches as recruitment centers for conservative political movements

**Consumer service**: Religious programming designed to meet individual lifestyle needs rather than community development

**Corporate partnership**: Church-business alliances supporting capitalist expansion rather than economic justice

**Therapeutic function**: Religious authority providing individual anxiety management rather than social transformation

**Imperial support**: Christian institutions serving American foreign policy rather than global spiritual community

### 11.2 The Megachurch as Corporate Template

The megachurch model that emerged in the 1970s represented the logical culmination of Cold War Christianity's corporate transformation:

**Market orientation**: Churches competing for customers rather than serving geographic communities

**Professional management**: Pastors functioning as CEOs rather than spiritual guides

**Brand development**: Religious identity marketed as lifestyle choice rather than community membership

**Franchising**: Successful church models replicated nationally rather than emerging from local contexts  

**Political networking**: Megachurches serving as hubs for conservative political organizing and fundraising

The megachurch model was exported globally as template for "successful" Christianity, spreading American-style religious corporatism worldwide.

### 11.3 Extremism Selection and Ego Glorification

Cold War Christianity's emphasis on individual success, political certainty, and cultural superiority created systematic **extremism selection** that rewarded the most aggressive and narcissistic personalities with religious authority:

**Charismatic leadership**: Religious authority based on personal magnetism rather than theological knowledge or community service

**Certainty worship**: Absolute truth claims attracting psychologically rigid personalities

**Success theology**: Material prosperity validating religious authority regardless of community impact  

**Enemy identification**: Anti-communist and later anti-liberal politics providing outlet for aggressive impulses

**Media amplification**: Religious broadcasting rewarding theatrical personality over spiritual wisdom

This extremism selection process explains how Cold War Christianity produced the toxic leadership patterns that characterize contemporary American religious politics.

## 12. Conclusion: The Cold War Legacy

The Cold War transformation of American Christianity from 1945-1970 created the institutional, ideological, and psychological foundations for contemporary religious politics. This transformation explains:

### 12.1 The Religious Right's Political Success

The Religious Right of the 1970s-80s succeeded because Cold War Christianity had already created comprehensive infrastructure for religious-political organizing:
- **Institutional networks** - churches, schools, media operations, and business partnerships
- **Trained leadership** - professionally educated religious-political entrepreneurs  
- **Ideological coherence** - systematic synthesis of Christianity, capitalism, and nationalism
- **Psychological appeal** - therapeutic religion for middle-class anxiety and identity needs
- **Global reach** - international religious networks supporting American political objectives

### 12.2 Contemporary Christian Nationalism

Contemporary Christian nationalism represents the logical development of Cold War Christianity's basic premises:
- **American exceptionalism** as religious doctrine
- **Political absolutism** justified by divine authority  
- **Corporate partnership** between religious and business interests
- **Media manipulation** using religious authority for political messaging
- **International expansion** of American religious-political model

### 12.3 The Impossibility of Reform

Understanding Cold War Christianity's transformation reveals why efforts to reform American Christianity toward social justice or community service have largely failed:

**Structural integration**: Churches are now structurally integrated with capitalist and imperial systems rather than community needs

**Personnel selection**: Religious leadership positions reward political and entrepreneurial skills rather than spiritual wisdom or community service

**Financial dependence**: Church budgets depend on wealthy donors and corporate partnerships rather than member contributions  

**Ideological coherence**: Cold War synthesis of Christianity, capitalism, and nationalism provides compelling worldview for middle-class Americans

**Global investment**: American Christianity's international expansion creates institutional investment in maintaining imperial religious model

**The Cold War transformation thus represents not temporary aberration but fundamental restructuring of Christianity to serve imperial capitalist expansion. This restructuring makes Christianity part of the problem rather than source of solutions for contemporary social and ecological crises.**

**As we move toward the Internet age (Chapter 14) and our final analysis (Chapter 15), we see how this Cold War religious infrastructure adapts to new technological and social conditions while maintaining its basic function as spiritual support system for American empire and global capitalism.**
