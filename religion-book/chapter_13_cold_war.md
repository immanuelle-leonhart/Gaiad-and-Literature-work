# Chapter 13: Cold War - Religion as Anti-Communist Infrastructure (1945-1970)

*[MAJOR FOCUS CHAPTER - Post-1945 Religious-Political Networks]*

**"Christianity and democracy are one and the same." —Abraham Vereide, founder of the National Prayer Breakfast, 1953**

## Introduction: 1945 as the Great Turning Point

The year 1945 marked the definitive transformation of American Christianity from community-centered religious practice to ideology-centered political operation. With the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, Protestant Christianity was systematically weaponized as the spiritual front in the global struggle against communism. This transformation completed Christianity's evolution from the Progressive Era's social reform agenda into a **spiritual-industrial complex** designed for global ideological warfare.

This chapter argues that 1945 represents the moment when "interesting modern religion" begins—when Christianity stops functioning as community infrastructure and starts operating as **extremism selection and ego glorification system**. The Cold War religious apparatus developed three key innovations:

1. **Transnational anti-communist networks** linking American evangelicals, right-wing Catholics, and international religious movements
2. **Business-church partnerships** that merged corporate interests with religious authority  
3. **Psychological warfare techniques** that used spiritual language for political mobilization

These developments created the foundation for contemporary Christian nationalism, the religious right, and the global export of American-style religious politics. Understanding this Cold War transformation is crucial for analyzing how Christianity became the ideological apparatus for American imperial expansion rather than genuine spiritual community.

**Theoretical Framework**: We analyze this transformation through several lenses:
- **Gramsci's concept of "civil society"** - churches as hegemonic institutions for capitalist consensus
- **Foucault's analysis of "pastoral power"** - religious authority adapted for political control
- **Deleuze and Guattari's "war machine"** - religious networks as instruments of imperial expansion
- **Cold War studies** - religion as soft power and cultural warfare tool

## 1. The 1945 Rupture: From Community Religion to Political Religion

### 1.1 The End of Community-Centered Christianity

Before 1945, American Protestant churches functioned primarily as community institutions providing social services, cultural identity, and mutual aid. Even the Progressive Era Social Gospel, despite its institutional expansion, maintained connection to local community needs and democratic reform ideals.

The Cold War transformed this community function into **political function**. Churches became recruitment centers for anti-communist activism, fundraising operations for right-wing causes, and propaganda distribution networks for American foreign policy. The community-serving congregation was replaced by the ideology-serving organization.

This shift was not gradual evolution but sudden rupture caused by specific historical pressures:
- **Nuclear anxiety** created demand for absolute spiritual certainty
- **Suburban expansion** destroyed traditional community networks
- **Anti-communist mobilization** required comprehensive ideological apparatus
- **Corporate expansion** needed religious legitimation for global capitalism

### 1.2 The Suburban Laboratory

Post-war suburbanization provided the perfect environment for developing new forms of political Christianity. Suburban churches were designed from the beginning as lifestyle communities rather than neighborhood institutions. They attracted members through programmatic offerings rather than geographic proximity or traditional denominational loyalty.

Suburban Christianity pioneered techniques that became standard for Cold War religious operations:
- **Market-based membership** - churches competed for adherents like businesses
- **Program-centered identity** - religious experience packaged as consumer product  
- **Professional management** - ministers became program directors and brand managers
- **Political mobilization** - congregations organized as voting blocs and activist networks

The suburban church model proved highly exportable to international contexts where American corporations and military bases needed cultural support systems.

### 1.3 The Psychology of Cold War Christianity

Cold War Christianity developed distinctive psychological appeals designed for anxiety management and identity consolidation. Unlike traditional Christian emphasis on humility and community service, Cold War Christianity emphasized **personal empowerment and national superiority**.

Key psychological innovations included:
- **Certainty provision** - absolute truth claims in uncertain historical moment
- **Enemy identification** - clear external threats (communism) to unite against
- **Success theology** - individual prosperity as evidence of divine favor
- **Nationalism fusion** - American identity merged with Christian identity
- **Therapeutic language** - spiritual healing for middle-class anxieties

These psychological techniques proved highly effective for political mobilization while appearing to offer genuine spiritual benefits.

## 2. The National Prayer Breakfast and Abraham Vereide's Christian Anti-Communist Fellowship

### 2.1 Abraham Vereide and the Fellowship Foundation

Abraham Vereide (1886-1969), a Norwegian-American Methodist minister, created the most influential Cold War Christian organization: the Fellowship Foundation, later known as "The Family." Vereide's innovation was developing **elite Christian networking** as tool for anti-communist political organizing.

In 1935, Vereide founded the first "Prayer Breakfast" in Seattle, bringing together business leaders and politicians for Christian fellowship and anti-labor organizing. By 1942, he had established similar groups in major American cities, always focusing on elite recruitment rather than mass membership.

Vereide's theological innovation was **Christian leadership theory** - the idea that God worked through powerful individuals to shape history rather than through democratic movements or community organizations. This theology provided religious justification for elite political networks while bypassing traditional democratic accountability.

### 2.2 The National Prayer Breakfast: Institutionalizing Elite Christian Politics

In 1953, Vereide convinced President Eisenhower to establish the National Prayer Breakfast as annual White House event bringing together American political leaders and international dignitaries for Christian fellowship and anti-communist strategy coordination.

The National Prayer Breakfast became the flagship institution of Cold War Christianity:
- **Presidential participation** established Christianity as unofficial state religion
- **International attendance** created global network of Christian political leaders  
- **Corporate sponsorship** merged business interests with religious authority
- **Media coverage** promoted Christian nationalism as American foreign policy
- **Security clearance** transformed prayer into classified political operation

The Prayer Breakfast model was exported globally, establishing similar elite Christian networks in countries targeted for American influence operations.

### 2.3 The Family's International Operations

Under Vereide's leadership and his successor Doug Coe, the Fellowship Foundation developed extensive international operations designed to support American foreign policy through Christian elite networking:

**Africa**: Christian leadership training programs for politicians and military officers, often supporting authoritarian regimes aligned with American interests

**Latin America**: Elite prayer groups linking American business interests with local political leaders, particularly during the Central American conflicts of the 1980s  

**Asia**: Christian businessman networks supporting American corporate expansion, especially in South Korea and the Philippines

**Europe**: Cold War alliance building through Christian Democratic parties and anti-communist Catholic organizations

These international operations demonstrated how Cold War Christianity functioned as **soft power imperialism** - using religious authority to build political networks serving American strategic interests.

## 3. The John Birch Society and Grassroots Christian Anti-Communism

### 3.1 Robert Welch and the Militarization of Christian Politics

The John Birch Society, founded by candy manufacturer Robert Welch in 1958, represented the grassroots mobilization of Cold War Christian anti-communism. Unlike the Fellowship Foundation's elite networking, the Birch Society developed **mass membership organization** based on intensive ideological training and local political action.

Welch's innovation was creating **Christian conspiracy theory** as systematic political methodology. The Birch Society taught that communist infiltration of American institutions required constant vigilance and organized resistance by committed Christians defending American freedom.

Key organizational features included:
- **Cell structure** - local chapters organized for security and intensive indoctrination
- **Educational focus** - members required to study anti-communist literature and history
- **Business leadership** - recruited primarily among Protestant business owners and professionals
- **Political action** - systematic campaigns against liberal politicians and policies
- **Media operations** - magazines, speakers bureaus, and film production

### 3.2 Christian Anticommunism and Segregation Defense

The John Birch Society pioneered the fusion of anti-communist ideology with racial segregation defense that became central to Cold War religious politics. Birch Society materials consistently portrayed civil rights activism as communist infiltration designed to weaken American society.

This ideological fusion proved highly effective for mobilizing white Protestant resistance to racial integration while maintaining religious respectability:
- **School integration** opposed as communist educational policy
- **Voting rights** attacked as communist political manipulation  
- **Economic integration** condemned as communist wealth redistribution
- **Cultural integration** rejected as communist assault on Christian civilization

The segregation-anticommunism synthesis created lasting alliance between white evangelical churches and right-wing political movements that continues to shape American religious politics.

### 3.3 The Birch Society's Institutional Legacy

While the John Birch Society's membership peaked in the 1960s, its organizational methods and ideological frameworks became standard features of American conservative Christianity:

**Media operations**: Conservative Christian broadcasting, publishing, and film production modeled on Birch Society methods

**Educational systems**: Christian schools and homeschooling movements incorporated Birch Society curricula and teaching methods

**Political organizing**: Conservative Christian political action adapted Birch Society cell structure and campaign techniques

**Conspiracy methodology**: Contemporary Christian nationalism continues using Birch Society-style conspiracy theories about liberal infiltration and communist influence

The Birch Society's transformation of Christianity into political ideology provided the organizational foundation for the Religious Right's emergence in the 1970s.

## 4. The Unification Church and Transnational Religious-Political Networks

### 4.1 Sun Myung Moon and Anti-Communist Theology

The Unification Church, founded by Korean religious entrepreneur Sun Myung Moon in 1954, represented the international expansion of Cold War religious-political networking. Moon developed comprehensive **anti-communist theology** that merged Korean nationalism, American foreign policy, and Christian millennial expectations.

Moon's theological innovation was **restoration theory** - the idea that God's work in history required defeating communism to establish divine kingdom on earth. This theology provided religious justification for extensive political operations in support of American Cold War objectives.

Key theological elements included:
- **Historical determinism** - God's plan required American victory over communism
- **National mission** - Korea as crucial battlefield in cosmic struggle  
- **Elite leadership** - True Family (Moon's organization) as vanguard of divine restoration
- **Economic integration** - business success as evidence of spiritual authority
- **Political action** - religious duty to support anti-communist politicians and policies

### 4.2 The Unification Church's American Operations

Beginning in the 1960s, Moon established extensive American operations designed to support conservative Christian political movements and Republican Party politicians:

**Media investments**: Moon acquired the Washington Times newspaper, Insight magazine, and numerous other media properties to promote conservative political messaging

**Political organizing**: Unification Church members provided volunteer labor for conservative political campaigns and Republican Party operations

**Business networks**: Moon's corporate empire (manufacturing, real estate, media) created economic relationships with American business and political leaders

**Educational institutions**: Universities and think tanks promoted anti-communist scholarship and conservative policy research

**International conferences**: World League for Freedom and Democracy and similar organizations brought together global anti-communist religious and political leaders

### 4.3 The KCIA Connection and Religious Intelligence Operations

The Unification Church's operations in America were closely connected to Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) activities designed to influence American politics in support of South Korean military regimes. This connection revealed how Cold War religious organizations functioned as **intelligence assets** rather than purely spiritual institutions.

Congressional investigations in the 1970s documented extensive connections between Moon's organization, KCIA operations, and American political leaders:
- **Koreagate scandal** exposed systematic bribery of American politicians through religious front organizations
- **Tax evasion cases** revealed illegal financial flows between international religious operations and political activities  
- **Influence operations** demonstrated how religious authority provided cover for foreign intelligence activities

The Unification Church case study illustrates how Cold War Christianity became integrated with intelligence operations and foreign policy implementation rather than functioning as independent religious movement.

## 5. Opus Dei and International Catholic Anti-Communism

### 5.1 Josemaría Escrivá and Corporate Spirituality

Opus Dei, founded by Spanish priest Josemaría Escrivá in 1928, became the Catholic equivalent of Protestant Cold War religious-political organizing. Escrivá developed **corporate spirituality** that merged traditional Catholic devotion with modern business methods and anti-communist politics.

Escrivá's innovation was creating **lay Catholic elite networking** that could influence secular institutions while maintaining religious authority. Opus Dei members infiltrated business, academic, political, and media institutions to promote conservative Catholic values and anti-communist policies.

Key organizational features included:
- **Professional integration** - members maintained careers while serving organizational objectives
- **Ideological training** - intensive spiritual direction combined with political indoctrination  
- **Corporate structure** - hierarchical organization modeled on business corporations
- **International operations** - coordinated activities across national boundaries
- **Elite recruitment** - focused on influential professionals rather than mass membership

### 5.2 Opus Dei's Cold War Political Operations

During the Cold War, Opus Dei became crucial component of international anti-communist networks, particularly in Latin America and Europe:

**Spain**: Opus Dei members dominated Franco regime economic policy, implementing neoliberal reforms while supporting authoritarian political control

**Latin America**: Opus Dei networks supported military coups and authoritarian regimes that aligned with American foreign policy objectives

**United States**: Opus Dei influence operations targeted American Catholic institutions, conservative think tanks, and Republican Party networks

**Vatican**: Opus Dei lobbying contributed to Catholic Church's official anti-communist positions and support for American foreign policy

**International finance**: Opus Dei-connected banks and investment firms facilitated capital flows supporting anti-communist governments and movements

### 5.3 Neoliberal Catholic Politics

Opus Dei pioneered the integration of conservative Catholic theology with neoliberal economic policy that became standard for Cold War religious-political movements. This synthesis combined traditional Catholic social teaching with free-market economics and authoritarian political methods.

Key ideological innovations included:
- **Market theology** - free markets as expression of divine providence
- **Corporate hierarchy** - business leadership as Christian vocation  
- **Anti-socialism** - economic inequality as natural and morally necessary
- **Family values** - traditional gender roles supporting capitalist social reproduction
- **Cultural conservatism** - religious tradition as foundation for political authority

This neoliberal Catholic synthesis provided ideological foundation for right-wing Christian political movements worldwide, demonstrating how Cold War Christianity adapted to serve corporate capitalist expansion rather than traditional religious community needs.

## 6. The Prosperity Gospel and Cold War Therapeutic Christianity

### 6.1 Norman Vincent Peale and Positive Thinking

Norman Vincent Peale's "Power of Positive Thinking" (1952) represented Cold War Christianity's adaptation to suburban middle-class psychological needs. Peale transformed traditional Christian theology into **therapeutic ideology** focused on individual success and anxiety management rather than community service or social justice.

Peale's innovation was merging Christian language with business psychology and consumer marketing techniques. His message appealed to suburban professionals seeking religious authority for competitive individualism and material acquisition.

Key ideological elements included:
- **Success theology** - faith as technique for achieving personal goals
- **Anxiety management** - prayer as psychological therapy for middle-class worries  
- **Corporate integration** - Christianity as business success strategy
- **Anti-intellectualism** - simple faith superior to complex theology or social analysis
- **American optimism** - positive thinking as patriotic duty during Cold War

### 6.2 Oral Roberts and Pentecostal Prosperity

Oral Roberts pioneered the integration of Pentecostal healing ministry with prosperity theology, creating **charismatic capitalism** that combined supernatural experience with material success expectations. Roberts' television ministry reached millions of viewers with message that faith could produce both spiritual and economic benefits.

Roberts' theological innovations included:
- **Seed faith** - financial contributions to ministry as investment in divine blessing
- **Healing and wealth** - physical healing connected to financial prosperity
- **Television evangelism** - mass media as primary method for religious instruction
- **University building** - educational institutions as proof of religious authority
- **Business partnerships** - corporate relationships supporting ministry expansion

The Roberts model became template for contemporary megachurch pastors and televangelists who combine charismatic religious experience with prosperity teaching and conservative political activism.

### 6.3 The Therapeutic Turn in Cold War Christianity

The prosperity gospel represented broader transformation of American Christianity from community-oriented social religion to individually-oriented therapeutic religion designed for middle-class consumer society:

**Psychological focus**: Religion repackaged as mental health treatment for modern anxiety and depression

**Consumer orientation**: Churches competing in spiritual marketplace by offering attractive lifestyle products

**Success validation**: Religious authority measured by material prosperity rather than community service or spiritual wisdom

**Political quietism**: Individual spiritual development replacing social activism and political engagement

**Global export**: American therapeutic Christianity promoted internationally as alternative to liberation theology and social justice movements

This therapeutic transformation prepared Christianity for complete integration with consumer capitalism while maintaining appearance of spiritual authenticity.

## 7. Segregation Academies and the Religious Right Infrastructure

### 7.1 White Flight and Christian School Movement

The Supreme Court's Brown v. Board decision (1954) and subsequent civil rights legislation triggered massive white Protestant resistance organized through **Christian education** institutions designed to maintain racial segregation while claiming religious motivation.

Christian schools founded in the 1960s-70s provided infrastructure for white supremacist politics disguised as religious freedom:
- **Tax exemption** - religious institutions avoided taxes while maintaining segregation
- **Curriculum control** - Christian education justified teaching white supremacist ideology
- **Community organization** - school networks created political mobilization systems
- **Leadership training** - Christian school graduates became conservative political activists
- **Legal strategy** - religious freedom claims protected segregationist institutions

### 7.2 Jerry Falwell and the Lynchburg Christian Academy Model

Jerry Falwell's Lynchburg Christian Academy (1967) became the prototype for segregation academies throughout the South. Falwell explicitly founded the school to avoid racial integration while maintaining fundamentalist Christian respectability.

Falwell's innovations included:
- **Religious justification** - segregation defended as biblical teaching rather than racial prejudice
- **Independent Baptist network** - denominational structure supporting segregationist institutions  
- **Media ministry** - television and radio promoting Christian school movement
- **Political organization** - school networks mobilized for conservative political campaigns
- **Legal defense** - religious freedom litigation protecting segregationist institutions

The Lynchburg model spread rapidly throughout white evangelical communities, creating institutional infrastructure that became foundation for Religious Right political organizing in the 1970s.

### 7.3 From Segregation to Abortion: Issue Evolution

By the late 1970s, explicit racial segregation became politically impossible, forcing Christian Right organizations to develop alternative mobilization strategies. The anti-abortion movement provided perfect replacement issue that maintained white evangelical political unity while claiming moral rather than racial motivation.

This transition from segregation to abortion activism demonstrated how Cold War religious politics adapted to changing social conditions:
- **Same infrastructure** - segregation academy networks repurposed for anti-abortion organizing
- **Same personnel** - white evangelical leaders transferred from racial to reproductive politics
- **Same methods** - religious freedom claims, media campaigns, and political mobilization
- **Same objectives** - maintaining white middle-class cultural dominance through religious authority
- **Same networks** - business-church partnerships supporting conservative political movements

The abortion issue evolution revealed how Cold War Christianity functioned as **white identity politics** disguised as religious conviction rather than genuine theological movement.

## 8. Media Ministries and the Commercialization of Christianity

### 8.1 Religious Broadcasting and Political Messaging

Cold War Christianity pioneered the systematic use of electronic media for political mobilization disguised as religious programming. Religious broadcasting networks became crucial infrastructure for conservative political messaging and fundraising operations.

Key developments included:
- **FCC religious exemptions** - broadcast regulations allowed political content in religious programming
- **Satellite technology** - national religious networks bypassed local media control
- **Direct mail integration** - broadcast programming connected to fundraising databases  
- **Political coordination** - religious broadcasters received Republican Party talking points
- **Issue advocacy** - religious programming promoted specific political positions and candidates

### 8.2 Pat Robertson and the 700 Club Model

Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network (1961) and 700 Club program (1966) established the template for religious-political media operations that combined charismatic Christianity with conservative political advocacy.

Robertson's innovations included:
- **News format** - religious programming packaged as journalism and political commentary
- **Prosperity fundraising** - viewer donations solicited with promises of divine blessing
- **Political candidate interviews** - religious program platform for conservative politicians
- **University development** - Regent University training conservative Christian professionals
- **Presidential campaign** - direct transition from religious broadcasting to political candidacy

The Robertson model demonstrated how religious media authority could be converted directly into political power through systematic audience development and message coordination.

### 8.3 The Trinity Broadcasting Network and Therapeutic Capitalism

Paul and Jan Crouch's Trinity Broadcasting Network (1973) represented the complete commercialization of Cold War Christianity through **therapeutic capitalism** that merged Pentecostal experience with prosperity theology and conservative politics.

TBN's programming philosophy combined:
- **Charismatic experience** - supernatural religious phenomena as entertainment product
- **Prosperity teaching** - financial success as evidence of spiritual authority  
- **Conservative politics** - Republican Party messaging integrated with religious content
- **Celebrity culture** - religious leaders promoted as lifestyle brands and entertainment personalities
- **Global expansion** - American religious-political programming exported internationally

TBN's success revealed how Cold War Christianity had evolved into **spiritual entertainment industry** serving consumer capitalism rather than religious community needs.

## 9. International Expansion: Exporting American Religious Politics

### 9.1 World Vision and Humanitarian Imperialism

World Vision, founded by Bob Pierce in 1950, pioneered the integration of Christian humanitarian work with American foreign policy objectives, creating **humanitarian imperialism** that used charitable work to promote American political and economic interests globally.

World Vision's operations demonstrated how Cold War Christianity functioned as soft power tool:
- **Refugee services** - humanitarian work supporting American-allied governments and military operations
- **Development programs** - economic assistance promoting capitalist integration and American corporate access
- **Child sponsorship** - individual donor relationships creating emotional investment in American foreign policy
- **Evangelical missions** - religious conversion work supporting American cultural influence  
- **Political lobbying** - humanitarian authority used to advocate for conservative foreign policy positions

### 9.2 Campus Crusade and Student Mobilization

Campus Crusade for Christ, founded by Bill Bright in 1951, represented systematic effort to mobilize American college students for Christian anti-communist activism through **evangelical political organizing** disguised as campus ministry.

Campus Crusade innovations included:
- **Student recruitment** - targeting future political and business leaders during college years
- **Political training** - leadership development programs combining religious and political education
- **International expansion** - student movements supporting American interests in developing countries
- **Media production** - films and publications promoting conservative Christian political messaging
- **Corporate partnerships** - business leader involvement in student ministry operations

The Campus Crusade model was exported globally, establishing American-controlled Christian student movements that supported American foreign policy objectives while claiming religious motivation.

### 9.3 Latin American Operations and Liberation Theology Opposition

Cold War Christian organizations developed extensive Latin American operations designed to counter liberation theology and support American-allied governments and business interests:

**Theological opposition**: Conservative evangelical theology promoted to counter Catholic liberation theology emphasis on social justice and economic equality

**Political support**: Christian organizations providing ideological legitimation for military coups and authoritarian regimes aligned with American interests

**Economic integration**: Christian business networks facilitating American corporate expansion and neoliberal economic policies

**Cultural penetration**: American-style evangelical Christianity promoted as alternative to traditional Catholic social teaching

**Intelligence cooperation**: Christian organizations providing information and operational support for American intelligence activities

These Latin American operations demonstrated how Cold War Christianity functioned as **cultural imperialism** designed to subordinate developing nations to American political and economic control.

## 10. Theoretical Analysis: Christianity as Imperial War Machine

### 10.1 Deleuze and Guattari: The Religious War Machine

Using Deleuze and Guattari's concept of "war machine," Cold War Christianity can be analyzed as **imperial war machine** designed for global ideological conquest rather than spiritual community development:

**Deterritorialization**: Christianity extracted from local community contexts and reorganized as transnational political operation

**Reterritorialization**: Religious authority redirected toward supporting American imperial expansion and capitalist development

**Overcoding**: Christian theological language used to justify and legitimate political and economic objectives

**Smooth space creation**: Global religious networks bypassing national sovereignty and democratic accountability

**Capture by apparatus**: Spiritual practices subordinated to political and economic instrumental purposes

This analysis reveals how Cold War Christianity functioned as technology of imperial control rather than authentic religious expression.

### 10.2 Gramsci: Religion as Hegemonic Civil Society Institution

Gramsci's analysis of civil society institutions illuminates Cold War Christianity's function as **hegemonic apparatus** generating popular consent for American imperial expansion and capitalist development:

**Cultural leadership**: Religious authority providing moral legitimation for political and economic policies

**Ideological integration**: Christian worldview incorporating anti-communist, pro-capitalist, and pro-American political positions

**Organic intellectuals**: Religious leaders functioning as cultural intermediaries between elite interests and popular constituencies  

**Passive revolution**: Religious reform channeling social discontent into support for existing power structures

**International extension**: American Christian hegemonic institutions exported globally to create cultural foundation for American dominance

This framework demonstrates how Cold War Christianity served imperial hegemonic functions rather than providing spiritual liberation or community development.

### 10.3 Foucault: Pastoral Power and Population Management

Foucault's analysis of pastoral power reveals how Cold War Christianity developed techniques of **population management** that combined spiritual authority with political control:

**Subjectification**: Christian identity formation producing subjects oriented toward individual success rather than collective action

**Normalization**: Religious teaching establishing behavioral norms supporting capitalist social reproduction  

**Surveillance**: Christian community structures facilitating monitoring and control of member behavior and political attitudes

**Confession**: Therapeutic religious practices extracting personal information useful for political and economic manipulation

**Governmentality**: Religious institutions functioning as mechanisms of governmental control operating through claimed spiritual authority

This analysis reveals how Cold War Christianity pioneered techniques of social control later adopted by secular institutions and corporations.

## 11. The Transformation Complete: From Community to Corporation

### 11.1 The Death of Community Christianity

By 1970, the transformation of American Christianity from community institution to political corporation was essentially complete. Traditional functions of religious community—mutual aid, cultural preservation, democratic participation, social criticism—had been largely abandoned in favor of:

**Political mobilization**: Churches as recruitment centers for conservative political movements

**Consumer service**: Religious programming designed to meet individual lifestyle needs rather than community development

**Corporate partnership**: Church-business alliances supporting capitalist expansion rather than economic justice

**Therapeutic function**: Religious authority providing individual anxiety management rather than social transformation

**Imperial support**: Christian institutions serving American foreign policy rather than global spiritual community

### 11.2 The Megachurch as Corporate Template

The megachurch model that emerged in the 1970s represented the logical culmination of Cold War Christianity's corporate transformation:

**Market orientation**: Churches competing for customers rather than serving geographic communities

**Professional management**: Pastors functioning as CEOs rather than spiritual guides

**Brand development**: Religious identity marketed as lifestyle choice rather than community membership

**Franchising**: Successful church models replicated nationally rather than emerging from local contexts  

**Political networking**: Megachurches serving as hubs for conservative political organizing and fundraising

The megachurch model was exported globally as template for "successful" Christianity, spreading American-style religious corporatism worldwide.

### 11.3 Extremism Selection and Ego Glorification

Cold War Christianity's emphasis on individual success, political certainty, and cultural superiority created systematic **extremism selection** that rewarded the most aggressive and narcissistic personalities with religious authority:

**Charismatic leadership**: Religious authority based on personal magnetism rather than theological knowledge or community service

**Certainty worship**: Absolute truth claims attracting psychologically rigid personalities

**Success theology**: Material prosperity validating religious authority regardless of community impact  

**Enemy identification**: Anti-communist and later anti-liberal politics providing outlet for aggressive impulses

**Media amplification**: Religious broadcasting rewarding theatrical personality over spiritual wisdom

This extremism selection process explains how Cold War Christianity produced the toxic leadership patterns that characterize contemporary American religious politics.

## 12. Conclusion: The Cold War Legacy

The Cold War transformation of American Christianity from 1945-1970 created the institutional, ideological, and psychological foundations for contemporary religious politics. This transformation explains:

### 12.1 The Religious Right's Political Success

The Religious Right of the 1970s-80s succeeded because Cold War Christianity had already created comprehensive infrastructure for religious-political organizing:
- **Institutional networks** - churches, schools, media operations, and business partnerships
- **Trained leadership** - professionally educated religious-political entrepreneurs  
- **Ideological coherence** - systematic synthesis of Christianity, capitalism, and nationalism
- **Psychological appeal** - therapeutic religion for middle-class anxiety and identity needs
- **Global reach** - international religious networks supporting American political objectives

### 12.2 Contemporary Christian Nationalism

Contemporary Christian nationalism represents the logical development of Cold War Christianity's basic premises:
- **American exceptionalism** as religious doctrine
- **Political absolutism** justified by divine authority  
- **Corporate partnership** between religious and business interests
- **Media manipulation** using religious authority for political messaging
- **International expansion** of American religious-political model

### 12.3 The Impossibility of Reform

Understanding Cold War Christianity's transformation reveals why efforts to reform American Christianity toward social justice or community service have largely failed:

**Structural integration**: Churches are now structurally integrated with capitalist and imperial systems rather than community needs

**Personnel selection**: Religious leadership positions reward political and entrepreneurial skills rather than spiritual wisdom or community service

**Financial dependence**: Church budgets depend on wealthy donors and corporate partnerships rather than member contributions  

**Ideological coherence**: Cold War synthesis of Christianity, capitalism, and nationalism provides compelling worldview for middle-class Americans

**Global investment**: American Christianity's international expansion creates institutional investment in maintaining imperial religious model

**The Cold War transformation thus represents not temporary aberration but fundamental restructuring of Christianity to serve imperial capitalist expansion. This restructuring makes Christianity part of the problem rather than source of solutions for contemporary social and ecological crises.**

**As we move toward the Internet age (Chapter 14) and our final analysis (Chapter 15), we see how this Cold War religious infrastructure adapts to new technological and social conditions while maintaining its basic function as spiritual support system for American empire and global capitalism.**

=== Moon Deep Research====



Great, I’ll begin deep research to support and fact-check your chapter on Cold War religious-political infrastructure (1945–1970), with a particular focus on the Unification Church. I’ll also cover the roles of Opus Dei and The Family (Fellowship Foundation), verifying historical claims and gathering strong sources for their political, corporate, and international operations. I’ll let you know when the findings are ready.


# American Christianity as a Cold War Political Instrument (1945–1970)

During the early Cold War, certain religious movements and networks were co-opted or self-driven to serve explicitly political and geopolitical ends. This chapter examines three influential examples – Rev. Sun Myung Moon’s Unification Church, the secretive Fellowship Foundation (“The Family”), and the Catholic organization Opus Dei – to illustrate how American (and allied) Christianity was transformed into a political instrument against communism. We fact-check key claims about their theology, operations, and ties to intelligence and policy, clarifying which popular notions are supported by evidence.

## The Unification Church: Rev. Moon’s Anti-Communist Crusade

**Founding Theology and Anti-Communist Alignment:** The Unification Church was founded in South Korea in 1954 by Rev. **Sun Myung Moon**, whose *Divine Principle* teachings blended messianic Christianity with Korean nationalism. Moon claimed to be chosen by God to complete Jesus’ unfinished work and establish God’s kingdom on earth. A central tenet of his ideology was fierce anti-communism: Moon taught that **communism was a satanic ideology** that had to be defeated as a prerequisite for world salvation. This spiritual stance dovetailed neatly with U.S. Cold War aims. Moon’s movement arose just after the Korean War, and he explicitly positioned his church as an ideological bulwark against communist North Korea and global Marxism. By the late 1960s, the Unification Church even launched an ideological arm called the **International Federation for Victory Over Communism (IFVOC)** (1968) to promulgate fervently anti-communist doctrine.

**Ties to the KCIA and U.S. Intelligence:** Newly declassified evidence strongly supports claims that the Unification Church was **entangled with the South Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA)** from its early years. A February 1963 CIA information report revealed that *“the Unification Church was ‘organized’ by retired Brig. Gen. **Kim Jong Pil**, the founder and first director of the South Korean CIA (KCIA). Kim…has been using the Church, which has a membership of 27,000, as a political tool”*. Kim Jong Pil – a key architect of Gen. Park Chung Hee’s 1961 coup – apparently saw Moon’s church as a useful vehicle for anti-communist mobilization and political influence. Indeed, in May 1963 the new military government in Seoul officially registered the Unification Church as a religious organization (after initial hesitance), suggesting tacit state approval of Moon’s activities. Moon’s close collaborator, Col. **Bo Hi Pak**, was himself a Korean army officer who joined the church in 1957 and, in 1961, was posted to Washington, D.C. as a military attaché **liaising between the KCIA and U.S. intelligence** while also quietly recruiting for Moon’s movement. Multiple South Korean intelligence officers became involved with Moon’s group; for example, Pak’s friend Kim Sang In joined the KCIA and served as Kim Jong Pil’s interpreter before later working for Moon. These overlapping roles indicate a **pattern of Moon’s church serving as an international political proxy** for Seoul’s intelligence apparatus.

American authorities grew concerned about these ties in the 1970s. A U.S. House investigation (Fraser Committee) found *“reliable information that \[Moon] and organizations connected with him maintained operational ties with the government of South Korea, and specifically the Korean Central Intelligence Agency.”* The committee uncovered evidence that the KCIA had even **financed and directed Moon’s activities in the United States**, including a Moon-organized 1974 campaign to support President Nixon during the Watergate scandal. Moon’s “National Prayer and Fast Committee,” which staged pro-Nixon rallies in Washington, D.C., was apparently suggested by Korean intelligence to bolster a U.S. president seen as crucial to Seoul. Moon’s top aide Pak Bo Hi was identified as the key liaison between the church and the KCIA. These findings (later corroborated by press reports and CIA memos) substantiate the claim that the Unification Church **operated in tandem with South Korean intelligence** – effectively functioning as an influence arm of an American-allied regime. In Moon’s defense, church officials denied being anyone’s agent but “God’s,” and indeed no formal prosecution ensued. Nevertheless, the historical record clearly shows significant coordination with intelligence services, validating the characterization of Moon’s church as a Cold War political instrument.

**Political and Business Operations in the U.S. and Abroad:** Under these auspices, the Unification Church rapidly expanded its footprint in America from the 1960s onward. After incorporation in the U.S. in 1963, Moon’s followers established myriad front groups, businesses, and media enterprises that advanced his politico-religious aims. By the 1970s, the church owned fishing companies, real estate, and even arms-manufacturing concerns (Tongil Group in Korea), using commercial profits and devoted donations (especially from Japan) to bankroll its activities. Moon’s enterprises always served a dual purpose: economic self-sufficiency and political influence. Nowhere was this more evident than in **media holdings**. In 1982 (just after our period, but as a direct outcome of 1970s efforts), Moon founded *The Washington Times*, an English-language daily in the U.S. capital, to champion conservative and anti-communist perspectives. The paper was explicitly created as a counterweight to the perceived liberal bias of mainstream media like *The Washington Post*, which Moon’s followers resented for helping oust Nixon. Col. Pak Bo Hi, Moon’s “ubiquitous henchman,” launched *The Washington Times* with **massive subsidies (estimated \$150 million in losses underwritten in the first few years)** – money largely raised from Japanese church members through aggressive fundraising schemes. President Ronald Reagan eagerly welcomed this support: Reagan **praised the Times** and read it daily throughout his presidency, saying *“The American people know the truth – you, my friends at The Washington Times, have told it to them.”* The paper’s staunch anti-Soviet, pro-military editorial line endeared it to U.S. conservatives, illustrating how Moon leveraged media ownership to shape public discourse in alignment with U.S. Cold War objectives.

Beyond media, Moon’s network ran **influence campaigns and front organizations across the globe**. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the church’s political arm **CAUSA International** (founded 1980) became active in Latin America, coordinating with U.S. covert operations against leftist movements. Investigative reporting by Jack Anderson in 1984 confirmed that *“in Central America…it is sometimes difficult to distinguish CIA operatives from Rev. Moon’s disciples,” who worked “in harness” against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua*. CAUSA staff in Honduras provided material aid to Nicaraguan Contra rebels (cash, supplies, even uniforms) and funded trips of rebel leaders to Washington – effectively **“privatizing” aspects of U.S. foreign policy** after Congress cut off official Contra funding. Such activities were not idle boasts; multiple Contra fighters were seen wearing CAUSA gear, and Moon’s organization set up relief fronts for Contra families. In one striking case, Moon’s church **airlifted supplies to Contra camps** just as U.S. government aid ceased, prompting a Pentagon analyst to warn the White House that the “CIA–Moonie connection” could become a scandal. Clearly, the Unification Church by the 1970s had grown into a *transnational political machine*, operating businesses, media, and charities that advanced U.S. and allied anti-communist efforts from Asia to the Americas.

**Relationships with Politicians and Influence Efforts:** Rev. Moon assiduously cultivated ties with prominent right-wing and conservative figures in many countries, including the United States. In 1974, as mentioned, Moon organized mass rallies in support of **President Nixon**, framing the Watergate impeachment push as a satanic communist plot and calling on Americans to “forgive, love and unite” behind Nixon. (The Fraser investigation suggested South Korean officials had a hand in prompting Moon’s pro-Nixon campaign.) Later, Moon befriended the Reagan administration – not only through media support but via direct personal outreach. He hosted lavish banquets and “World Anti-Communist League” conferences attended by U.S. conservatives and foreign anti-Communist fighters. In fact, Moon’s representatives became regular fixtures at the **World Anti-Communist League (WACL)**, a global alliance of anti-communist groups founded in 1966 by Taiwan and South Korea. By the 1980s, WACL’s conferences saw Moon’s aides rubbing shoulders with U.S. military veterans, Central American paramilitary leaders, and right-wing politicians. Such networking gave Moon’s church access to influential circles and further legitimation in the eyes of Cold Warriors. Even beyond 1970, Moon leveraged relationships with figures like former Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke **Kishi** (grandfather of Abe Shinzō) – who had helped Moon’s church establish in Japan in the ’60s – to perform diplomatic favors. In 1984, Kishi personally wrote to President Reagan imploring clemency for Moon’s tax conviction, lauding Reagan for fighting *“New Deal policies…derived from Marxism”*. This extraordinary plea (from a staunch anti-communist ally) underscores how Moon’s religious movement had become entwined with high-level **political lobbying and influence operations** spanning the Pacific.

*Clarifying Myths:* One popular claim is that Rev. Moon himself was a direct **CIA agent**. There’s no evidence Moon was ever on the CIA payroll; however, substantial evidence indicates **Moon acted as an unofficial asset or proxy**, cooperating with intelligence-connected figures (KCIA and possibly CIA liaisons) in furtherance of shared goals. The oft-repeated statement that *“Moon’s church was founded by KCIA director Kim Jong Pil”* originates from the CIA’s 1963 field report. While the church rejects this characterization (Bo Hi Pak derided it as Congress “christening us as KCIA tools”), historians note that the early alliance with Kim Jong Pil was real – though “founded” might overstate it, since Moon had begun his ministry in the late 1940s. A more precise reading is that **Moon’s movement was co-opted by the Park regime** around 1961–63, rather than literally created by it. Another contested claim is the extent of Unification Church involvement in illicit finance (e.g. drug money laundering). Investigations in Uruguay did reveal suspicious deposits by Japanese Moon followers that infused tens of millions of dollars into a church-owned bank. While speculation abounds, hard proof of drug ties is scant. What is documented is the **global flow of funds** from Japan to U.S. and Latin American Moon projects, often in cash, which certainly enabled political ventures like *The Washington Times*. In sum, the Unification Church of the Cold War era stands out as a new religious movement **thoroughly enmeshed in geopolitical intrigue**: it espoused a fervently anti-communist theology aligning with U.S. ideology, forged alliances with intelligence services, built media and business empires to sway public opinion, and acted as a quasi-political actor on the world stage.

## The Family (Fellowship Foundation): Elite Networks and “Spiritual Diplomacy”

**Vereide’s Vision – Ministry to the “Up and Out”:** The Fellowship Foundation, informally known as “The Family,” originated in 1935 when Norwegian immigrant **Abraham Vereide**, a Methodist minister, received what he described as a divine vision in Seattle. Vereide believed God wanted him to **redirect Christianity’s focus to society’s elites** – the “up and out” rather than the down-and-out. Troubled by the Depression-era growth of labor unions and socialist influences, Vereide saw organized labor and Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal as subversive, “un-American” forces undermining Christian civilization. In response, he gathered 19 businessmen in Seattle for an early-morning prayer breakfast in April 1935. These exclusive prayer meetings – pointedly held outside of churches and limited to powerful men – aimed to form **a network of Christian businessmen and public officials united against class warfare and secularism**. Vereide’s founding theology was unabashedly elitist and **anti-labor**: he taught that God’s will was better served by influencing “key men” in positions of authority, who could in turn shape society in Christian terms. As one scholar notes, he enlisted wealthy executives to pray for a solution to “the organized labor problem,” convinced that only by reconciling capitalism with faith (and crushing labor radicalism) could America be saved. This ethos – sometimes described as “Jesus plus nothing” except power – laid the groundwork for a transpartisan, transnational ministry to the **rich and influential**.

**National Prayer Breakfast as Political Tool:** From these humble beginnings, Vereide’s movement spread to other cities and eventually the halls of power in Washington. By 1942–43, he had established prayer groups in the U.S. House and Senate. In 1953, with backing from sympathetic members of Congress and evangelist Billy Graham, Vereide organized the first **Presidential Prayer Breakfast** (later renamed the National Prayer Breakfast) in Washington, D.C.. President Eisenhower initially hesitated to attend, wary of mixing faith and governance, but Graham persuaded him, and Ike delivered remarks on the necessity of prayer. Thus began a tradition: every U.S. president since has participated at least once. The National Prayer Breakfast (NPB) became an annual February gathering of some 3,000 political, business, and religious leaders from around the world. While outwardly a benign, non-partisan event of fellowship, historians observe that from the start the NPB was **“an institutional tool for political and corporate influence.”** It was the public tip of an iceberg: behind the scenes, the Family used the breakfasts to draw foreign leaders, U.S. politicians, and business magnates into private off-site meetings and **“prayer cells”** where relationships – and deals – could be forged away from scrutiny. Indeed, the NPB’s true purpose, as Family insiders admit, was to recruit powerful attendees into more frequent, intimate gatherings where they could *“meet Jesus man to man.”* These small circles of the high and mighty, bound by shared faith, provided a channel for **“shadow diplomacy” and networking outside official protocols**. One journalist aptly described the Prayer Breakfast as *“an international influence-peddling bazaar”* where foreign dignitaries pay lobbyists hefty sums to secure an invitation. In short, the Family transformed prayer into a currency of soft power, leveraging religion to create **backdoor links among global elites**.

**Doug Coe and Global Expansion:** After Abraham Vereide died in 1969, leadership passed to his protégé **Douglas “Doug” Coe**, a quiet but extraordinarily well-connected figure. Coe took the Fellowship’s creed of **“ministering to the powerful”** to new heights. Under Coe (who led until his death in 2017), the Fellowship Foundation greatly expanded its international reach. By the 1970s, Coe and his associates were globe-trotting “ambassadors of faith,” cultivating personal relationships with presidents, prime ministers, generals, and businessmen on every continent. Coe believed in building **“friendships” with key leaders** irrespective of their political system – often preferring those wielding unrestrained power. *“We work with power where we can, build new power where we can’t,”* Coe liked to say. In practice, this meant **befriending authoritarian rulers** so long as they were anti-communist and open to Fellowship influence. During the 1960s–70s, the Family quietly forged ties with some of the most staunchly anti-communist (and often dictatorial) regimes in the developing world. For example, in **Indonesia**, after General **Suharto** seized power in a bloody 1965 coup (killing hundreds of thousands accused of communism), the Family helped organize a prayer group for dozens of Indonesian legislators under Suharto’s patronage. In **Brazil**, during the military dictatorship of Gen. Costa e Silva (1967–69), the Fellowship supported regular fellowship meetings for Latin American leaders, implicitly sanctioning the regime’s hardline anti-communism. Coe or his deputies would visit these strongmen, share prayer, and offer the Fellowship’s services as a **moral-confidential conduit to Washington**.

Through the late Cold War, Coe’s group brokered remarkable behind-the-scenes contacts. At the 1978 NPB, Coe facilitated a *“secret” prayer summit* that helped President Carter initiate a worldwide call to prayer with Egypt’s Anwar Sadat and Israel’s Menachem Begin, softening the ground for Middle East peace talks. Such benign mediation was the exception; more often the Fellowship’s efforts aligned with **U.S. covert policy goals**. In Africa, Coe’s emissaries reached out to the likes of Gen. **Siad Barre** of Somalia – a Soviet-aligned dictator whom the U.S. later courted. In 1981, Family members acted as intermediaries between Barre and pro-Western Kenyan leader Daniel arap Moi, arranging their meeting; soon after, the U.S. dramatically boosted military aid to Somalia as it flipped to the American side. The Fellowship liaison “greased” this diplomatic shift under a spiritual pretext, a contribution Sharlet caustically calls *“the Family’s gift to Somalia,”* noting Barre’s U.S.-backed rule ended in ruin and civil war. In another case, the Fellowship maintained ties with Indonesian President Suharto even as his army brutally occupied East Timor in 1975. Rather than press human rights, Coe’s representatives saw Suharto as a fellow “key man” and apparently **turned a blind eye to atrocities** – viewing them as collateral in an anti-communist crusade. These examples illustrate how Coe internationalized The Family: by the 1980s, it was a **global web of personal relationships among the powerful**, all pledged to a vague devotion to Jesus that conveniently aligned with American geopolitical interests (anti-communism, capitalist development).

**Ideological Messaging – “Jesus Plus Nothing” and Authoritarian Admiration:** The Family’s theology stripped Christianity to its bare essentials in order to appeal across denominational and national lines. Coe preached a concept of *“Jesus plus nothing”* – meaning Jesus’ authority was all that mattered, unencumbered by church doctrine or democratic values. In practice, Coe and Vereide cultivated what has been described as a **“peculiarly authoritarian vision of Jesus”**. They often cited examples of strong, unhesitating loyalty – even in evil causes – as models for Christian discipleship. In a chilling anecdote, Coe would laud **Hitler, Stalin, Mao, or the Mafia’s unity** as illustrative of the kind of obedient, disciplined zeal he wanted for Christ’s followers. This was not praise for genocide, The Family insists, but an acknowledgement of the power of unwavering commitment. Nonetheless, such rhetoric reveals The Family’s *strongman instincts*: Coe believed that **“the elite” are chosen by God to fulfill a divinely ordained plan** and that democracy (and equality) can be obstacles to that plan. Sharlet notes that Family leaders “consider democracy a manifestation of ungodly pride” and prefer to work beyond the “din of vox populi” in crafting relationships among an anointed leadership class. Thus, the Family’s Bible studies often emphasized **biblical leaders and obedience** (King David, for example) over themes of justice or humility. This ideological messaging conveniently reinforced Cold War narratives: capitalism and American power were framed as ordained by God, while mass movements (labor, socialist or even overly democratic ones) were viewed skeptically. The Fellowship’s own internal documents spoke of establishing “one world…in spiritual unity and moral convictions” led by those in commerce, government, and science – essentially a vision of **global theocratic pax Americana**, though couched in benign terms of friendship and prayer.

**Cold War Influence in U.S. and Abroad:** Domestically, The Family embedded itself in the highest echelons of U.S. politics in a mostly non-partisan fashion. It operated behind many innocuous fronts – International Christian Leadership, National Leadership Council, Fellowship House, etc. – intentionally to deflect attention. By the 1960s, dozens of Senators and Congressmen of both parties were involved in Fellowship prayer cells or circles of influence. Notably, some key figures of later conservative politics – such as Senators **Sam Brownback, Chuck Grassley, and Jim Inhofe**, and even Democrats like Hillary Clinton – maintained associations with the Fellowship’s private groups. These relationships often transcended normal political divides, creating a **shadow network of evangelical-oriented policymaking**. For instance, it’s documented that the Family was instrumental in incubating the idea of government “faith-based initiatives” (funding religious groups for social services) long before George W. Bush adopted it – Senators John Ashcroft and Dan Coats (both Family members) introduced such legislation in the 1990s, aided by Fellowship ally Hillary Clinton. In foreign policy, as detailed, the Family played a *supporting role in U.S. Cold War strategy* by connecting American officials with anti-communist foreign leaders under informal, religious auspices. During the Reagan era, for example, the Fellowship helped **introduce U.S. officials to right-wing military leaders in Central America** (like Salvadoran Gen. Vides Casanova and Honduran Gen. Gustavo Álvarez) who were fighting leftist insurgencies. These introductions, done off the books, eased the way for U.S. support to those regimes despite their grim human-rights records. In one public instance, President Reagan sent greetings to the 1985 WACL conference (arranged in part by Fellowship-aligned figures) praising participants for aiding “freedom fighters” worldwide. This imprimatur highlighted how seamlessly the Family’s networks meshed with official U.S. anti-communist efforts by the late Cold War.

*Clarifying Myths:* The Family’s deliberate secrecy has bred many conspiracy theories. Some critics imagine it as a sinister cabal “ruling” Washington. In reality, its influence has been **subtle and relational rather than overtly directive**. It does not issue policy edicts or voting blocs; rather, it **creates channels of influence and trust** that powerful individuals can use. For example, the National Prayer Breakfast itself, while imbued with Christian symbolism, does not directly dictate policy – but it undeniably creates space for “shady dealing, power-brokering and shadow diplomacy” beyond public accountability. The Fellowship’s role in specific scandals has occasionally come to light (e.g. aiding Russian agent Maria Butina’s mingling with U.S. conservatives via the 2017–18 Prayer Breakfast), confirming that **foreign interests have tried to exploit its backchannels**. Another claim is that the Family “supports dictators wholesale.” This is partially true: Fellowship leaders did **express open admiration for the loyalty commanded by Hitler or Stalin** (as a model for Christian devotion), and they **courted numerous authoritarian figures** as brothers in Christ. However, the Family would argue it seeks to “convert” leaders to Jesus, not endorse all their actions. In practice, that distinction blurred – critics note the Family seemed to excuse or ignore the crimes of any leader who joined their prayer circles. Finally, it’s worth noting that *The Family is not a mass organization* and doesn’t involve itself in electoral politics or public preaching. Its power comes from staying **invisible and exclusive**, a conscious strategy to avoid scrutiny as “a target for misunderstanding”. This has largely succeeded: until investigative journalists like Jeff Sharlet obtained internal documents, the Family’s Cold War exploits were mostly unreported. Now, evidence confirms that during 1945–1970 (and beyond), the Fellowship Foundation uniquely blended piety and power – turning American-led Christianity into a transnational political instrument to unite **pro-capitalist, anti-communist elites** in a kind of “prayerful” alliance.

## Opus Dei: Catholic Anti-Communism and Transnational Elites

**Origins in Franco’s Spain:** **Opus Dei** (Latin for “Work of God”) was founded in 1928 by a Spanish Catholic priest, **Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer**, with the mission of sanctifying lay people’s everyday work. Though a religious order, Opus Dei’s footprint has always been largely among lay professionals and intellectuals rather than parish clergy. Its early trajectory was entwined with Spain’s tumultuous politics. During the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), the Catholic Church overwhelmingly sided with **Francisco Franco’s** Nationalists against the secular leftist Republic, which was violently anti-clerical. Escrivá himself had to flee Republican zones to avoid persecution. After Franco’s victory (aided by Hitler and Mussolini), Spain became a **conservative, authoritarian Catholic state** – an environment where Opus Dei could thrive. In the 1940s–50s, Escrivá relocated Opus Dei’s headquarters to Madrid and later Rome, and Franco’s regime gradually permitted Opus Dei members to ascend to influential posts. By the late 1950s, a cadre of Opus Dei-affiliated technocrats became key ministers in Franco’s cabinet. For example, men like Mariano Navarro Rubio and Alberto Ullastres (Opus Dei members) spearheaded economic reforms in 1957, shifting Spain from autarky to a more modern, capitalist economy. These *“Opus technocrats”* were valued by Franco for their managerial skill and staunch anti-communism, even as they were criticized by old-line Falangists. Over Franco’s 36-year rule, **at least 8 Opus Dei members served as ministers**, especially in finance and economic portfolios. This earned Opus Dei a public reputation (deserved or not) as *“Franco’s secret weapon”* in government. It’s true that Opus Dei’s prominence in Franco’s Spain was unprecedented for a Catholic lay group: it essentially acted as **an elite corps within the regime**, emphasizing meritocracy and Catholic orthodoxy, and helping Franco modernize without liberalizing. However, the relationship was complex; not all Opus Dei members supported Franco uncritically. Some, like Rafael Calvo Serer, grew critical of the dictatorship and were exiled in the 1960s. Nonetheless, the general alignment of Opus Dei with the **Francoist project of crushing communism and secular socialism** is well documented. Opus Dei flourished under Franco’s protection, and Franco in turn benefited from Opus Dei’s global Catholic connections and technocratic expertise, which lent his regime a degree of international legitimacy during the Cold War (e.g. Spain joined the UN in 1955 and became a key Western anti-communist bulwark).

**Anti-Communist Catholic Positioning:** Ideologically, Opus Dei in the Cold War stood at the forefront of conservative Catholic anti-communism. The Catholic Church, especially under Popes Pius XII (1939–58) and Paul VI (1963–78), was militantly opposed to communism’s atheism. Opus Dei embraced this stance with fervor. Escrivá taught that *“Communism was the Church’s greatest enemy”* and encouraged members to fight Marxist influence in society. A controversial account (from a former Opus priest) even alleges Escrivá once praised Hitler’s role in thwarting communists, saying *“Hitler against the Jews, Hitler against the Slavs, this means Hitler against Communism”* – a startling claim reflecting the era’s mindset that communism was the ultimate evil (Opus Dei officials have vehemently denied that Escrivá admired Hitler or fascism, citing his documented condemnations of Nazism as “anti-Christian”). What is not disputed is that **Opus Dei positioned itself as a bulwark of traditional Catholicism** in the face of left-wing and liberal trends. In the 1950s–60s, as communist and socialist movements gained ground in Europe, Latin America, and within the Catholic clergy (think Liberation Theology), Opus Dei and its allies championed a counter-current: pro-capitalist, staunchly hierarchical, and intensely devotional. This made Opus Dei a natural ally of the U.S. and other anti-communist powers. For example, in **Italy**, where a strong Communist Party threatened to win elections, Opus Dei members quietly supported Christian Democratic efforts (though Opus Dei as an organization claims to be apolitical). In **Latin America**, Opus Dei established chapters starting in the 1950s (Chile 1950, Argentina 1958, etc.), often winning the patronage of right-leaning business elites and military officers. As revolutionary fervor spread in the 1960s, Opus Dei members in countries like **Chile** explicitly stood against leftist politics. When socialist Salvador Allende was elected President of Chile in 1970, Opus Dei’s network in Chile vehemently opposed his Marxist policies. After Gen. **Augusto Pinochet** led a coup in 1973, *“from the beginning, Opus Dei in Chile latched onto the Pinochet government”* and grew powerful under his rule. Indeed, Pinochet is said to have favored Opus Dei adherents for influential roles; although Opus Dei officially denies that any of its members served in Pinochet’s cabinet, independent journalists have claimed otherwise (notably Hugh O’Shaughnessy reported “many Opus Dei members” in Pinochet’s ministries). The **exact number of Chilean officials who were formal Opus Dei members remains disputed** – Opus Dei’s spokesperson in Chile flatly rejected such reports as “completely false” – but there is no doubt that Pinochet’s regime found ideological kinship with Opus Dei’s conservative Catholicism. The pattern repeats elsewhere: In **Argentina** (1976–83 dictatorship), several key junta advisers and at least one cabinet minister were linked to Opus Dei or similar movements, promoting a doctrine of “National Reorganization” partly grounded in Catholic integralism. Across Latin America, Opus Dei priests and lay figures were often the **harshest critics of liberation theologians** (who sympathized with the poor and sometimes leftist guerrillas), and they gave theological justification to military juntas’ anti-communist crackdowns. This alignment with authoritarian anti-communism significantly advanced U.S. Cold War interests, which saw right-wing regimes as preferable to any Marxist influence.

**Lay Networks and Elite Infiltration:** A hallmark of Opus Dei is its **focus on recruiting and cultivating lay elites** – unlike most Catholic orders, it is not primarily composed of clergy or monastics. Members are doctors, lawyers, engineers, bankers, professors, military officers, etc., who pledge to live out Catholic principles in their professional fields. This strategy naturally lent itself to *“elite infiltration”*: Opus Dei members often kept a low profile but rose to prominence in key sectors, thereby potentially influencing those institutions according to Opus Dei’s conservative values. In Spain, as noted, they permeated the state bureaucracy and academia. In the wider world, Opus Dei set up *campus centers, schools, and think tanks* to groom future leaders. For instance, in the U.S., Opus Dei established a presence by the late 1940s (a center in Chicago in 1949, later others in Boston, New York, D.C.), targeting Catholic students at prestigious universities. Over decades, this bore fruit: by the 1980s, a number of American intellectuals and officials were linked (formally or informally) to Opus Dei. Perhaps most famously, **Justice Antonin Scalia** was close to Opus Dei circles (though not a member, his spiritual retreats were led by an Opus priest), and **FBI Director Louis Freeh** as well as Senator **Sam Brownback** converted to Catholicism under Opus Dei influence in the 1990s. During 1945–1970, such U.S. examples were rarer, but seeds were planted. More directly, Opus Dei collaborated with other Catholic anti-communist networks like the **Knights of Malta**, an order whose members included top U.S. intelligence figures and diplomats in the 1950s–60s. Through overlapping membership, Opus Dei could indirectly channel information and influence. A concrete instance: in 1960, when John F. Kennedy (a Catholic) was running for president, a faction of American Catholics feared he might be too soft on communism. Opus Dei’s U.S. members, although small in number, joined conservative Catholic voices pressuring Kennedy to take a hard anti-communist line (Kennedy indeed campaigned on closing the “missile gap” and later approved anti-Castro operations). In Europe, Opus Dei played a behind-the-scenes role in bolstering anti-communist Catholic politicians. While in Italy the Christian Democrats were led by more mainstream Catholics, Opus Dei’s presence grew in media and education, complementing CIA efforts to prevent Communist electoral victories. In **Latin America**, Opus Dei members founded newspapers and economic institutes that promoted free-market policies and opposition to left-wing populism (for example, in Chile the newspaper *El Mercurio* and think tanks that advised Pinochet’s economic reforms had Opus affiliates). Thus, through a quiet, cell-like approach, Opus Dei built an **international lay network** that permeated influential circles – a network that could be mobilized to resist communism’s advance and to steer national policies in a pro-Western, Catholic-traditional direction.

**Relationship to U.S. Politics, Latin American Regimes, and the Vatican:** During the height of the Cold War, Opus Dei’s interests often intersected with U.S. geopolitical strategy, even if not overtly coordinated. The **United States found value in Catholic anti-communist groups** as soft-power assets, especially in Latin America and Europe. Declassified records show the CIA worked with the Vatican in the late 1940s to funnel support to Catholic politicians in Italy to defeat communists. While Opus Dei is not explicitly named in early CIA documents, its members were certainly among those Catholic networks. In Spain, the U.S. shift from ostracizing Franco (after WWII) to embracing him (as a Cold War ally by 1953) coincided with the rise of Opus technocrats who American officials found much easier to deal with than fascist ideologues. U.S. diplomats in Madrid in the 1950s noted approvingly that the Opus Dei ministers were competent, pro-American, and focused on development; they helped negotiate the Spain-U.S. defense pact that established American bases in Spain in 1953, a critical Cold War alliance. In Latin America, after Cuba’s revolution (1959) and during the tumult of the 1960s, U.S. policy encouraged Latin militaries to take power to prevent communist takeovers. Opus Dei’s doctrine fortuitously provided a moral justification for these anti-communist coups – promoting the idea of a “Christian civilization” against atheistic Marxism. For example, **Bolivia’s 1971 coup leader Col. Hugo Banzer** received ideological support from traditionalist Catholics (some sources suggest Opus Dei influence in Bolivia’s elite), and he hosted WACL conferences with Moon’s and others’ involvement. Opus Dei’s strongest Latin relationship was with **Chile’s Pinochet**: although formal ties remain opaque (and Opus Dei denies direct political role), many observers noted that *“Opus Dei latched onto the Pinochet government”* early on. Pinochet himself, while not an Opus member, was very close to the Chilean Catholic University (a hub of Opus activity) and favored Opus-linked advisors for his neoliberal economic plan. A senior Opus figure, **Pilar Gazmuri**, even served on Chile’s Council of State under Pinochet, and Opus priests became confessors to key regime families. This synergy meant that Opus Dei acted almost as **an unofficial chaplaincy to U.S.-backed regimes**, reinforcing their legitimacy among devout populations.

Within the **Vatican**, Opus Dei’s star also rose in the Cold War context. Pope Paul VI in 1965 granted Opus Dei the status of a secular institute, and later Pope **John Paul II** – a vehement anti-communist who believed in harnessing lay movements against Soviet influence – elevated Opus Dei to a unique **Personal Prelature in 1982**, effectively making it a church jurisdiction without borders. This unprecedented recognition was a reward for Opus Dei’s loyalty and global work. Notably, John Paul II saw Opus Dei (and similar groups) as crucial in the **fight against communism in Eastern Europe** and in countering leftist currents in the Church. Several top Vatican officials in his reign were members or strong supporters of Opus Dei (e.g. Cardinal Angelo Sodano, who had been Nuncio in Chile and was friendly with Opus Dei, became Secretary of State). Opus Dei’s influence in Rome helped shape the Church’s hardline stance in the 1980s (supporting Poland’s Solidarity, condemning liberation theology in Latin America). The Vatican’s alliance with Opus Dei culminated in Escrivá’s rapid canonization as a saint in 2002, just 27 years after his death – a process sped by Vatican insiders over protests from some Catholics who cited his association with Franco. While detractors call Opus Dei a “secret society” manipulating the Church, mainstream historians like John Allen note that Opus Dei **did not monolithically support all right-wing regimes** – its members had diverse views, especially by the 1970s. He estimates Opus Dei Spaniards were split 50/50 on Franco by the end. Still, from 1945–1970, Opus Dei undeniably aligned institutional Catholic energy with the Western anti-communist crusade.

*Clarifying Myths:* Opus Dei has been subject to wild claims (popular novels even depict it as a murderous cult). The reality is more nuanced. It’s true Opus Dei is **highly secretive and disciplined**, which feeds speculation. But many popular accusations – e.g., that Opus Dei “controls the Vatican” or “was a fascist puppet-master” – are **not supported by concrete evidence**. Opus Dei’s political stance is officially neutral; as the organization often reiterates, *“Opus Dei has no political agenda; members are free in politics”*. And indeed, there have been Opus Dei members on different sides (some even mildly socialist). However, this formal neutrality does not negate the clear pattern that **Opus Dei members overwhelmingly gravitated toward conservative, anti-communist regimes and causes**. The Spanish example shows both faces: while most Opus leaders loyally served Franco, one prominent member (Calvo Serer) opposed him and was punished. The claim that “Opus Dei ran Pinochet’s Chile” remains unproven – Opus Dei’s own inquiry found *“no member of Opus Dei was ever a member of Pinochet’s cabinets”*. This denial may be narrowly true (perhaps none had formally taken the spiritual oath at the time of serving, or they were close collaborators but not signed members). Yet investigative journalists and scholars of Chile note that *many in Pinochet’s inner circle were products of Opus Dei’s educational or spiritual programs*, if not card-carrying members. So the influence was real, even if direct control is overstated. Another myth is that Opus Dei was **synonymous with fascism**. While individual members had dubious sympathies (e.g. some early members expressed pro-Nazi or Vichy-friendly views in the 1940s), Opus Dei as a whole was more opportunistic – partnering with authoritarians like Franco out of anti-communist expediency, not necessarily out of fascist ideology. In fact, Escrivá positioned Opus Dei as distinct from the Falange (Spanish fascist party) and focused on long-term influence via holiness in professional life rather than party politics. Postwar, Opus Dei distanced itself from overt fascist nostalgia and instead embraced **neo-liberal economics and anti-Marxist propaganda** as the path to Christianize society. Therefore, while the **“Nazi/Opus Dei conspiracy”** trope is exaggerated, the kernel of truth is Opus Dei eagerly participated in U.S.-led Cold War structures (like the CIA-Vatican “ratlines” that aided some anti-Soviet fascist exiles in Latin America, or the WACL anti-communist network in which figures like Chile’s Opus-aligned Jaime Guzmán interfaced). In conclusion, Opus Dei exemplified how a religious organization could pursue its spiritual aims (spreading a conservative Catholic worldview) by aligning with temporal powers. In the Cold War, that meant **reinforcing authoritarian and capitalist forces against leftist revolution**, often in tandem with U.S. foreign policy – a convergence of cross and flag that significantly shaped outcomes in Spain, Latin America, and beyond.

## Conclusion

From the 1940s through 1970, American Christianity – broadly defined to include U.S. Protestant initiatives and transnational Catholic movements – underwent a transformation into a **concerted political instrument of the Cold War**. This chapter examined the Unification Church, The Family, and Opus Dei as case studies. Despite their differing theologies and contexts, common themes emerge:

* **Ideological Convergence with U.S. Policy:** All three movements cast themselves in militant opposition to communism, framing the Cold War as a spiritual battle between God-fearing “freedom” and godless totalitarianism. This provided moral fervor to U.S. anti-communist efforts: Rev. Moon preached communism as Satan’s tool; The Family taught that God chose capitalist leaders to vanquish socialism; Opus Dei fought atheistic Marxism as the Church’s foremost foe. In doing so, each attracted support and/or funding from American and allied governments.

* **Transnational Operations and Networks:** These groups all transcended borders. Moon’s church, born in Korea, built a presence across Asia, the Americas, and Europe – even engaging in paramilitary logistics in Central America. The Family quietly set up prayer cells from Washington to African capitals to Asian palaces, linking elites in an informal alliance. Opus Dei expanded from Spain into a global Catholic network, placing members in universities, parliaments, and economies worldwide. Each became a **conveyor belt moving money, influence, and information across nations** – often parallel to or intertwined with CIA and State Department channels.

* **Geopolitical Influence and Proxy Activity:** Far from mere faith communities, these groups executed **political missions on behalf of or in concert with governments**. The Unification Church effectively acted as an unofficial arm of the South Korean (and at times U.S.) government – conducting influence operations (like the pro-Nixon campaign) and propaganda through media like *The Washington Times*. The Fellowship Foundation served as a backdoor conduit connecting U.S. officials to foreign leaders outside normal diplomacy, often smoothing cooperation with anti-communist strongmen (Somalia, Indonesia, various Latin American juntas). Opus Dei members and sympathizers took up key roles in regimes aligned with the U.S. – from Franco’s Spain (a NATO ally in all but name) to Pinochet’s Chile (a bulwark against Marxism in South America). In these ways, religion was *weaponized* as an instrument of soft power or even hard power (when Moon’s group supplied materiel to Contra rebels, for example). The synergy was often deliberate: U.S. Cold War strategists recognized that **harnessing religious networks could achieve what overt policy might not** – from legitimizing allies to undermining communist appeal among populations.

* **Elite Coordination and “Infiltration”:** Each movement specialized in influencing societal elites (“top-down” strategy). Vereide’s Family explicitly targeted politicians and businessmen to effect a Christian **“trickle-down” influence** on society. Opus Dei similarly sought to *“win converts who have talents for politics \[to] serve in government positions,”* in line with Catholic social doctrine. Even Moon’s church, though it engaged in mass recruiting, placed special emphasis on currying favor with presidents, congressmen, and cultural leaders in various countries. This elite focus sometimes provoked backlash – critics accused these groups of being “shadowy cabals.” We found that while outright conspiracy theories are exaggerated, it is true that **unaccountable, secretive cliques wielded real sway**: e.g. the Family’s closed-door prayer cells through which senators struck up global relationships, or Opus Dei’s hidden membership in cabinets and its influence in the Vatican’s corridors of power. These **closed networks blurred church and state, faith and espionage**, in ways that liberal democracies found hard to monitor.

In verifying the above, we relied on a range of sources: U.S. congressional reports, declassified CIA documents, reputable journalism, and scholarly works. The evidence strongly **confirms most key claims** about these groups’ Cold War roles – though it also nuances them. For instance, the Unification Church’s link to the KCIA, long rumored, is affirmed by CIA reports and the U.S. Congress. The Family’s brokering of U.S.-dictator friendships, once speculative, is now documented in archives (e.g. the Somali aid story). Opus Dei’s involvement with Franco and other regimes is factual, though the extent of its direct political control is often exaggerated. Where popular claims lacked evidence, we noted it – for example, no proof that Opus Dei members *officially* sat in Pinochet’s cabinet (despite many being influential around it).

By 1970, the pattern was clear: **American-led anti-communism had an overt military/economic front – and a covert religious front.** In the cultural and ideological arena of the Cold War, these religious organizations were the shock troops, undermining communist appeal by offering transcendent justification for American values and forging an international Christian solidarity against the Red menace. This entanglement of religion and statecraft during 1945–1970 left a lasting legacy. It set the stage for the rise of the Religious Right in the 1980s (to which Moon’s and Coe’s networks directly contributed) and influenced the Vatican’s stance in the final showdown with Soviet communism (John Paul II’s alliance with Reagan owed something to Opus Dei’s groundwork). In sum, the transformation of segments of American Christianity into political instruments was not a conspiracy theory but a historical reality – one documented in the prayers, policies, and proxy battles of the Cold War.
