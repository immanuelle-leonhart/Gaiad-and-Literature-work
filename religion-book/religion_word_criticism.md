# Religion word criticism

The word religion is one that has many different uses and not all uses are ones I equally object to


According to wiktionary there are five definitions[^cite_1](^cite_1)

1. (*uncountable*) Belief in a spiritual or metaphysical reality (often including at least one deity), accompanied by practices or rituals pertaining to the belief. 
1. (*countable*) A particular system of such belief, and the rituals and practices proper to it. 
1. (*uncountable*) The way of life committed to by monks and nuns.
1. (*uncountable, informal*) Rituals and actions associated with religious beliefs, but considered apart from them. 
1. (*countable*) Any practice to which someone or some group is seriously devoted.


Numbers 1 and 2 are the most common ones and the ones I will want to critique.
