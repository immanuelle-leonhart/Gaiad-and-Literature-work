## Protestant Reformation and the Turn from Ritual to Belief
Introduction. The Protestant Reformation did not merely reinterpret Christian doctrine; it recast the very structure of religious life in early modern Europe. In predominantly Catholic medieval Europe, "embodied" religion centered on communal ritual, sacramental symbols, and mythic cosmologies (the saints, the Mass as sacrifice, pilgrimages, indulgences, etc.). Protestantism, by contrast, prized inner faith and Scripture, subordinating outward ceremony to personal conviction and doctrine. This shift can be seen as a flattening of the old mythic order into a self-enclosed, rationalized belief system. We analyze this transformation through a post-structuralist lens (especially Foucault's concept of discipline and power) while drawing on sociology (Weber's Protestant Ethic), intellectual history (Taylor on secular experience), and political economy (the reallocation of church wealth). Each section addresses one facet of the Reformation's restructuring of religion.

### Economic Entanglements: Reformation and Early Capitalism
The Reformation emerged amid the breakdown of feudal order and the rise of commercial capitalism. As Cantoni et al. demonstrate, massive resources (land, wealth, human capital) shifted from ecclesiastical to secular hands. Closed monasteries and confiscated church lands funded palaces, roads, and civic institutions in Protestant territories[^cite_1](^cite_1). Cantoni, Dittmar, and Yuchtman (2017) find that "secular authorities acquired enormous amounts of wealth from monasteries closed during the Reformation," and that Protestant regions saw new investment in non-religious buildings (palaces, town halls)[^cite_2](^cite_2)[^cite_3](^cite_3). This "reallocation" of resources powered emerging bourgeois classes and civil bureaucracy (many graduates of Protestant universities went into public service[^cite_4](^cite_4)). In short, Protestant reform created an economic base for capitalist society by diverting church rent-seeking into profit-seeking and state formation[^cite_5](^cite_5)[^cite_6](^cite_6).

Max Weber's classic analysis similarly links Protestant doctrine to capitalist subjectivity. Weber noted that inner-worldly asceticism – the "calling" or Beruf – was given a religious stamp by Luther and especially Calvin[^cite_7](^cite_7)[^cite_8](^cite_8). Luther proclaimed in On Christian Liberty (1520) that "A Christian man is the most free lord of all, and subject to none; [yet](yet) a Christian man is the most dutiful servant of all, and subject to every one"[^cite_9](^cite_9). This paradoxical doctrine of inner freedom under God laid the groundwork for a self-disciplined individual. Calvin in Geneva demanded a "monastic discipline for everyone," harnessing civic life to a rigorous piety[^cite_10](^cite_10). Weber argued that these Protestant innovations in conscience and labor discipline fostered "the spirit of capitalism": hard work and reinvestment became seen as moral duties[^cite_11](^cite_11)[^cite_12](^cite_12). In Weber's words, Calvinism created "the most absolutely unbearable form of ecclesiastical control of the individual"[^cite_13](^cite_13) – a control that paradoxically channelled people's energies into industrious worldly activity. Thus the Reformation's spirituality – sola fide, calling, worldly asceticism – intertwined with and advanced the rise of bourgeois wealth and individualist subjectivity[^cite_14](^cite_14)[^cite_15](^cite_15).

Moreover, Protestant political theory often justified the sovereign taking the place of the church. In the Holy Roman Empire, cuius regio, eius religio (1555) allowed princes to seize former Catholic lands and impose state churches. Cantoni et al. note that this secularizing impulse was unintended but profound: Protestant "entry" was facilitated by emergent market societies willing to bear wealth into new "utility-maximizing" (in their terminology) contractual relations[^cite_16](^cite_16)[^cite_17](^cite_17). In plain terms, where commerce thrived and the landed order weakened, both peasants and patricians found Lutheranism attractive – partly because it freed them from clerical tithes and obligations[^cite_18](^cite_18)[^cite_19](^cite_19). By contrast, in stagnant feudal regions with strong nobility, the medieval Church could sustain its monopoly via patronage. Thus the Reformation both reflected and accelerated class realignments: it fostered bourgeois subjectivities of independent selfhood and profit-oriented discipline at the expense of feudal communalism[^cite_20](^cite_20)[^cite_21](^cite_21).

### Iconoclasm and Ritual Decoding
Protestant reformers launched an explicit attack on Catholic ritual and imagery. Initially, this took the form of iconoclasm: the mass destruction of statues, altars, and stained glass in many German, Swiss, and Dutch cities. Luther himself tolerated some images, but Zwingli and Calvin often proclaimed them "idols," to be purged. As one recent study notes, modern aesthetic theories of image and art were shaped by the Reformation's iconophobia. Protestants and Counter-Reformation Catholics together "exhib[ited](ited) iconophilic and iconophobic aspects," and Protestant iconoclasm in the 1520s "had a strong influence" on later European views of imagesdiva-portal.org[^cite_22](^cite_22). In practice this meant that mythic symbolism was stripped bare. Where medieval churchgoers learned theology through ritual drama and icon, Protestant worship became "instructive": centered on preaching and singing, in the vernacular, with an emphasis on plain clarity[^cite_23](^cite_23)[^cite_24](^cite_24). As a Catholic commentator observes, Protestant liturgy "emphasizes clarity and simplicity over mystery and complex ritual" – congregants now saw sermons rather than a sacred sacrifice, and ministers faced the people rather than leading esoteric rites[^cite_25](^cite_25).

This was more than aesthetic: the underlying theology reinterpreted every sacramental and seasonal symbol. The Mass ceased to be viewed as a mystical reenactment of Calvary; instead it became a commemorative Lord's Supper. Zwingli famously argued that Christ's presence in Communion is spiritual, not corporeal – a "memorial" meal for the faithful, not a magical transformation of bread. Luther retained a real presence but rescinded the Catholic notion of transubstantiation; Calvin spoke of a "mystical presence" but likewise rejected a physical sacrifice[^cite_26](^cite_26). In effect, ritual time was flattened into Scripture: saints' days and feast-days were often abandoned (except, say, Christmas and Easter) in favor of the Sunday sermon. Liturgical calendar and sacramental seasons gave way to the printed Bible read on a weekly cycle.

From a post-structuralist view, this was a "decoding" of mythic signs into propositional content. Jean-Luc Nancy points out that monotheism has always "withdrawn any myth or meaning from the world," positing a God removed from history[^cite_27](^cite_27). Protestantism extended this logic: the divine was accessible only in the unmediated Word. As Nancy writes, modernity's drive toward demythologization – stripping narrative out of social life "in the name of … reason [or](or) progress" – actually stems from this "atheistic logic of monotheism"[^cite_28](^cite_28). In other words, Protestantism's assault on religious symbol was not against superstition alone but part of a deeper secularizing trajectory. Iconoclasm "dismantled" the old cosmos of signs so thoroughly that believers could only narrate history (biblical or moral) rather than feel mythic presence.

### From Utopia to Discipline: Radical Sectarianism and Control
The Reformation unleashed utopian fervors, yet the Protestant mainstream quickly reined them in through political alliance and social discipline. Radical sects (Anabaptists, Munsterites, Familists, Spiritualists, etc.) envisioned Christian communities based on shared goods, visions of imminent apocalypse, and direct revelation. These were utopian projects – calls to remake society along egalitarian or mystical lines. For example, Münster (1534–35) briefly became an Anabaptist "New Jerusalem," complete with communal property and polygamy under self-styled "King David" Jan van Leyden[^cite_29](^cite_29)[^cite_30](^cite_30). One historian notes that Münster "became the refuge of all persecuted, desperate people and the 'New Jerusalem' of radical Anabaptism," drawing oppressed believers across Europe[^cite_31](^cite_31). The city was besieged by the bishop's troops and retaken amid horrific carnage. With Münster's fall, authorities in Protestant cities grew determined to suppress any communal experiment that threatened order.

Why this turn from utopia to discipline? Partly because secular rulers (both Protestant princes and Catholic emperors) saw the economic and political threat these sects posed. Elders who repudiated private property or refused to swear loyalty to princes challenged the emerging territorial states. Thus Anabaptists were soon banned by both Protestant and Catholic magistrates; Münster's leaders were tortured and executed as a warning. The mainstream reformers (Lutherans, Reformed) largely disavowed the radicals. Luther condemned peasant revolts (1525) on theological grounds, urging princes to "slay even his father and mother" if they rebelled against order (a brutal stance to preserve peace). The Reformed in Zurich executed Anabaptists as heretics (e.g. Michael Sattler in 1527). In England and Scandinavia, even moderate Protestants under monarchy outlawed sects that undermined royal control of the church.

This "re-disciplining" of utopian excess can be read through Foucault's lens of power and subjectivation. Lindholm and Di Carlo (2024) argue that early Lutheranism already displayed disciplinary power: church services functioned like classrooms, training obedient subjects. In a famous Wittenberg altarpiece (by Cranach), Luther preaches from a pulpit to rapt congregants – a tableau much like Foucault's classroom illustration of surveillance and normalization. Here the minister is the teacher; the congregation is the disciplined class learning not Latin prayers but a doctrine. Foucault's concept of anatomo-politics applies: the Reformation increasingly positioned each soul under watchful guidance of preaching, catechism, and moral "calling." By the mid-1500s, Protestant pastors and consistories oversaw schooling, poor relief, and even punishments for sins like adultery or Sabbath-breaking. Paradoxically, Protestants who celebrated individual faith also created tighter social regimentation – what Weber and others called "the iron cage" of discipline – to prevent heterodox alternatives[^cite_32](^cite_32).

Thus, liberal utopian energies were turned inward or bureaucratized. Public ecstatic prophecy gave way to private moral introspection. Where radicals preached overthrow of old orders, established Protestants preached obedience to magistrates (as a divine ordinance). Economic self-help replaced communal sharing (apart from groups like the Hutterites, who were also soon hunted). In short, utopian fervor was domesticated: Protestant regimes curbed "excess" liberty by binding believers into state churches and market roles – a process very much in keeping with Foucault's genealogy of modern discipline.

### Sacramental Collapse: Demystifying the Cosmos
Central to Catholic Christianity was a sacramental worldview: God's grace was mediated through visible rites and sacred objects. Transubstantiation, baptismal regeneration, confession, ordination, relics, and indulgences made the divine tangible. Protestantism, however, systematically collapsed this sacramental universe into scripture and conscience. Catholic salvation was communal and mystical; Protestant salvation was individual and textual. As Weber observed, the Lutheran Reformation "completely eliminated salvation through Church and sacraments," redefining faith as a personal relation with Christ[^cite_33](^cite_33).

What was lost or transformed? The Catholic cosmos – a vertical ordering of Heaven, Earth, and the underworld – was flattened. Purgatory vanished (Protestants abolished indulgences and the treasury of merit), so the uncertainty of souls after death was replaced by assurance of personal salvation or damnation. The Mass was no longer seen as a propitiatory sacrifice transcending time; it became a "supper" of remembrance. Calvin even likened the Lord's Supper to the daily bread we eat – a simple, earthly sign of Christ's hidden presence. Some Protestants went further: Zwingli and the radical Anabaptists denied any real presence, treating Communion purely as a communal prayer. Thus "mystery" was deflated: nothing in the elements itself was magically efficacious, only faith made them meaningful.

On the one hand, this might look like demystification. Protestant theology insisted on rational grounds: sacraments work when attended by true faith, not by any mystical power in the rite itself. Baptism, for example, was redefined as a sign of a covenant already bestowed by God, not as a merit-conferring act. In Protestant confessions, clergy are sharply demoted: there is no sacramental priesthood interposing between believer and God. Even Mary and the saints were largely excised from public worship (no more Corpus Christi or All Saints parades). What Foucault calls the "pastoral" function moved from confession to sermon and from the confessional stall to the bedroom: each believer's conscience became the locus of spiritual accountability.

On the other hand, Protestants redirected what had been "sacred power" into the Bible and the church as institution. With papal authority gone, scripture (and its interpretation by magisterial churches) became the ultimate arbiter of truth. One might say the church became its own miracle: words on a page, universally accessible, now held a quasi-cosmic primacy. Rather than relics or icons, Protestants prized the printed Word. Calvin's Geneva even instituted a sort of "church discipline" with courts enforcing Sunday worship and Biblical ethics – a new metaphysical order built on biblical time. In effect, sacraments were replaced by proclamation. Saving grace did not cease to exist; it was reimagined as fully present in the Word made flesh, accessible to all believers in community. This reconfiguration signaled a redirection of spiritual power: from altars to pulpits, from ritual mystery to doctrinal certainty.

Talal Asad's critique is instructive here: he argues that modern "religion" is constructed as a system of belief separated from everyday life and politics. The Reformation laid the groundwork for this by tying salvation to assent to creedal propositions (e.g. justification by faith) rather than to participation in the medieval cultic order. In other words, Protestantism helped produce the idea that religion is essentially belief and conscience, not ritual practice. The Catholic sacramental universe, in which the spiritual was deeply woven into the fabric of communal life, largely collapsed into a more privatized inner piety.

### Myth, Belief, Organization, Ritual: A Comparative Framework
We may schematize the Reformation's effect on the four dimensions of religion: myth (sacred narrative), belief (doctrinal content), organization (institutional structure), and ritual (symbolic practice).<ul class="c14 lst-kix_3rqluxr8qhwv-0 start"><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Myth. Catholicism was rich in mythic narrative: creation stories, the lives of saints, martyr legends, the cosmic drama of Christ's death and sacrifice as "salvation history." Protestants did not invent new myths, but they recast or expelled the old ones. Biblical stories (e.g. the Exodus, Acts of the Apostles) were often read literally as "holy history" rather than allegory, but their interpretation became secularized (moral exemplars rather than mystical truths). Medieval myths like the intercession of saints, the cult of relics, or folk traditions (sprites, witches) were officially denounced as superstition. Nietzschean terms might say the Reformation "killed the Father" of myth, claiming progress required discarding the "spontaneous religion" of the people. Jean-Luc Nancy would note that this fits a monotheistic legacy: monotheism demythologizes. As Nancy puts it, the Christian God "atheizes himself" by withdrawing from worldly story, ultimately signalling a world "without God"[^cite_34](^cite_34). Thus Protestantism pressed myth out of the church into individualized belief or history.<br>
</li><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Belief. Belief (doctrine) rose in prominence. The Reformers championed sola scriptura (Scripture alone) and sola fide (faith alone) – explicit propositional tenets about grace, election, and sacraments. Catechisms, confessions of faith, and theological debates proliferated. Intangible belief became the litmus of religious identity. Each Protestant denomination codified its creed (Lutherans, Calvinists, Anglicans, etc.), so that organized belief now defined community. Ironically, this doctrinal focus was the new mythic core for believers: the myths had gone, but a rational narrative (from the Fall to the Last Judgment) took their place as a "cognitive frame." Protestant preaching internalized biblical narrative into ethics (for example, Old Testament law became a moral story instead of a cosmic law imposed by a vicarious priesthood). The believer's experience became "inner" and belief-centered, satisfying Foucault's notion of the confessional – one now confessed faith and personal interpretation instead of penitent feeling. Rousseau and later secular thinkers would build on this, conceiving religion as "voluntary" creed anchored in conscience.<br>
</li><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Organization. Institutionally, Protestantism fragmented the monolithic medieval Church into many churches. Each prince or city could set up its own church (often with a state-appointed bishop or consistory). The pre-Reformation Church's universal hierarchy was replaced by national or local structures. In some cases (England, Scandinavia), monarchs became heads of church. In others (Geneva, some German cities), civic councils or synods ruled. Layered beneath these were further splits into sects and free churches (Anabaptists, Baptists, etc.) that often rejected state ties. Weber noted that Protestantism spawned a sect–church cycle: sects (voluntary, schismatic groups with strict disciplines) and churches (state churches with formal membership) alternated, institutionalizing diversity. By contrast, medieval religion had been more geographically uniform, tied to local parishes but conceptually universal. In effect, Protestantism exported the logic of institutional organization to the modern world: religion became one sphere of life with its own bureaucracies, comparable to the new secular state. This was a key step toward the modern category "organized religion" – discrete societies governed by creeds and offices, distinct from (though often allied with) political power.<br>
</li><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Ritual. Protestant reformers drastically curtailed ritual. The medieval Mass, Marian devotions, fasts, pilgrimages, etc., were abolished or simplified. Only two sacraments remained (Baptism and the Lord's Supper), and these were stripped of Catholic magic. Ordinary believers now needed only a Bible and prayer, rather than rosaries or candles. Eucharistic ritual became brief and vernacular, preceded by sermons. As noted above, liturgy shifted toward "clarity" and community, suppressing mystery[^cite_35](^cite_35). In sum, ritual and mythic performance lost their former centrality. Protestants did not "expel" myth entirely (they still told Bible stories and sang psalms), but they relocated much that was once symbol into moral narrative and ethical life. Community solidarity relied more on schools, guilds, or nationhood than on religious fairs or processions. Sacramental grace, once a cosmic force, became an inner assurance.<br>
</li></ul>Altogether, Protestantism can be seen as favoring belief and organization over ritual and myth. It replaced a communal, embodied religion with a more disembodied, textually-grounded one. One might say it tried to secularize myth by making it historical (literal Bible accounts) or ethical (the world as stage for God's moral teaching), rather than leaving it as immanent sacral saga. Nancy's insight about capitalism is relevant: he contends that both monotheism and capitalism "strip" social life of narratives and values[^cite_36](^cite_36). Protestantism's rational morality and market-friendly individualism anticipated that process, leaving religion itself as one value-sphere (of belief) among others.

### Long-Term Effects: Privatized Belief and the Making of Secular Religion
The structural shift initiated by Protestant reform paved the way for the modern concept of religion as chiefly private belief. In the Protestant mold, religion became what one believes – doctrines on paper – rather than what one does in ritual. This idea underlies our contemporary categories: "organized religion," "belief system," "secular faith." As one recent scholar notes, the very notions of "religion" and "secularity" in today's liberal West are modeled on Enlightenment Protestant assumptions[^cite_37](^cite_37). He writes: "When the modern concept of religion took shape, it was in the context of Enlightenment Protestantism, which became the model for religion as such."[^cite_38](^cite_38). In other words, to be "religious" came to mean having interior convictions and private conscience – exactly the Reformation's emphasis.

This shift had key implications:<ul class="c14 lst-kix_flcpi6oo5tre-0 start"><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Privatization of Belief. Protestant theology broke religion into personal faith. Each individual was encouraged to read the Bible and judge doctrine by conscience. The idea of a secular state could rest on the notion that religion is an optional, individual loyalty (as Jefferson and Madison later argued), not a corporate obligation. Indeed, the language of "religious liberty" – freedom of opinion in matters of faith – assumes religion is about inner assent. Talal Asad and others observe that modern human rights discourse redefines religion as "creedal" and "deeply held belief." This could hardly have emerged without Protestant influence; Catholics and Orthodox long defined religion in communal, sacramental terms (e.g. participation in the church, not mere belief).<br>
</li><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Separation of Church and State. Confessional Europe in 1650 was still a world of established churches. But the Reformation's legacy is a slow shift toward disestablishment. The wars of religion taught that enforcing uniform ritual breeds unrest; thinkers like Locke (a Puritan) argued for toleration precisely because faith was seen as inward. By the 19th century, many states claimed neutrality toward church beliefs, creating a public/private divide. This "secular" political order assumes religion is just one sector. It was imaginable because reformers had first relegated rites to the domestic sphere and invoked an autonomous conscience.<br>
</li><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Organized Religion as Category. The pluralism of Protestant sects itself established the norm of "organized religion" versus beliefs. Scholars of religion note that Protestant denominationalism provided the template for later religious identity groups everywhere. Even today, when sociologists study Buddhism or Islam, they often implicitly assume "believers" whose lives revolve around theology and moral commitments, a model inherited from Christianity. Nancy's and Taylor's work both remind us that our conceptual universe (religion, secularity, belief) emerged from a distinctly Western, Protestant-infused history[^cite_39](^cite_39)[^cite_40](^cite_40).<br>
</li><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Secular Categories. Finally, Protestant reforms seeded secular ideas. By exiling myth and ritual from public life, Protestant culture helped carve out a separate realm for "the world." Capital accumulation and statecraft (themselves fostered by Protestant ethics) became "secular" pursuits, distinct from "religious" redemption. Foucault's notion of governmentality – power over life – finds an ironic foreshadowing in the Reformation: Luther's teaching that princes govern God's people, and Calvin's theocratic city planning, were early forms of managing populations. The long-term result is a worldview where belief systems (like Christianity) coexist with other ideologies, none absolute.<br>
</li></ul>In sum, the Protestant Reformation initiated a genealogy of modern religion. By substituting inward faith for outward magic, and doctrine for sacrament, it laid the groundwork for the very idea of religion as we know it today – a private belief system organized into churches, separate from the secular state and stripped of the mythic depth that once animated medieval life[^cite_41](^cite_41)[^cite_42](^cite_42).

Together, these sources substantiate how Protestantism restructured Western religiosity – a shift from communal mythic ritual to individualized belief and doctrinal order.

#### 1&#8239;&#8239;Redefining "faith" as an inner state
<p class="c0">Medieval Christianity had understood fides as an embodied habitus—a virtue formed by charity (fides formata caritate) and enacted through sacrament and community.&#8239;Aquinas: "faith is formed by charity; charity makes faith perfect."</p><p class="c0">Early reformers reversed the vector.</p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_e5l8xxwnuuh3-0 start"><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Martin&#8239;Luther called faith "a living, daring confidence in God's grace, so sure and certain that a man could stake his life on it a thousand times."<br> The "confidence" happens in the conscience; ritual can only preach or symbolize it.<br></li><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">John&#8239;Calvin tightened the definition: "Faith is a firm and certain knowledge of God's favor toward us, founded upon the truth of the freely given promise in Christ."<br></li></ul><p class="c0">In both cases, knowledge-of-grace displaces participation-in-grace. Where Aquinas located faith in a sacramental ecology, Luther and Calvin locate it inside the judging subject—a decisive step toward the buffered self that Charles&#8239;Taylor sees as the hallmark of secularity .</p><hr><p class="c0 c10"></p>

#### 2&#8239;&#8239;Sola&#8239;fide and the birth of Protestant anxiety
<p class="c0">Because salvation now rests on an invisible disposition, believers had to audit their own interior. Luther's vocabulary of Anfechtung (assaults of doubt) captures the mood: the Word "teaches you … to experience how right, how true, how sweet … God's Word is" only through struggle and anxiety .</p><p class="c0">By the 17th&#8239;c. Puritans were urged to keep spiritual "registers"—journals in which daily feelings were interrogated for evidence of grace:</p><p class="c0 c26">"Self-examination is the setting up a court in conscience and keeping a register there, that by strict scrutiny a man may know how things stand between God and his own soul." (Thomas&#8239;Watson)</p><p class="c0">The result, as historian Stannard notes, was an "intense and unremitting fear of death" produced by God's inscrutable choice .</p><hr><p class="c0 c10"></p>

#### 3&#8239;&#8239;Predestination and the double bind
<p class="c0">Calvinist predestination intensified the loop: inward assurance is both sign of election and something no act of will can secure. Diaries, sermons, and tracts therefore teach believers to read every tremor of the heart as possible evidence—while warning that self-deception is omnipresent. John&#8239;Bunyan's Grace Abounding swings between terror and relief, memorializing each doubt so that it can serve as later proof of deliverance.</p><p class="c0">The Calvinist must therefore believe sincerely and perform belief strategically—a proto-modern doublethink in which the self polices itself for the right affect.</p><hr><p class="c0 c10"></p>

#### 4&#8239;&#8239;From confessional interior to self-surveillance
<p class="c0">Michel&#8239;Foucault supplies the genealogy:</p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_4zm5unro13x-0 start"><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">"He who is subjected to a field of visibility … inscribes in himself the power relation … he becomes the principle of his own subjection."<br></li></ul><p class="c0">The Protestant sermon replaces the Catholic confessional booth; but the logic is identical: the believer internalizes the gaze and turns it on the self continuously. Louis&#8239;Althusser's axiom—"there is no ideology except by the subject and for the subject" —describes precisely this transition: faith becomes an ideological interpellation that calls "You!" and is answered in an inward voice.</p><hr><p class="c0 c10"></p>

#### 5&#8239;&#8239;Catholic & Orthodox alternatives: faith as communion
<p class="c0">Catholic theology keeps faith entwined with sacrament: it is perfected by charity (habitus) and enacted corporeally in Eucharist, pilgrimage, penance. Eastern Orthodoxy radicalizes this relational ontology.&#8239;John&#8239;Zizioulas:</p><p class="c0 c26">"All communion must involve otherness as a primary and constitutive ingredient … freedom is part of the notion of being."</p><p class="c0">Here faith = shared liturgy, not private certitude. The ecclesial body, not the introspective conscience, mediates salvation—short-circuiting the solitary anxiety that haunted Protestants.</p><hr><p class="c0 c10"></p>

#### 8&#8239;&#8239;Conclusion
<p class="c0">The Reformation's redefinition of faith—from sacramental habitus to psychological state—generated a new form of self-relating subjectivity. Its legacy runs from Puritan diaries to the modern "entrepreneur of the self." Understanding this arc is crucial for any critique of contemporary religiosity (including neo-pagan revivals): the field in which new myths are planted has already been ploughed by Protestant interiorization, anxiety, and the ideological demand to mean what we perform while performing what we must mean.</p><p class="c0">(For fuller development see Weber 1905; Foucault 1979; Taylor 2007; Asad 1993; Cavanaugh 2008.)</p><p class="c0 c10"></p><p class="c0">Evangelicalism as Late-Capitalist Reterritorialization<br> (A Marxist–Deleuzian reading of how U&#8239;S-style evangelicalism stabilizes the neoliberal order while masking its own contradictions)</p><hr>

### Deleuze stuff


#### 1&#8239;&#8239;From "decoding" to brute domination
<p class="c0">Deleuze &&#8239;Guattari describe capitalism as the first social machine that "constitutes itself on the failure of all pre-existent codes," liberating every flow only to recapture it in new axioms of control[^cite_159](^cite_159)[^cite_56](^cite_56). Mainline Protestantism carried out an early wave of this decoding—dissolving Catholic liturgies into interior belief (your previous chapter). Contemporary U&#8239;S. evangelicalism represents the next stage: having eaten away even its own Reformation foundations (confession, creeds, catechesis), it re-imposes simplified commands—"believe, submit, consume"—as what Deleuze calls pure domination, a yassified tradition that survives precisely because of its austerity.</p><p class="c0 c26">"Christianity taught us to see the eye of the lord looking down upon us… Their function is to tame, and the result is the fabrication of docile and obedient subjects." —Anti-Oedipus[^cite_160](^cite_160)[^cite_57](^cite_57)</p><hr><p class="c2"></p>

#### 2&#8239;&#8239;The prosperity gospel & spiritualized neoliberalism
<p class="c0">Kathryn&#8239;Lofton argues that Oprah Winfrey's media empire is "religion for an age in which markets make custom, consumption is the universal aspect, and celebrities are ostensible gods."[^cite_161](^cite_161)[^cite_58](^cite_58) Prosperity-gospel megachurches extend this "spiritual capitalism" to the working poor: salvation is re-coded as personal brand management ("live your best life now"), while structural exploitation is renamed blessing. The result meshes smoothly with neoliberal responsibilization: if you're broke, tithe harder. An African megachurch study finds worship music itself operates as a "neoliberal apparatus" that trains believers to oscillate between prayer and product[^cite_162](^cite_162)[^cite_59](^cite_59).</p><hr><p class="c2"></p>

#### 3&#8239;&#8239;Contemporary worship as commodity-capture
<p class="c0">A 2022 study shows five megachurch labels—Hillsong, Bethel, Elevation, Passion, Maverick City—now dominate the worship charts, creating a closed market for affective religious goods[^cite_163](^cite_163)[^cite_60](^cite_60). Hillsong's own researchers call this the evolution from congregation to global brand[^cite_164](^cite_164)[^cite_61](^cite_61). The music's four-chord anthems supply what Marx called commodity fetishism: believers consume the sound of transcendence while remaining tied to screens, smoke machines, and point-of-sale tithing apps. Thus evangelicalism does not merely bless capitalism; it functions as capitalism's liturgy.</p><hr><p class="c2"></p>

#### 4&#8239;&#8239;Patriarchy as last-ditch reterritorialization
<p class="c0">Kristin&#8239;Kobes&#8239;Du&#8239;Mez shows how white evangelical culture "glorifies the aggressive, patriarchal idea of manhood" in order to stabilize the movement after the feminist and civil-rights upheavals of the 1960s[^cite_165](^cite_165)[^cite_62](^cite_62). Purity-culture literature channels that patriarchy into biopolitical surveillance of girls' bodies:</p><p class="c0 c26">"At the core of purity culture is patriarchy and the message that, compared to men, women don't matter all that much."[^cite_166](^cite_166)[^cite_63](^cite_63)</p><p class="c0">Such teaching no longer grants men genuine provider status (Fordist wages are gone) yet insists women "submit" so the nuclear family can still service consumer debt and unpaid care work. Marx would call this an ideological super-structure masking the unpaid reproductive labor that capitalism requires.</p><hr><p class="c2"></p>

#### 5&#8239;&#8239;Homophobia, transphobia, and the policing of decoded subjects
<p class="c0">Sexual minorities expose the bare fact that contemporary worship has no thick theology of embodiment—only slogans about "male headship." Hence queer existence is experienced by the movement as a threat to its already thinned code. Anthea&#8239;Butler bluntly notes that racism sits "at the core of conservative evangelical activism and power"[^cite_167](^cite_167)[^cite_64](^cite_64); the same holds for heteronormativity. Both function as boundary-drawing devices that harden group identity even as economic policies (gig work, medical debt) erode everyday stability.</p><hr><p class="c2"></p>

#### 6&#8239;&#8239;Exceptions and counter-flows
<ul class="c14 lst-kix_s1h6y6a2jhoz-0 start"><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Black evangelicals. Black churches often carry evangelical theology but graft it onto liberationist praxis: James&#8239;Cone's dictum that God is "unreservedly identified with the oppressed" remains influential[^cite_168](^cite_168)[^cite_65](^cite_65). Economic-justice coalitions led by Black evangelicals show flashes of class consciousness even while retaining conservative sexual ethics.<br></li><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Midwestern cooperatives & "new evangelicals." Historians trace strands of populist anti-bank, pro-labor activism within small-town Midwestern churches, a reminder that evangelical forms can host divergent contents[^cite_169](^cite_169)[^cite_66](^cite_66). These counter-flows prove that the movement is not monolithic but rather a contested field of deterritorialized affects.<br></li></ul><hr><p class="c2"></p>

#### 7&#8239;&#8239;Comparative detour: "Islamic Calvinism" in Turkey
<p class="c0">A 2005 European Stability Initiative report coined "Islamic Calvinism" for Anatolian entrepreneurs who wed free-market discipline to Islamic piety; Turkish analysts show this fusion arose as neoliberal globalization incentivized "probusiness values" and used religion to neutralize the left[^cite_170](^cite_170)[^cite_67](^cite_67)[^cite_68](^cite_68). Saudi Wahhabism remains over-coded and petro-state funded; Erdo&#287;an-era Turkish Islam, by contrast, resembles U&#8239;S. evangelicalism's lean, motivational style, making it an ideal vector for capitalist modernization.</p><hr><p class="c2"></p>

#### 8&#8239;&#8239;The Cold-War genealogy: from segregation academies to global "special ops"
<p class="c0">The religious-right coalition that crystallized in the 1970s redirected segregationist anger into a pro-life crusade, providing an anti-communist moral front. Special-ops organizations amplify this project:</p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_hhn0wdw65736-0 start"><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Opus&#8239;Dei operated transnational anti-communist networks and helped spread neoliberal Catholic politics[^cite_171](^cite_171)[^cite_69](^cite_69).<br></li><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">The Unification Church funded the World League for Freedom and Democracy and other anti-Soviet projects, and still shifts its vast assets into U&#8239;S. lobbying[^cite_172](^cite_172)[^cite_70](^cite_70)[^cite_71](^cite_71).<br></li></ul><p class="c0">Both groups model how religious minimalism plus media spectacle can serve geopolitical capitalism beyond Protestant borders.</p><hr><p class="c2"></p>

#### 9&#8239;&#8239;Mechanisms of consent: self-surveillance and entrepreneurial piety
<p class="c0">Foucault's "technologies of the self" explain why the evangelical believer is an ideal neoliberal citizen: she audits her soul (quiet-time apps, accountability groups) the way a gig worker audits brand metrics[^cite_173](^cite_173)[^cite_72](^cite_72). A recent Kenyan essay observes that the state welcomes church evangelists because they "co-opt the proletariat who would object to neoliberal policies"[^cite_174](^cite_174)[^cite_73](^cite_73). In Althusser's terms, the worship set "interpellates" the subject—You there, lifting your hands, you are free!—while siphoning surplus value upward through offerings and media subscriptions.</p><hr><p class="c2"></p>

#### 10&#8239;&#8239;Conclusion: evangelicalism as reterritorialization of decoded flows
<p class="c0">Evangelicalism stabilizes late-capitalist crisis by simplifying belief, aesthetic, and social order to the bare minimum required for continued extraction. Its megachurch soundscape and purity rules are not nostalgic returns to tradition; they are the cheap plastic scaffolding erected after decades of neoliberal demolition. Yet counter-flows—from Black liberationist preaching to Anatolian businessmen re-imagining Islamic piety—show that decoded desire can still exceed the axioms. As Deleuze &&#8239;Guattari warn, the very flows that capitalism unleashes may ultimately "destroy the socius" it tries to save[^cite_175](^cite_175)[^cite_74](^cite_74). Whether evangelicalism mutates again or collapses under its own contradictions will shape the spiritual terrain in which new (neo-pagan?) imaginaries must operate.</p><p class="c2"></p>

### Evangelicalism and the Neoliberal Order
<p class="c0">Contemporary U.S. evangelicalism operates largely as a simplified faith culture shaped for mass consumption. Services resemble entertainment events – with stadium&#8208;style praise bands, multimedia lighting, and rapid-fire sermons – rather than centers of rigorous theology. Even sympathetic observers admit the shallowness of much evangelical content. As pastor Tim Challies criticizes, many churches "use clich&eacute;d words to worship a clich&eacute;d God" so that congregants experience nothing deeper than sentimentality[^cite_75](^cite_75). This aestheticized worship discourages critical thought: emotional resonance and personal "encounters with God" replace extended biblical exposition or dialectical teaching. In effect, worship becomes a vehicle for ideological conformity. By offering distraction and an upbeat narrative of personal success, the format deters believers from questioning the social order. In Marxist terms, religion is a narcotic for the masses – "the opium of the people" – consoling them under capitalist exploitation[^cite_76](^cite_76). Contemporary evangelicalism exemplifies this, favoring simple uplifting messages over intellectual depth, thus channeling anxieties away from systemic critique into private piety.</p>

### Patriarchy and the Neoliberal Family
<p class="c0">Evangelicalism continues to enforce strict gender hierarchies, buttressing the myth of the self-sufficient nuclear family even as its material basis erodes. Modern churches almost universally preach "biblical manhood" and female submission, reviving the patriarchal family of the 1950s. But with men's wages stagnant and dual-income households now the norm, this model is largely symbolic. Popular critics note that "complementarianism is patriarchy&#8239;– nothing more, nothing less," despite evangelical claims to mutual "complementarity"[^cite_77](^cite_77). In practice, women are often pressured into traditional roles and men into authoritarian "head of household" roles, even though economic reality forces both to work. This ideological insistence on male dominion (as 'God's design') and female deference stabilizes the neoliberal family ideal: the burden of care and responsibility falls on the private family so that the state may retreat. Maintaining these gender norms gives individuals a sense of order and purpose amid economic precarity. In sum, the family values promoted by evangelicals function as an ideological safeguard: they re-inscribe patriarchal authority on the cultural level precisely when genuine patriarchy (the breadwinning father) has been hollowed out by capitalism.</p>

### Emotion and the Decline of Doctrine: Evangelism as Late-Stage Domination
<p class="c0">In late-stage capitalism, evangelicalism has shifted from intellectual substance to affective spectacle – a transformation one can view through Deleuze's notion of "pure control." The old coded doctrines (e.g. Calvinist theology) are decoded away, leaving a raw flow of feeling and belief that can be modulate by church producers. Churches now operate like entrepreneurial enterprises: pastors market the faith, worship is carefully stage-managed, and success is measured by crowd size and social-media buzz. David Wells, a theologian, notes how market logic has invaded worship: "We have brought into the church the rhythms of buying and selling, of making a product appealing so that a potential buyer can be lured into a sale," and we turn "the atmosphere of worship into one of pleasant entertainment"[^cite_78](^cite_78). The gospel becomes a spiritual product packaged as feel-good therapy. For Deleuze, this is a hallmark of capitalist "societies of control" – people are not controlled by overt discipline but by modulating their desires and affects. Evangelical services, with their upbeat music and positive-affirmation slogans, exemplify this mode. Content-light preaching (e.g. prosperity promises or simplistic moral lists) substitutes for dense theology. Believers are thus subtly governed by emotion: they are led to love their situation in exchange for community and hope, rather than confronted with material injustice. This embodies a late-stage ideological domination, where control is exercised not by heavy-handed doctrine but by constant stimulation and distraction.</p>

### Homophobia, Transphobia, and the Politics of Identity
<p class="c0">Sexual and gender issues serve as cultural battlefields that "make the base" for evangelical political identity. With capitalist crisis undermining stable class identities, evangelicals increasingly fixate on policing sexuality as a source of order. Historian Randall Balmer explains that the Religious Right learned any issue tied to sexual morality would reliably mobilize its members: "any issue that had some sort of connection to sexuality or sexual behavior was going to work for them"[^cite_79](^cite_79). Evangelical leaders cycle through crusades against "sodomy," gay marriage, abortion, and now transgender rights, not simply out of doctrinal purity but to produce a cohesive "us vs. them" narrative. This culture war dynamic resonates with Marxist and Foucauldian ideas of scapegoating: as economic and social institutions destabilize, marginalized groups become convenient targets. One social theorist notes that in capitalist crises homophobia and transphobia are "weaponized to police populations around access to diminishing spoils or social surpluses"[^cite_80](^cite_80). In practice, enraging the faithful over "gender chaos" helps maintain an illusion of cosmic order: rigid male/female roles are presented as God's unshakeable design against a world of fluid identities. In the wake of Roe v. Wade's repeal, this trend accelerated: evangelicals, having won on abortion, have redoubled their campaign on LGBT issues to channel discontent. The preached threat of "men in women's bathrooms" or "groomers" functions to discipline congregants' anxieties and reinforce the old gender code, even as the real material basis for that code continues to vanish.</p>

### From Reformation to Megachurch: A Distorted Inheritance
<p class="c0">Modern evangelicalism would be unrecognizable to Luther or Calvin. The Reformers built denominations around doctrine, biblical exegesis, and a communal intellectual tradition. By contrast, today's megachurches emphasize inward experience over theological rigor, though they still demand inner belief. The only lasting legacy of Protestantism is the premium on personal faith ("believe and be saved"), yet this has been transmuted into a consumerized spirituality. David Wells argues that instead of confronting sin and society, the American church has largely become a "marketing strategy" for self-help[^cite_81](^cite_81). He insists that the true gospel "is not about self-therapy" but "a soul-shaking, costly, demanding reality"[^cite_82](^cite_82) – a witness scarcely found in much of today's ministry. Where Lutherans and Calvinists would debate the Eucharist or predestination, many evangelicals now simply feel goosebumps when the lights dim, then move on to the next upbeat song. In short, the complex Protestant intellectual heritage has been decoded into something like a feel-good club, re-territorialized on hope and belonging. Structurally, however, evangelicals still demand loyalty to faith (echoing "faith alone"); there remains an insistence on an inner conversion experience. But even that inwardness is thin: it is inwardness as personal success story, not inwardness as humble submission to a transcendent truth.</p>

### Transnational Networks and Anti-Communist Roots
<p class="c0">The U.S. evangelical core is the hub of a global religious&#8208;right network united by shared ideology and anti-communist history. Even ostensibly non-evangelical groups like Japan's Unification Church have paralleled this agenda. In fact, Moon's Unification movement "set up media companies, research centers, and educational institutions that focused on anti-communist ideologies" in the 1950s–80s[^cite_83](^cite_83). Such groups forged ties with American conservatives (e.g. through the National Prayer Breakfast, founded by Abraham Vereide in 1953 as a Christian anti-Communist fellowship). Likewise, hardline Catholic organizations (Opus Dei and others) work alongside evangelicals in crusades against socialism, abortion, and secularism. These transnational alliances trace back to the Cold War: the Religious Right grew out of a "spiritual-industrial complex" aimed at defeating Marxism, using the rhetoric of a holy war to unite business leaders, pastors, and politicians. In practice, this means international conferences and family-value coalitions that blur denominational lines. The National Prayer Breakfast – an annual meeting of politicians, preachers, and foreign dignitaries – exemplifies this network in action. Across borders, evangelicals, Moonies, conservative Catholics, and right-wing Christians share resources and messaging, reinforcing each other's power. In each context, appeals to anti-communism and fear of "moral decay" form the backbone of an ideology that ultimately justifies the capitalist status quo.</p>

### Global Parallels: Emerging Patterns in Other Traditions
<p class="c0">While our focus is U.S. evangelicalism, similar religion-capital alliances are seen elsewhere. For example, Turkey under Erdo&#287;an has promoted a state-centric Sunni Islam that validates neoliberal economics and patriarchal social policies. The government encourages "faith-based" charity and conservative education that push a family-centered vision mirroring America's "family values," even as it embraces global capitalism. Scholars observe that many Islamic organizations in Turkey now function as instruments of neoliberal governmentality, disciplining women into traditional roles while integrating markets into daily life. In short, an "Islamic neoliberalism" is emerging: it shares with evangelicalism an emphasis on personal piety over social justice, and on reproducing existing hierarchies via moral authority. This is distinct from older "overcoded" forms like Wahhabi fundamentalism or state secularism; rather, it adapts religion to the demands of market society. Similar convergences can be seen in Hindu nationalism and other faith movements worldwide, where religion is recast to legitimate existing power structures while providing spiritual consolation.</p>

### Ideology and Affect: Theoretical Perspectives
<p class="c0">Drawing it all together, we can interpret evangelical capitalism with classic critical theories. Althusser's interpellation is strikingly on point: Christian ideology "addresses a human individual called Peter… in order to tell you that God exists and that you are answerable to Him," ultimately declaring "This is your place in the world! This is what you must do!"[^cite_84](^cite_84). In practice, sermons name congregants (even by name) and designate their roles (husband, wife, citizen), and believers respond, "Yes, this is me." This ritual hailing ensures each person recognizes the evangelical life-script as their destiny. Althusser notes that such interpellation presupposes a single "Absolute Other" (God) whose authority grounds the whole system[^cite_85](^cite_85).</p><p class="c0">In Foucault's terms, the evangelical church is a pastoral power that produces self-disciplined subjects. From childhood Sunday school through voluntary adult Bible classes, believers learn to monitor their own conduct (sexual, financial, personal) by internalizing evangelical norms. Confession and accountability groups further instill this self-governance. In effect, the church trains "docile bodies" aligned to capitalist society: believers police themselves to be productive, faithful citizens and parents. There is no need for external force; spirituality itself instils the desired behavior.</p><p class="c0">Walter Benjamin's insights on aestheticized politics also resonate. Benjamin argued that fascism turns politics into mass spectacle ("the logical outcome of fascism is an aestheticization of political life")[^cite_86](^cite_86). Similarly, evangelicalism often merges religion and politics into an emotional pageant. Mega-rallies, patriotically charged sermons, and prayer rallies treat political-economic orders as moral crusades. By politicizing religion in aesthetic form (flags at church, rhetoric of "righteous nation," culture-war marches), the movement channels dissent into spectacle rather than organized challenge. The effect is the same Benjamin described: people demand expression (e.g. a prayer rally) without effect on real power structures. Thus the evangelical Right's media-savvy events serve the status quo by satisfying the longing for change with gut-level theatrics.</p><p class="c0">Finally, Lewis Mumford's megamachine concept highlights the technological-totalitarian dimension. Mumford called modern tech-capitalism "the ultimate religion of our seemingly rational age," in which "the meaning of life was reduced to accelerating movement and change" and "bigger and bigger… faster and faster became ends in themselves"[^cite_87](^cite_87). Evangelicalism today inhabits that megatechnical environment. Digital streaming, social media algorithms, and consumer culture form a grand infrastructure that enfolds every church. Technology is worshipped alongside God (smartphones, megachurch sound systems, online influence). Evangelical media networks (TV preachers, podcasts, conference tours) are nodes of this megamachine. Believers are offered a steady stream of images and narratives of faith as remedy – a "mass-produced plentitude" as Mumford describes – which distracts from capitalism's harms. In short, the church is not separate from the megatechnical system but part of its priesthood. Evangelicalism's emphasis on individual salvation and trust in a "higher plan" functions in the same way Mumford saw blind faith in science and progress: it sustains the myth that the system can be redeemed (by God or technology) even as it grinds people under.</p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_973607v9i7pw-0 start"><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Marxism (ideology/opium): Religion is ideology that maintains class power. Evangelicalism preaches rewards in heaven to pacify earthly suffering[^cite_88](^cite_88).

Modern tech becomes a secular deity whose "accelerating change" is worshipped in place of social change[^cite_91](^cite_91).

It interpellates believers into predefined roles (patriarch/provider, submissive wife, obedient child, God-fearing worker) and disciplines them with promise of afterlife as the ultimate payout. Its religious aesthetics mirror those of consumer capitalism: flashy, immediate, emotionally satisfying, yet substantively empty. Through these means, U.S. evangelicalism promotes the capitalist status quo and legitimizes exploitation under a veneer of piety – an alliance of religion, desire, and power that only intensifies as late-stage capitalism advances.</p><p class="c0">Sources: Analysis above draws on contemporary and classical sources of political theology and critical theory, including evangelical commentators[^cite_92](^cite_92)[^cite_93](^cite_93) and left critiques[^cite_94](^cite_94)[^cite_95](^cite_95), integrated with theoretical insights from Althusser, Foucault, Benjamin, and Mumford[^cite_96](^cite_96)[^cite_97](^cite_97)[^cite_98](^cite_98).

### 1 Introduction: The Strange Career of the Latter-day Saints
<p class="c0">Nineteenth-century Mormonism erupted out of the Protestant "burned-over district" yet immediately rejected the disenchanted cosmos that mainline revivalism had normalized.  Joseph Smith's revelations insisted that all matter is eternal, that gods progress, and that humanity may join their ranks. This audacious cosmology fuelled experiments in consecrated property, plural marriage, and theocratic settlement—practices that, at their inception, looked more like utopian socialism than the bourgeois respectability later associated with Utah. Whereas Marx denounced religion as ideology, early Latter-day Saints weaponised myth to build a counter-economy; they tried to reterritorialise the capitalist frontier on communal lines even as they borrowed its techniques of movement and expansion.</p><p class="c0">We read Mormonism here through four lenses:</p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_25a4ywbr123e-0 start"><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Marx & primitive accumulation – Mormon consecration fought enclosure with a covenantal commons.<br></li><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Deleuze & Guattari's "re-enchantment machine" – Smith decoded Protestantism only to replug believers into an infinitely expandable cosmos.<br></li><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Walter Benjamin's dialectical image – the Nauvoo temple as a revolutionary montage of Israelite, Masonic, and American symbols.<br></li><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Lewis Mumford's "megamachine" – Brigham Young's territorial kingdom anticipates the technocratic state yet briefly subordinates it to agrarian cooperation.<br></li></ul><hr><p class="c2"></p>

### 2 Cosmos Reclaimed: Eternal Matter and the Adam-God Turn

#### 2.1 Material Spirit and Eternal Progress
<p class="c0">Smith's May 1843 discourse declared that "spirit is a refined matter" and that intelligence "cannot be created or made"[^cite_177](^cite_177)[^cite_100](^cite_100). Matter itself is divine; the world is enchanted down to its atoms. Snow's famous couplet turns this into eschatology: humans may ascend the same ontological ladder God once climbed. Where classical Christianity saw an unbridgeable Creator-creature gap, Mormonism installs a cosmic proletariat: every being can rise by cooperative labor—temple work, covenant, and family sealing.</p>

#### 2.2 The Adam-God Doctrine as Radical Genealogy
<p class="c0">Brigham Young's sermons went further: "Adam is our Father and God… the God of the earth"[^cite_178](^cite_178)[^cite_101](^cite_101). Scholars debate the doctrine's orthodoxy, but politically it relocated sovereignty from a distant omnipotence to the first embodied patriarch. In Deleuzian terms, Young folds divinity back into the plane of immanence, short-circuiting the transcendent despotic signifier. God becomes an ancestor-king whose authority is genealogical rather than absolutist—a move that both empowers communal kin-structures and risks reinforcing patriarchal domination.</p><hr><p class="c2"></p>

### 3 Consecration, the United Orders, and Anti-Capitalist Praxis

#### 3.1 Law of Consecration
<p class="c0">Revelations of 1831 introduced a covenant to "hold all things in common" and appoint bishops as stewards[^cite_179](^cite_179)[^cite_102](^cite_102). Private property was to be subordinated to need; surplus redistributed. This resembles the primitive Christian communism of Acts and echoes Fourierist and Owenite experiments sprouting across America.</p>

#### 3.2 United Orders as Communal Corporations
<p class="c0">From Kirtland (1830s) to Brigham City (1870s) the church organised United Orders—civic-economic co-ops where families deeded land to a common fund and received stewardships in return[^cite_180](^cite_180)[^cite_103](^cite_103). These orders:</p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_u5unn74ef5b9-0 start"><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Abolished wage labour among saints.<br></li><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Fixed prices collectively to undercut speculators.<br></li><li class="c0 c12 li-bullet-0">Instituted bishop's storehouses as proto-welfare.<br></li></ul><p class="c0">Marx might read this as an anti-enclosure revolt: a frontier commons against national banks and railroad capital. Yet the Orders collapsed under federal pressure, internal inequality, and Utah's integration into transcontinental markets—illustrating Benjamin's insight that every revolutionary "image" is shot through with its counter-image of defeat.</p><hr><p class="c2"></p>

### 4 Contradictions: Polygyny, Patriarchy, and the Color Line
<p class="c0">Radical cosmology coexisted with radical patriarchy. Plural marriage concentrated authority in male priesthood; the Adam-God myth literalised male divinity. Simultaneously, Brigham Young codified a priesthood/racial ban (1852–1978) that excluded Black saints from temple rites[^cite_181](^cite_181)[^cite_104](^cite_104). Thus a movement born in communitarian aspiration reproduced settler hierarchies—an ambivalence Deleuze would call the "simultaneity of deterritorialisation and reterritorialisation."</p><hr><p class="c2"></p>

### 5 Comparative Interlude

#### 5.1 State Shinto and Imperial Theosis
<p class="c0">Meiji leaders nationalised Shinto in 1868, enthroning the Emperor as living deity to mobilise agrarian subjects for industrial empire[^cite_182](^cite_182)[^cite_105](^cite_105). Like Mormonism, State&#8239;Shinto used genealogy (sun-descended Tenn&#333;) and temple ritual to sacralise settlement (Hokkaid&#333;) and communal labour. Both projects fused myth with colonisation, but where State Shinto enforced hierarchy, early Mormonism preached lay theosis and voluntary consecration.</p>

#### 5.2 God-Building under Soviet Socialism
<p class="c0">Lunacharsky's bogostroitel'stvo sought an atheist civic cult harnessing ritual and myth for proletarian uplift[^cite_183](^cite_183)[^cite_106](^cite_106). Mormon temple liturgy—with its Masonic dramas and covenantal oaths—already performed a similar myth-engineering, but in a theistic register. Both movements reveal how modern projects —imperial, socialist, or sectarian—turn to new theurgies when Enlightenment rationality proves cold.</p><hr><p class="c2"></p>

### 6 From Kingdom of God to Corporation of the President
<p class="c0">Railroads, federal anti-polygamy campaigns, and the 1890 Manifesto forced Utah's integration. By the mid-20th century the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had become one of America's wealthiest corporations, investing in media, insurance, and global real estate. The communal Orders were replaced by tithing and for-profit subsidiaries; polygamy was renounced; racial bans persisted until 1978. Mumford's "megamachine" triumphs: the church now operates data centers and maintains an online genealogy empire—redeeming the dead with cloud computing rather than agrarian commons. Cosmic optimism survives, but the cooperative economy has been thoroughly reterritorialised by finance capital.</p><hr><p class="c2"></p>

### 7 Conclusion: A Dialectical Legacy
<p class="c0">Early Mormonism dramatises a recurring theme in this book: attempts to re-enchant and re-common the world under capitalist pressure. Smith's material cosmology and the United Orders were genuine gestures toward what Benjamin called "the weak messianic power" of the oppressed. Yet patriarchal and racial exclusions, plus the irresistible pull of westward markets, foreclosed the most radical possibilities. Today, LDS humanitarianism and missionary networks mirror neoliberal NGO logic, while temple theology still whispers the old promise of godhood. Mormonism thus stands as a dialectical image—at once a frontier socialism and a template for corporate religion—offering both caution and inspiration to contemporary movements seeking to reclaim myth and economics from the dead hand of capital.</p><hr><p class="c2"></p>

### Cosmic Enchantment and Zion Ideal: Early Mormonism as Utopian Reform
<p class="c0">Early Mormonism emerged in the 1830s as a radically re-enchanted vision of Christianity. In Weberian terms, Joseph Smith embodied charismatic authority – a living prophet whose revelations transformed theology and social organization[^cite_115](^cite_115)[^cite_116](^cite_116). Unlike Protestant individual salvation, Smith's revelations envisioned a physical cosmos imbued with sacred meaning. In Mormon doctrine all intelligence and matter are eternal – "God is an Architect of the material universe, not the Source of all things"[^cite_117](^cite_117)[^cite_118](^cite_118). Thus God and man share the same kind of substance: early Mormons taught that humans are literally "gods in embryo," destined to progress eternally toward divine fullness[^cite_119](^cite_119). Brigham Young even preached the controversial "Adam–God" theory – that the first man Adam was himself God the Father[^cite_120](^cite_120) – a startling affirmation of Mormon pantheon. These doctrines re-enchanted the world: nature and history were charged with mythic significance, and the temple was imagined as a direct pattern of heaven on earth (Eliade's sacred space). As Mircea Eliade observed, religious rites recreate a primordial "mythic time"; LDS temple ceremonies explicitly dramatize creation–fall–exaltation myths, sanctifying place and moment[^cite_121](^cite_121). In this early phase the universe was not a bare mechanism but a living cosmos of gods, spirits, and humans evolving together.</p><p class="c0">Concretely, this re-enchantment included planets, angels, and multiple worlds. The Book of Abraham (LDS scripture) describes councils of gods organizing matter to build worlds[^cite_122](^cite_122). Joseph Smith taught that every righteous man receives a kingdom and may "increase in glory" forever. This cosmic theology contrasts sharply with the "disenchanted" world of 19th-century Protestant liberalism (Weber's secular age) – Mormonism insisted on eternal progression and a material universe, defying the notion that spirit is immaterial or distant[^cite_123](^cite_123)[^cite_124](^cite_124).</p>

### Communal Zion and Anti-Capitalist Praxis
<p class="c0">Early Mormons did not just dream; they acted on utopian ideals. The Book of Mormon itself envisions an "ideal society" where "there were no poor among them" because "all things [were](were) common"[^cite_125](^cite_125). In practice Joseph Smith ordained a Law of Consecration: followers deeded property to the Church and received stewardships of land. In Kirtland (Ohio) and Missouri (1830s), Latter-day Saints attempted quasi-communist communities based on these revelations[^cite_126](^cite_126). Inspired by millennial egalitarianism, they set up cooperative businesses, shared livestock and tools, and even started the Kirtland Safety Society bank as a communal credit venture. Later, under Brigham Young in Utah, dozens of United Order settlements were launched: local wards deeded property to the bishop and held "stewardships," returning surplus production to a communal storehouse[^cite_127](^cite_127). These egalitarian communities aimed to eliminate poverty and dependence on outsider markets – "free the Mormons from dependence on outside merchants, and eliminate poverty"[^cite_128](^cite_128).</p><p class="c0">This communalism explicitly opposed the new market capitalism of the age. As one historian notes, most 19th-century Mormonism "rejected capitalist development and preached Christian communalism"[^cite_129](^cite_129). Mormons had suffered through Jacksonian market crashes and land speculation; in response they built communal storehouses, welfare kitchens, and joint labor projects (including relief farming and company towns). Young even declared "I will cut deeper than the ancients: they proposed to be equal, I propose to give equal" (paraphrased from Brigham). The United Orders and Zion projects resembled other utopian socialist experiments (e.g. Owenite or Shaker communities), challenging "fundamental ideals" of American society – private property, republican politics, capitalist competition, and monogamous family norms[^cite_130](^cite_130)[^cite_131](^cite_131). Plural marriage itself broke bourgeois conventions of the family. In short, Mormonism offered a nearly communistic alternative: pooled resources, centralized planning by local bishops, and the credo of "no poor among them"[^cite_132](^cite_132)[^cite_133](^cite_133).</p><p class="c0">Marxist anthropology would note that early Mormon Zion sought to create a classless "Kingdom of God" on earth, presaging aspects of socialism. Church intellectuals like Hugh Nibley later lamented that the modern church abandoned these values[^cite_134](^cite_134). By the 1890s, under outside pressure (polygamy prosecutions, federal taxes) most communal programs ceased and Utah joined the U.S.; Mormons "embrac[ed](ed) market capitalism" to survive[^cite_135](^cite_135). The United Orders disappeared in mainstream LDS life (surviving only in fringe fundamentalist sects[^cite_136](^cite_136)), and Church leaders publicly denounced socialism. What remained of communalism was absorbed into the Church welfare and self-reliance system (a moderated version of Zion's charities)[^cite_137](^cite_137). In Marx's terms, the early Mormon "base" (property relations) shifted back into the capitalist superstructure, and religion now began to reinforce rather than challenge the existing order.</p>

### Theocratic Kingdom and Mythic History
<p class="c0">Parallel to economic communalism was an ambitious theocratic vision. Joseph Smith conceived a future "Kingdom of God" on earth, blending civil and sacred authority. In 1844 he organized the secret Council of Fifty, whose purpose was explicitly "to symbolize and represent a future theocratic or theodemocratic Kingdom of God on the earth"[^cite_138](^cite_138). Smith even ran for U.S. President on a platform of restoring liberty under God. The Council's records speak of a coming millennial polity in which Christ would reign, and Smith foresaw Mormons governing a New Jerusalem. (LDS teaching held that during the Millennium Jesus will be "king of this new world government," whose structure was planned to be quasi-republican[^cite_139](^cite_139).) In 19th-century Mormon talk, America's Constitution was "of no worth" after the Millennium and the Saints would build Zion according to celestial law.</p><p class="c0">This messianic-political impulse was fundamentally mythic in Eliade's sense: it framed time as a cycle of sacred eras. Early Latter-day Saints saw themselves living out the dramatis personae of scriptures (Book of Mormon, Bible, Revelation). The temple endowment ceremony, introduced in Nauvoo, reenacted the Edenic creation, the fall, and the gathering of Israel – literally bringing the preterrestrial "plan of salvation" into ritual time. Eliade would note that such rituals create an eternal return to primordial time; indeed LDS temples were designed as terrestrial reflections of heaven (the Salt Lake Temple as an axis mundi in the city)[^cite_140](^cite_140). Adam's story, Elijah's powers, and the eventual return of Enoch and Zion were all taught as imminent realities. In short, early Mormonism was steeped in mythic cosmology – a sacred history that unfolded across ages (pre-existence, mortality, Millennium) rather than the linear demystified history of Enlightenment Protestantism.</p>

### Routinizing Revelation: From Charisma to Bureaucracy
<p class="c0">Marxist and Weberian theory illuminate how this cosmic, radical movement then transformed into a modern institution. Weber described how "charismatic" movements must institutionalize or perish. Mormon history epitomizes this: after Smith's martyrdom the church faced the Weberian task of translating "ground-breaking and world-making revelations into a set of handbooks and teacher's manuals"[^cite_141](^cite_141). By the late 19th century Brigham Young and successors turned the church into a bureaucratic organization. Revelation was disciplined into coded scriptures (Doctrine & Covenants) and rules; the living prophet's role was reserved to a First Presidency with a quorum of twelve apostles; local government and education came under church auspices. The charismatic frenzy of Missouri or Kirtland was tamed by new legitimacy claims: prophetic heritage, scriptural canon, and sacred ordinances.</p><p class="c0">The 20th century saw further routinization. Under leaders like David O. McKay and especially during the "Era of Standardization" (circa 1960s–70s), the Church consolidated authority into a global bureaucracy. A correlation program systematized all lesson manuals, budgets, and publications under priesthood oversight[^cite_142](^cite_142). As one insider laments, this "huge effort…to amass all leadership, budgets, publications, and teaching materials under one hierarchical…umbrella" sought uniformity at the cost of doctrinal breadth[^cite_143](^cite_143). Decentralized "rogue" sermons and local folklore were largely stamped out, replaced by bland, centrally approved curriculum. In Weberian terms, the Mormon church became a textbook case of the routinization of charisma: spiritual spontaneity gave way to legal-rational authority and bureaucratic order[^cite_144](^cite_144).</p><p class="c0">By the 1970s the transformation was complete: LDS worship and practice were almost entirely standardized worldwide. Lavish temples and tabernacles proliferated globally, but their rituals and furnishings became homogeneous. The exuberant, apocalyptic message of early leaders – about common lands, imminent kingdoms, and Adam-God – was toned down or quietly abandoned. The Church's own historical narratives were sanitized (e.g. polygamy minimized, Adam-God officially denounced[^cite_145](^cite_145)). Instead, the focus shifted to individual family and corporate success. In worship services, a modest "Restoration" message emphasizing the familiar themes of family, faith, and work ethic replaced the old radicalism.</p>

### Self-Colonization and Neoliberal Accommodation
<p class="c0">This institutional drift can be seen as a kind of self-colonization. Once a sect at odds with America, the LDS Church gradually colonized itself by internalizing prevailing bourgeois norms. Kathleen Flake calls the early-20th-century response to the Reed Smoot hearings "The Great Accommodation": facing scrutiny, Mormons adopted "the terms in which [nation](nation)(the) would accept Mormonism"[^cite_146](^cite_146). Senator Smoot became the image of the respectable Mormon – a patriotic, business-suit wearing apostle, not Brigham Young's bearded polygamist avatar[^cite_147](^cite_147). During WWI and WWII, Mormons "over-subscribed" their draft quotas to prove they were "superpatriotic," recasting themselves as model Americans[^cite_148](^cite_148). The Church publicly embraced patriotism, business success, and conservative morality (antivice campaigns), aligning with the mid-century Republican-Protestant consensus. The powerful LDS lobby even argued that Mormon welfare doctrines mirrored New Deal social gospel (rather than critique capitalism).</p><p class="c0">Under late 20th-century neoliberalism the accommodation became deeper. Mormon theology ceased to challenge capitalism; in fact, it sanctified free-market virtues. Brighamite wealth and self-reliance became doctrinal cornerstones, and overt class critique vanished. The Church accumulated corporate assets (insurance, real estate, media) and taught members entrepreneurship and home ownership. Social life was organized on family-centered, consumer lines (family home evenings, home building contests, college tuition subsidies) rather than communal sharing. Religious identity became aestheticized and privatized: ritual practice still rich, but its revolutionary edge removed. In Benjaminian terms, what was once a politically charged, communal mythology has turned into a kind of apolitical "civil religion" – scripture and temple life lend an aura of sacred order, but the aim is conformity and unity rather than liberation.</p><p class="c0">The result is a world-shrinking LDS trajectory. Where Joseph Smith once envisioned multiple worlds and theocracy, the modern Church offers a world-now model: local congregations in every nation, a universally rationalized organizational chart, and an emphasis on personal salvation and social conservatism. Orthodox Mormonism today reproduces mainstream norms (middle-class domesticity, entrepreneurial drive, bureaucratic governance) far more than it seeks to expand cosmic horizons. The utopian Zion has been replaced by ward council meetings; millennial anticipation is channeled into temple attendance quotas. In the language of religious sociology, early Mormonism's maximally enchanted, anti-capitalist orientation has been largely subsumed by a neoliberal-capitalist logic of self-improvement and institutional stability.</p><p class="c0">Nonetheless, echoes of the old dispensation survive in the Church's rhetoric of hope and unity. Terms like "Zion" and "eternal progression" remain in hymnals, and welfare service recalls communal beginnings. Yet these now coexist with (and often serve) an ethos of conformity. The Mormon journey from world-expanding prophet-dream to world-normalizing bureaucracy mirrors a broader pattern: radical religious movements often start by imagining a radically different cosmos, only to end by settling into the contours of the prevailing social order. Early Mormonism's radical cosmic re-enchantment and communal economy gave way, in the era of correlation and globalization, to a corporate structure and aestheticized faith aligned with late modern capitalism. This arc—from prophets who sought to overthrow old orders to a Church that upholds them—illustrates both the transformative potential of religion and its capacity for self-domestication in modern society.</p><p class="c0">Sources: Scholarly analyses and historical documents on early LDS theology and practice[^cite_149](^cite_149)[^cite_150](^cite_150)[^cite_151](^cite_151)[^cite_152](^cite_152); critiques and histories of Mormon communalism and politics[^cite_153](^cite_153)[^cite_154](^cite_154); LDS scriptures and writings on material cosmology[^cite_155](^cite_155)[^cite_156](^cite_156); contemporary accounts of institutional rationalization and correlation[^cite_157](^cite_157).</p><p class="c21 c10"></p><p class="c10 c21"></p>
