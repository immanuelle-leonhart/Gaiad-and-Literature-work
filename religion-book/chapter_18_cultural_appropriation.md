# Closed practices chapter

The term **“closed practice”** has gained prominence in recent years, especially within neo-pagan, witchcraft, and online spiritual communities. In broad terms, a closed practice refers to a **religious or ritual practice that is restricted** – typically to members of a particular culture, community, or lineage – and **not freely open to everyone**. As one pagan writer succinctly explains: *“Closed practices are those that you can only be a part of if you were born into the community, or if you have been initiated into it.”*[^cite_1](^cite_1) In other words, an “open” practice is accessible to anyone, while a “closed” practice requires some form of **insider status**, whether by birth, heritage, or formal initiation​.[^cite_2](^cite_2) This concept has become central in discussions of **cultural appropriation** and respect for boundaries in spirituality. It is especially emphasized in online spaces (Tumblr blogs, Discord groups, Reddit forums) where modern pagans and witches deliberate what practices outsiders should *not* partake in.

Importantly, the idea of closed practices is **not an entirely new phenomenon**. Many religions throughout history have drawn lines around who may participate in certain rituals or access certain knowledge. However, the *language* of “open vs. closed practice” – and the specific concerns about cultural theft or misuse – have emerged in particular force within **20th–21st century discourse**. This report examines the academic history and discussion of closed practices: from early critiques of “plastic shamans” in the 1970s–80s, through the term’s origin in neo-pagan communities, to contemporary online debates and scholarly analyses. We will also highlight well-documented examples of restricted rituals in world religions (such as Catholic sacraments, initiation rites, or lineage-based esoteric knowledge) to see how they compare to the modern label of a “closed practice.” Throughout, the focus will be on **academic and anthropological perspectives** – how scholars of religion, anthropology, and philosophy have articulated or critiqued the notion of closed practices – rather than on purely informal debate.

## Historical Origins: From “Plastic Shamans” to Cultural Protection
Issues of outsiders appropriating sacred traditions were already a point of contention by the late 20th century. In the 1970s and 1980s, as New Age spirituality and neo-shamanism grew in popularity, Native American communities began **speaking out against the misuse of their ceremonies**. Activists coined the term **“plastic shaman”** to denounce non-Native gurus and authors who profited from imitations of Indigenous rituals[^cite_3](^cite_3)[^cite_4](^cite_4). For example, anthropologist Lisa Aldred noted in 2000 that *“Euro-Americans professing to be medicine people have profited from publications and workshops”* selling purported Native wisdom.[^cite_5](^cite_5) By the late 1980s, Native activists were directly confronting these exploiters: the American Indian Movement (AIM) even disrupted “plastic medicine men” workshops and publicly **condemned those who profited from Native ceremonies.**[^cite_6](^cite_6) A famous statement from a 1993 gathering of Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota leaders – *“A Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality”* – declared *“war against all persons who persist in exploiting, abusing, and misrepresenting the sacred traditions and spiritual practices”* of Indigenous peoples[^cite_7](^cite_7)[^cite_8](^cite_8). This strong language underscored that certain rituals (e.g. the Lakota Sun Dance or sacred pipe ceremonies) were **not meant for outsiders**, especially not for commercial gain.

Such activism laid an important foundation for the **ethic of closed practices**. The message was that Indigenous spiritual knowledge is *not open-access* and that unauthorized use by outsiders is a form of harm or **colonial theft**. Anthropologists and scholars took note of these developments. Aldred, for instance, described how New Age appropriation amounts to a *“commercialization of Native American spirituality”* and how Indigenous peoples’ objections were rooted in the feeling that their sacred traditions were being degraded and **exploited by those with no real authority**[^cite_9](^cite_9)[^cite_10](^cite_10). In effect, Native critics were asserting that these ceremonies are *closed* – to be conducted only by those within the culture or by persons explicitly sanctioned. This early discourse did not yet use the term “closed practice,” but it articulated the **core principle**: *not everything is free for outsiders to take*. As one commentator later summarized, *“everything is not open property just because we wish it to be so… everything is not ours to take, everything is not ours to sell”.*[^cite_11](^cite_11)

These debates in the 1970s–90s predominantly involved **Indigenous and New Age contexts**, but they influenced neo-pagan communities as well. Many neo-pagans in the 1960s–80s had freely borrowed from a variety of global traditions in forming new Witchcraft and Pagan practices. For example, modern Wicca – founded by Gerald Gardner mid-20th century – cobbled together elements from ceremonial magic, folk practices, Eastern philosophy, and even Indigenous lore[^cite_12](^cite_12). By the 1980s, prominent Pagan authors like Starhawk and others were incorporating Native American terms (such as “smudging” with sage) or aspects of Afro-Caribbean religions into eclectic Witchcraft manuals. At the time, this syncretism was often seen as positive and creative. However, as **post-colonial awareness grew**, some pagans began to question whether *borrowing could become stealing*. The late 1980s and early 90s saw pagan writers start to acknowledge cultural appropriation as a problem. For instance, at the 1993 Parliament of the World’s Religions, Indigenous representatives forcefully criticized New Age and Pagan appropriations of their rites. This created a ripple effect: **respect for closed traditions** slowly entered the ethics of Pagan circles. By the mid-1990s, certain practices (like the sweat lodge, vision quest, or use of specific sacred herbs) were increasingly understood by Pagans to be **off-limits unless one had proper permission or training**. In essence, the concept of “closed practice” was germinating – even if it wasn’t yet called that – through these early cultural appropriation debates.

## Contrast between modern settings and the plastic shamans controversy
A notable contrast between then and now is the relative lack of contemporary commercialization. 

## Emergence of the Term in Neo-Pagan Communities
Within neo-pagan and witchcraft communities, the explicit terminology of **“closed” vs. “open” practices** seems to have crystallized in the 2000s and 2010s. Scholars note that by the 2010s, discussions of cultural appropriation had become *“a central topic in the witch and neopagan community”*, especially online[^cite_13](^cite_13). An important study by Kathryn Gottlieb (2017) traced how this discourse evolved on the blogging platform Tumblr, which in the 2010s hosted a vibrant “witchblr” subculture. Gottlieb explains that neo-pagans began distinguishing **open religions** (those *“available to everyone who wishes to practice them”*) from **closed religions** (those in which *“one must be born or initiated”* to participate)[^cite_14](^cite_14). In practice, community members were creating **informal lists** of which spiritual traditions or rituals were considered closed. A Reddit user’s explanation captures the emerging consensus: *“A closed practice is any practice that requires some type of initiation to take part in. A well-known example would be Catholic communion – you must be baptized (initiated) to receive it.”*[^cite_15](^cite_15) While people often cite indigenous and magical traditions, this user’s example shows they were also framing even Christian sacraments in terms of “closed” access. The vocabulary of *closed/open practice* thus provided a new, simple heuristic: **open = free for all; closed = requires invitation, initiation, or cultural belonging**.
Online neo-pagan forums in the 2010s frequently debated specific cases. For example, many agreed that **Native American spiritual ceremonies, Afro-Caribbean religions like Vodou and Santería, and Romani (Gypsy) folk practices** were closed practices not open to outsiders.[^cite_16](^cite_16) An editorial on decolonizing paganism gives typical reasoning: *Burning **white sage** and calling it “smudging” is closed to anyone who is not part of the Indigenous community.*[^cite_17](^cite_17) The same author notes that **Vodou** and other African-based traditions are also closed: *“Most of these practices are closed as well. To join Vodou, one must find a priest and commit to the practice. Like Kabbalah, it is not something that can just be [up casually](picked)”*[^cite_18](^cite_18) Here we see two important factors that pagans consider: **ancestry** (being part of an indigenous community) and **initiation under elders** (finding a priest, being taught). If a person lacks those, the practice is deemed *“not for you.”* In line with this, many Tumblr posts admonished eclectic witches to **avoid appropriating closed practices** and to seek alternative, culturally appropriate substitutes. For instance, instead of smudging with white sage (a plant sacred to certain Native tribes), non-Native witches were encouraged to use other herbs for smoke cleansing, or simply refer to the act as generic **“cleansing”** rather than using the word “smudge”[^cite_19](^cite_19). Terminology became a sensitive point: using the *correct names* and not claiming titles like “shaman” or “voodoo priest” without credentials was part of respecting closed traditions.

It’s noteworthy that **neo-paganism itself has both open and closed dimensions**. Some neopagan traditions are *initiatory* (for example, Gardnerian Wicca is famously **closed to non-initiates**, with secret rituals and oath-bound lore). Others are more open and eclectic. This internal reality may have primed pagans to understand the closed/open distinction. As one occultist pointed out, *“Gardnerian Wicca is a ‘closed’ practice – initiates only – … Buddhism was once initiates-only, as was early Christianity”*[^cite_20](^cite_20). In other words, exclusivity in spiritual practice has precedent. However, what is new is the *moral valuation* attached to it. In online pagan discourse, labeling something a **closed practice often carries a strong prescriptive tone**: outsiders *should not* partake, lest they commit cultural appropriation. This goes beyond simply “secret versus public” rites; it ties into **social justice** and anti-colonial ethics. One Tumblr user described the dynamic pointedly: *“If you are integrating cultural practices from natives who are **not open to sharing them** with outsiders… you are appropriating – that is why we are discussing this term.”*[^cite_21](^cite_21). In short, neo-pagans on platforms like Tumblr, Reddit, and Discord came to see guarding closed practices as a way to **honor marginalized cultures** and prevent the “theft” of spiritual resources by those in the dominant culture[^cite_22](^cite_22)[^cite_23](^cite_23).

Over the last decade, numerous **online communities and resources sprung up to educate practitioners** on this subject. Guides and blog posts enumerate which deities, herbs, rituals or symbols are off-limits unless you belong to the originating culture. For example, the Tumblr blog *“hopeful spirits”* regularly reminds readers that **Gaelic polytheism is *not*** a closed practice – pushing back against a misconception that one must have Celtic blood to worship Irish gods. *“Gaelic polytheism is not a closed practice. You do not need to be from Ireland, Scotland, or Man or have any ‘Celtic blood’ to worship the Gods, Ancestors, and Spirits,”* one post states, adding that *“Anyone who tells you different is misinformed at best or probably a racist at worst.”*[^cite_24](^cite_24). This example highlights an important nuance: the closed practice discourse itself is **contested and policed within the community**. Some worry that calling a practice “closed” can slide into ethnic essentialism (e.g. saying only people of certain ancestry can participate, which can sound like a “blood and soil” ideology). Thus, even as many neo-pagans embrace the closed/open framework, there are internal debates about **what falls where**. Which traditions are truly closed? Who has the authority to say so? These questions continue to be hashed out on forums and group chats. Indeed, some online groups have banned the topic altogether to avoid fights – on Reddit’s r/witchcraft, moderators discourage “gatekeeping” discussions and treat any publicly available information as fair game for learning[^cite_25](^cite_25). This underscores that “closed practice” is not a unanimously agreed doctrine, but rather a **living conversation** in the community.

## Examples of Closed Practices in Religious Traditions
To better grasp what “closed practice” means, it is useful to look at concrete examples of **restricted ritual or spiritual access** across various religions. Many mainstream religious traditions have long maintained certain *boundaries* around who may participate in what – though their logic may differ from the modern neo-pagan usage. These examples will illustrate how **diverse the forms of restriction** can be, and how they sometimes align with, or differ from, the contemporary label *“closed practice.”*

- **Catholic Sacraments (Closed Communion):** In Christianity, the idea of *“closed communion”* is centuries old. The Catholic Church, for instance, reserves the Eucharist (Holy Communion) for baptized Catholics in good standing. Non-Christians (and even Christians of other denominations) are not ordinarily permitted to receive the Eucharist at a Catholic Mass​[^cite_26](^cite_26). As a Catholic explainer notes, *“Non-Christians cannot receive Communion because they have not received baptism, the gateway to the other sacraments.”*[^cite_27](^cite_27) This is a clear example of a **functional restriction** based on initiation – baptism is effectively an entry rite. Historically, the early Church was even more guarded: in antiquity, the unbaptized were literally ushered out of the church before the Eucharistic prayers began. The rationale here is theological (to protect the sanctity of the sacrament and ensure recipients understand its meaning) rather than stemming from cultural ownership. Anyone *may* become Catholic through conversion, and thereafter participate; thus the practice is closed in a **membership sense**, but not ethnically. This shows a key difference: “closed” in the context of a church means *“members only”*, whereas in neo-pagan cultural discourse, it often means *“outsiders can never truly become insiders,”* except perhaps by rare adoption or heritage.
- **Jewish Traditions and Kabbalah:** Some religions are *ethnically* inflected in their closed practices. Judaism does allow conversion, but it traditionally does not seek converts, and some esoteric aspects are discouraged for outsiders. For example, **Kabbalah**, the mystical tradition in Judaism, was historically restricted to learned Jewish practitioners (often males over 40 who had mastered Torah and Talmud). In neo-pagan circles, one often hears that *“Jewish witchcraft is closed; if you are not Jewish, you cannot use parts of Kabbalah.”*[^cite_28](^cite_28) Indeed, Jewish voices have objected to non-Jews casually appropriating Kabbalistic symbols or rituals. The pop-occult “Kabbalah Center” (with celebrity non-Jewish followers) drew criticism from rabbis for this reason. Here we see a case where **lineage and religious identity blur** – Kabbalah is closed because it is deeply embedded in the Jewish faith and Hebrew language. Without that context, one is missing the necessary initiation (in this case, being part of the covenant of Judaism). This example aligns with the modern closed-practice concept: it’s about **cultural/religious ownership** of a practice (Jews for Kabbalah, in this framing). Notably though, Judaism does permit conversion; a converted Jew would be as Jewish as any other and could partake of Kabbalah study in traditional settings. Thus, from an academic view, we might say Kabbalah is *relatively* closed – requiring entry into the community first. Although Judaism and Kabbalah raise additional issues that will be raised in their own section later.
- **Initiation-Based Mystery Cults:** Throughout history, many societies have had **secret rites and mystery religions** that only initiates could attend. A famous example is the **Eleusinian Mysteries** of ancient Greece. These were sacred rituals in honor of Demeter and Persephone, celebrated for nearly 2000 years, in which participants had to undergo an initiation and oath of secrecy. The rites and knowledge revealed at Eleusis were *kept strictly secret* from the uninitiated public.{{Citation needed}} . Initiates from all over the Greek world (including women, men, free and enslaved persons of any ethnicity) could participate, but *only* if they underwent the prescribed initiation – and they were sworn not to reveal the Mysteries on pain of death. In modern terms, Eleusis was clearly a **closed practice**: one could not simply walk in and observe without being part of the initiated group, and its “membership” was defined by ritual initiation rather than by culture or lineage. Academically, such cults are often termed **“mystery religions”** or **“esoteric societies.”** They illustrate that long before the current debates, **religious secrecy and restricted access** were common. The purpose was often to safeguard sacred knowledge and enhance group bonds. Similarly, in the **Freemasonry** fraternity (originating in the 18th century but drawing on older secret society models), one must be initiated through degrees to learn the inner rituals. These forms of closed practice are based on **initiation and oath** as the gatekeeping mechanism – conceptually similar to how neo-pagans describe “must be initiated” for, say, Haitian Vodou or Wicca.
- **Lineage and Secret Societies in Indigenous Contexts:** Anthropological literature is rich with examples of **closed ceremonial societies** in Indigenous cultures worldwide. In parts of West and Central Africa, for instance, societies like the **Poro and Sande** (in Sierra Leone, Liberia, etc.) or the **Ogboni** (among the Yoruba of Nigeria) are closed fraternities with secret rites. Members undergo rigorous initiations, and there are often penalties – even death – for insiders who divulge secrets to outsiders​[^cite_29](^cite_29)[^cite_30](^cite_30). Knowledge in these societies is tiered: initiates learn progressively deeper secrets, and the uninitiated are not allowed to witness certain ceremonies at all. In many Australian Aboriginal communities, there are “men’s business” and “women’s business” rituals that are strictly segregated; only initiated men can see certain sacred objects or art, for example. Outsiders to the culture are generally *never* permitted access to these secret traditions, and even uninitiated community members may be excluded until undergoing the proper rites. Anthropologists have had to tread carefully – early ethnographers who published secret details earned lasting distrust. These indigenous secret-cult examples highlight a form of closed practice grounded in **sacred secrecy and group identity**. Unlike the neo-pagan discourse (which often centers on preventing *cultural exploitation*), in these cases the concern is often **cosmic or social order** – i.e., that powerful ritual knowledge, if misused or revealed to the wrong people, could bring harm or lose its efficacy. Nonetheless, the net effect is similar: there are clear boundaries beyond which an outsider (or uninitiated person) *must not cross*. The modern language of “closed practice” can certainly describe these scenarios.
- **Initiatory African-Diaspora Religions:** Religions like **Haitian Vodou, Cuban Santería (Regla de Ocha), Candomblé, and Hoodoo/Rootwork** often come up in current debates. These traditions are rooted in specific ethnic and historical experiences (e.g. Vodou in the Haitian context of former enslaved Africans and Catholic influence). They typically have **formal initiation ceremonies (kanzo in Vodou, making Ocha in Santería, etc.)** which induct a person into the priesthood or society of the religion. Without initiation, one might attend public ceremonies or be a client, but one is not a full practitioner. Importantly, these traditions *do* accept sincere outsiders in many lineages – there are white and non-African-descended priests of Vodou and Santería, for example, who were properly initiated. However, from the perspective of an outsider looking in (and certainly from the perspective of *internet discourse*), Vodou and related faiths are considered **closed practices**. You cannot simply read a book and declare yourself a Vodou priest; you must go through the community’s own channels​.[^cite_31](^cite_31) Practically, this is an initiation-based restriction akin to the Eleusinian example, but it’s also bound up with **cultural identity** (since these faiths carry the heritage of marginalized peoples). Scholars of religion point out that such traditions manage a **balance between openness and protection**: they often welcome *genuine seekers* who apprentice under a house and undergo the rites, but they strongly reject dilettantes or commercial exploiters. Indeed, the very term “**Hoodoo**” in African-American communities has an element of closed secrecy – for generations it was practiced quietly within black communities, and knowledge was passed down in families or mentor relationships, kept out of mainstream view. Today, one sees debates (especially on platforms like TikTok or Tumblr) about whether non-black practitioners can or should do Hoodoo; many black American practitioners assert it is a **closed practice belonging to African-American heritage**, cautioning outsiders against cherry-picking spells or sacred songs from it.
- **“Conversion-Restricted” Religions:** Some entire religions are traditionally *closed* in the sense that they do not accept converts or make it exceedingly difficult. For example, the **Parsi Zoroastrians** (Indian Zoroastrians descended from Persian immigrants) historically do not admit new converts – one must be born into a Zoroastrian family to be recognized. Similarly, certain Hindu temples or sects have rules barring non-Hindus from entering sacred precincts (e.g. the Jagannath Temple in Puri, India prohibits non-Hindus from entry). These cases are about **ethnic or hereditary criteria** for participation. They complicate the neat open/closed binary: Is Hindu worship “closed” or “open”? Hinduism as a whole has no conversion sacrament and is broad, but specific lineages and temple communities may be closed to outsiders. Anthropologist Michael Lambek and others have noted that some cultures conceive religion as an inalienable inheritance – *you can’t just adopt it at will*. This outlook resonates with the neo-pagan insistence that *certain practices belong to a people* and outsiders can’t just help themselves. However, it’s worth noting that many world religions have *opened up over time* – for instance, **Buddhism** in its early monastic form required joining the sangha (monastery) to fully practice, but today it is quite “open” globally with many non-Asian adherents (though even Buddhism retains esoteric initiations in Vajrayana/Tantric contexts).

In summary, examples across the world reveal *multiple dimensions* of why a practice might be closed: **sacred secrecy, initiation status, ethnic lineage, doctrinal purity, or cultural survival**. The modern label “closed practice” in online discourse tends to blur some of these distinctions, treating them all under one umbrella of “not for outsiders.” Scholars find this both useful and problematic – useful as a shorthand for talking about **power and permission** in spirituality, but potentially oversimplifying very different scenarios. The Catholic communion example, for instance, is often cited in pagan forums as a “closed practice”[^cite_32](^cite_32), which is true in one sense, though the Church’s reasoning has nothing to do with cultural appropriation. Likewise, someone might argue that if *all* practices requiring initiation are “closed,” then even things like Reiki (which has attunements) or certain forms of Yoga could be considered closed. Clearly, context matters.

## Contemporary Online Discourse and Community Dynamics
The rise of social media platforms dedicated to witchcraft and paganism (Tumblr’s #witchblr, various Discord servers, subreddits like r/witchcraft and r/pagan) has amplified the discussion of closed practices. These online communities have become **key sites for both the promotion and the challenging of the concept**. Ethnographic studies and firsthand accounts indicate that newcomers often learn about closed practices through community guidelines and veteran members. In interviews conducted on the role of online communities for witches, participants noted encountering **strong moral norms** against appropriation. Some experienced users took it upon themselves to correct or even scold those seen using closed practices in ignorance​[^cite_33](^cite_33)[^cite_34](^cite_34). For example, a new witch posting about burning sage might be met with comments explaining the Native context of smudging and suggesting alternative herbs. While this can be educational, researchers have observed it can also veer into **policing and gatekeeping** that *“was generally perceived as off-putting, particularly for those who were new to witchcraft.”*[^cite_35](^cite_35)The zeal to enforce respect for closed practices sometimes turns into what one study participant described as *“moral preaching”* that could alienate newcomers[^cite_36](^cite_36). In a 2022 study of online witch identities (Frampton & Grandison 2023), some interviewees reported witnessing “bullying of newly practicing witches” over issues like using the wrong terminology or inadvertently invoking a closed practice[^cite_37](^cite_37)[^cite_38](^cite_38). Moderators of groups often have to walk a fine line between **allowing discussion** of these issues and preventing flame wars.

There is also a generational or subcultural divide in attitudes. Broadly, the **Tumblr-born discourse** of closed practices has been championed by many younger or more socially progressive practitioners, whereas some older or more traditional occultists bristle at what they see as rigid rules. This tension is evident in online arguments. For instance, on Reddit’s r/occult, one user argued that *“most ‘closed practice’ claims are just veiled racism”* – an expression of frustration that the concept can become too tied to race and ancestry​[^cite_39](^cite_39). He pointed out that historically, religions spread through contact and that *“clinging to long dead traditions”* and keeping them closed might not be practical or necessary[^cite_40](^cite_40). On the other hand, many practitioners of color and their allies emphasize that **power imbalances** in society make these boundaries necessary. A common refrain is that when a dominant-culture person takes on a minority’s sacred practice without permission, it *perpetuates the colonial pattern* of exploitation[^cite_41](^cite_41). In one blog, this is phrased as *“an outsider... gains from their use of practices that are not rightfully theirs, which in effect can recreate imperialistic power structures”*[^cite_42](^cite_42). Online community ethos often leans toward protecting those who have historically been disempowered in spiritual conversations.

Interestingly, some platforms have institutionalized positions on the matter. As noted, **Reddit’s r/witchcraft** decided to consider the sharing of any information that is publicly available (in books or online) as “open,” effectively disallowing users from trying to gatekeep others based on closed practice arguments​[^cite_43](^cite_43). Online community ethos often leans toward protecting those who have historically been disempowered in spiritual conversations.

Interestingly, some platforms have institutionalized positions on the matter. As noted, **Reddit’s r/witchcraft** decided to consider the sharing of any information that is publicly available (in books or online) as “open,” effectively disallowing users from trying to gatekeep others based on closed practice arguments​[^cite_44](^cite_44). This policy was an attempt to reduce infighting. It suggests that while the majority acknowledges closed practices conceptually, *enforcing* that norm in a large, diverse online group can be contentious. Meanwhile, specialized groups – for example, a Discord server specifically for Afro-diasporic religions – may have strict rules reflecting closed status (e.g. only initiates can teach certain things, outsiders should ask permission to observe chats, etc.). Thus, online discourse is not monolithic; it is an evolving negotiation. Scholars following these trends sometimes liken it to earlier phenomena of **internet “flame wars” and norm formation**, but with a new dimension of social justice language.

Despite the debates, the closed practice concept has definitely *shaped behavior* in these communities. Many well-intentioned eclectic practitioners now carefully **vet their practices**: *Is this symbol from a culture I have no connection to?*, *Did I learn this chant from a closed tradition?*, *Do I have the right to use this deity’s name or should I seek a teacher first?* This self-scrutiny is a marked change from, say, the 1990s when a neo-pagan might cheerfully mix Navajo chant with Celtic rites without a second thought. One tangible outcome is the creation of **alternative rituals and vocabularies**, as mentioned earlier. A neopagan might opt for a **“land acknowledgment”** to honor Native peoples rather than appropriating a smudging ritual; or use the term “**smoke cleansing**” instead of “smudging” and choose local herbs to burn​[^cite_45](^cite_45). Another example is crafting new ceremonies inspired by indigenous ones but not copying them – e.g. doing a generic four-directions salute in a Wiccan circle, but *not* using the exact prayers of the Lakota Sun Dance. These adaptations are sometimes shared online as “**culturally respectful alternatives**.” Gottlieb’s research on Tumblr witches found that community members actively developed such alternatives and **“neutralization techniques”** – essentially justifications or modifications to avoid the stigma of appropriation[^cite_46](^cite_46). In her interviews, some pagans described feeling guilty when they discovered a practice they had been doing might be closed, and then taking steps to change their practice or seek proper permission.

## Scholarly Perspectives and Critiques
Academic engagement with the closed practice concept has grown in tandem with its spread in popular discourse. Scholars of contemporary religion, anthropology, and philosophy have approached the issue from several angles:

- **Understanding the Discourse:** Researchers have worked to document *how and why* the closed-practice idea took hold. Kathryn Gottlieb’s 2017 thesis (University of Maine) was an early scholarly work devoted to this, titled *“Cultural Appropriation in Contemporary Neopaganism and Witchcraft.”* She examined **Tumblr discussions** and interviewed practitioners to understand the discourse’s impact​[^cite_47](^cite_47). Her study situates the closed-practice debate in the broader history of modern witchcraft, noting that neopaganism’s eclectic roots were being re-evaluated through a lens of cultural sensitivity. She also noted the development of *“alternative terminologies”* (like saying *“cleansing”* instead of *“smudging”*) as the community’s response to recognizing a practice as closed[^cite_48](^cite_48). This indicates a conscious shift in the community’s identity – an example of what anthropologists call **reflexive self-regulation**: the community is modifying itself based on ethical reflections. Gottlieb’s work treats the topic seriously, validating that *this is a significant conversation that tells us about the evolution of modern Pagan values.*
- **Critical Theory and Power:** Scholars like Sabina Magliocco (a folklorist/anthropologist) and Amy Hale have discussed appropriation and closed practices in terms of **power dynamics and authenticity**. An important point made in academic circles is that cultural appropriation is *not equivalent to mere cultural exchange* – it crucially involves **exploitation and unequal power**[^cite_49](^cite_49). As anthropologist Amy Hale puts it, *“Cultural appropriation is not the same as cultural borrowing. Appropriation involves exploitation and differentials in power relations.”*[^cite_50](^cite_50) In other words, when a majority-culture person adopts a minority culture’s spiritual practice without permission, it’s qualitatively different from two cultures freely sharing with mutual respect. This theoretical framing supports why closed practices *should* be respected in many cases – to avoid reinforcing historic inequalities. Furthermore, some scholars tie this to the concept of **cultural heritage rights**. There is a growing recognition (even in international law, like UNESCO conventions and the U.N. Declaration on Indigenous Rights) that communities have a right to protect and control their intangible cultural heritage, including sacred rituals. The closed practice ethos can be seen as a grassroots reflection of that principle. It is a form of what some philosophers might call **“cultural privacy”** or **“epistemic self-determination”** – the idea that a culture can choose how and with whom its sacred knowledge is shared.
- **Critiques of Essentialism:** On the other hand, scholars have also critiqued the closed-practice discourse when it becomes too rigid or **essentialist**. Amy Hale, for example, while acknowledging the realities of appropriation, warns against an overly zealous focus on cultural purity. *“Cultural artifacts survive and thrive through transmission and contact,”* she notes, and it is acceptable for cultures to exchange in healthy ways​[^cite_51](^cite_51). Hale argues that demanding perfect purity of lineage for every practice is historically untenable – *“perfect unbroken transmission is nearly impossible to find with any cultural expression”*[^cite_52](^cite_52). She cautions that *“focusing on cultural purity and origins leads to disappointment at best and Nazis at worst.”*[^cite_53](^cite_53)This provocative statement highlights the danger of a “bloodline-based” approach: it can slide into the same kind of exclusivist thinking that extremist ethnonationalists use. In scholarly terms, Hale and others critique what they call **reification of culture** – treating cultures as sealed, static entities. Modern anthropological consensus is that cultures are dynamic, and syncretism (the blending of practices) has been a constant in religious history. Therefore, a blanket interdiction on participating in another culture’s practice might ignore contexts where sharing is welcomed or where identities are mixed. Anthropologist Sabina Magliocco has similarly noted that **too narrow a view of authenticity** can be problematic. She observed that some neo-pagans and indigenous groups form alliances and share practices in good faith, complicating the simple open/closed binary[^cite_54](^cite_54). For instance, some Celtic Reconstructionist pagans have respectfully learned from living Celtic folk traditions – is that appropriation or just revival? The answer may depend on perspective.
- **Contested Boundaries – Academic Analysis:** A very recent scholarly contribution is a chapter by Apoorvaa Joshi and Ethel Brooks (2025) entitled *“Whose Craft?: Contentions on Open and Closed Practice in Contemporary Witchcraft(s)”*. This appears in *The Witch Studies Reader* (Duke University Press, 2025) and explicitly tackles the debates around open vs. closed practices. The authors describe **“contested boundaries”** in the witchcraft community, noting that *“one such boundary, and the focus of this chapter, is the discussion around ‘open’ and ‘closed’ practices.”*[^cite_55](^cite_55). While we only have a preview of their work, it’s clear that academic interest has recognized this as a **hot-button issue that encapsulates deeper questions**: who “owns” spiritual knowledge? How do decolonial and feminist perspectives influence modern witchcraft? Preliminary information suggests Joshi and Brooks approach it from a **critical decolonial feminist perspective**, examining how debates on closed practice intersect with issues of race, colonial history, and the self-definition of witches outside Eurocentric narratives[^cite_56](^cite_56)[^cite_57](^cite_57). The very title “Whose Craft?” signals the core question of ownership and belonging. Scholars like them likely argue that the closed-practice discourse is part of a larger **reckoning with colonialism in contemporary Paganism** – an effort to “decenter Europe,” uplift suppressed indigenous voices, and challenge the free-for-all universalist approach that older occultism sometimes took[^cite_58](^cite_58). At the same time, by calling them “contentions,” they acknowledge this is not settled; it’s an evolving negotiation of identity in modern witchcraft.
- **Ethical and Philosophical Debates:** Philosophers of religion and ethicists have also weighed in indirectly by discussing **cultural appropriation ethics**. One debate is how to balance *respect for closed practices* with the values of *individual spiritual freedom*. Western liberal thought generally supports the idea that individuals can explore any religion. Yet, the closed practice idea posits that moral constraints exist on that freedom out of respect for communities. This is a tension between **individualism and collective rights**. Some philosophers argue that if an outsider approaches a tradition humbly, learns the language, even converts or is initiated properly, then morally there is no issue – the practice is no longer “stolen” but rather **shared with consent**. Others note that power imbalances complicate the possibility of genuine consent (e.g., an economically pressured shaman might “share” sacred rituals for money, but is that true consent or coerced by circumstances?). In sum, academic discussions probe questions like: *Can spiritual knowledge be owned?* *Is restricting spiritual practices a form of necessary protection or a problematic gatekeeping?* These remain open questions with thoughtful arguments on both sides.
- **Lived Reality and Complexity:** Ethnographers who study particular communities often find that the reality of how practices are shared or closed is quite nuanced. For example, an anthropologist studying Haitian Vodou might find that *within Haiti*, Vodou priests are proud to initiate foreigners who show respect – hence from their perspective Vodou isn’t “closed” in a racial sense, though it *is* closed in that you must go through the proper initiation. Meanwhile, on the internet, one sees non-Haitians doing pseudo-Vodou spells without initiation – which *is* offensive to the community. Thus the issue is not that outsiders can *never* join, but that they must do so **on the community’s terms**. Scholars like Erin Taylor and Elizabeth Perez (who have studied Afro-Caribbean traditions) emphasize the importance of **relationship and permission**. A practice might be *conditionally open* – if you build a relationship with the culture, you may be welcomed – but it remains *closed to casual appropriation*. This nuance sometimes gets lost in heated online exchanges. Anthropologist Sabina Magliocco has observed that in some cases neo-pagans have responsibly engaged with indigenous teachers and received permission to adapt certain practices, muddying any simplistic categorization of that practice as strictly “closed” or “open.”

In conclusion, the academic framing of closed practices tends to support the **intent** behind the concept – protecting vulnerable cultures from exploitation – while also urging a **critical, nuanced approach**. Scholars often encourage moving beyond slogans to ask: *Who sets the boundaries? How do power and history play in?* They also draw parallels to similar concepts in other domains, such as intellectual property rights, secrecy in ritual, and cultural revival movements. There is a recognition that the closed-practice discourse is *part of a broader decolonization trend* in spirituality. As one commentator noted, the effort to avoid appropriation forces modern Pagans to learn more about the **“cultural & historical context”** of traditions, making them more educated and respectful practitioners overall​[^cite_59](^cite_59)[^cite_60](^cite_60). This educational silver lining is something scholars praise – it pushes practitioners toward genuine intercultural understanding rather than shallow borrowing.

## Conclusion
The concept of “closed practices” in religion has evolved from a niche concern of indigenous activists into a wide-ranging discussion that engages neo-pagan communities, internet subcultures, and academic thinkers. Its **historical roots** lie in legitimate grievances over cultural exploitation – epitomized by the “plastic shaman” backlash and declarations by Native Americans to protect their sacred traditions. From there, neo-pagans (especially in the 2010s) adopted the terminology of *closed vs. open* practices as a way to navigate the ethics of borrowing in a post-colonial world. This framework has since permeated online discourse: on Tumblr dashboards and Discord chats, one finds young witches learning that some practices (like smudging, Hoodoo, or Kabbalah) are *“closed – not for outsiders”*. They also learn that other practices (like Celtic polytheism or Wicca) are more open, or that proper initiation can grant entry across the threshold.

Academically, this phenomenon has been met with both affirmation and critique. **Anthropologists and scholars of religion largely affirm the importance of respecting the wishes of source communities**, noting that cultural appropriation is harmful when it involves power imbalances and disrespect​[^cite_61](^cite_61)[^cite_62](^cite_62). At the same time, they caution against simplistic absolutism. Culture and religion are dynamic; one era’s closed practice may later spread legitimately through cross-cultural exchange (consider Buddhism’s travel from India across Asia, or Yoga’s global diffusion). The challenge, as scholars frame it, is to ensure **mutual respect and consent** guide any adoption of practices. As philosopher James O. Young wrote in a related context, the morality of using another culture’s art or rituals depends on factors like whether the source community consents or is harmed – not merely on the fact of cross-cultural use itself[^cite_63](^cite_63)[^cite_64](^cite_64)
.
From Catholic communion to Yoruba secret societies, we see that restricting spiritual practices is an age-old aspect of human societies – sometimes for internal theological reasons, sometimes as a shield against outside interference. The *modern notion* of a closed practice brings in an additional moral dimension: it asks, *“By partaking in this practice, am I violating someone’s cultural sovereignty or trust?”* This question has undoubtedly made modern Pagans more conscientious. It has sparked intense debates, but also deeper research and self-examination. **Functional restrictions** (like initiation requirements) and **cultural boundaries** (like ethnic lineage) both inform the label, and sometimes lead to overzealous claims (e.g. the erroneous idea that one needs “Celtic blood” to honor Celtic gods, rightly called out as misguided​[^cite_65](^cite_65)). Yet at its best, the closed-practice discourse encourages a kind of **ethical spirituality** – one that strives to practice in a way that is both authentic to oneself *and* respectful toward the cultures one draws from.

In the online world, this discourse continues to develop. We now see community-generated lists of what’s closed, nuanced discussions about specific cases (e.g. *Is Reiki a closed practice since it was once secret in Japan?*; *Can non-Indigenous people participate in Ayahuasca ceremonies if invited?*; etc.), and even some fatigue and backlash in parts of the community. The push and pull will likely continue, but it has unquestionably altered the landscape of contemporary Pagan and New Age practice. A new practitioner in 2025 is far more likely to think twice about burning white sage or calling themselves a shaman than one in 1985 – a testament to the influence of this concept.

From an academic perspective, the conversation around closed practices is valuable because it forces recognition of **historical injustices and the need for cultural humility**. It also raises fascinating questions about the nature of tradition, ownership, and the transmission of knowledge. Scholars will undoubtedly keep studying online pagan forums and real-world communities to see how these ideas play out. As one recent volume on witchcraft studies put it, these debates are part of *“decentering Europe”* and challenging old paradigms in understanding witchcraft and religion​[^cite_66](^cite_66). In plain terms, the closed practice concept is one way marginalized voices are asserting their agency in the spiritual realm – saying *“this is ours, handle with care.”*

Ultimately, most scholars and practitioners can agree on a middle ground principle: **context and respect are everything**. If a practice truly belongs to a living community that considers it closed, outsiders face an ethical mandate to honor that – whether that means abstaining or approaching through proper channels. Conversely, assuming every spiritual element is proprietary can lead to absurd or counterproductive outcomes. The key is ongoing dialogue, education, and empathy. The emergence of the closed practice concept, with all its contentions, has already prompted such dialogue on a wide scale – from academic conferences to coven meetings. It is an evolving example of how modern religious movements grapple with the legacy of colonialism and the meaning of authenticity in an interconnected world.

1. The Risk of practices "becoming" closed practices
With the common idea of "closed practices" often being substantially more respected than the actual beliefs of indigenous and minority religions, this leads to a risk where much like how many of these practices needed to alter their organizations to present themselves as "religions" there is a further risk that they may need to adopt this Judaism inspired model to present themselves as "closed practices" to gain desired treatment even if it goes contrary to their own beliefs.

1. Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah vs. “Closed Practice” Discourse
With Kabbalah discourse 

## Introduction
The mystical tradition of **Kabbalah** has branched into multiple streams over the past five centuries. Notably, **Christian Kabbalah** (often spelled *Cabala*) and **Hermetic Qabalah** developed within Christian and Western esoteric contexts, diverging greatly from their Jewish origins. Today, debates swirl around whether non-Jewish Kabbalistic practices constitute the appropriation of a Jewish *“closed practice.”* This report explores two interrelated issues: **(1)** the historical independence of Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah traditions and how their long evolution complicates claims of them being Jewish “closed practices,” and **(2)** the modern construction of the “closed practice” concept in neo-pagan and online communities, examining its impact on understanding religious traditions. The analysis draws on religious history, philosophy, and anthropology to unpack ideas of tradition ownership, syncretism, and the social dynamics of cultural gatekeeping.

## Part 1: Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah as Divergent Traditions

### Origins and Major Texts of Christian Kabbalah
Christian interest in Kabbalah emerged in the Renaissance. In the late 15th century, scholars like **Giovanni Pico della Mirandola** and **Johannes Reuchlin** pioneered *Christian Kabbalah*, integrating Jewish mystical ideas into a Christian theological framework​[^cite_67](^cite_67)[^cite_68](^cite_68). Pico’s *900 Theses* (1486) included Kabbalistic propositions, and Reuchlin’s seminal works *De verbo mirifico* (1494) and *De arte cabalistica* (1517) adapted Kabbalistic symbolism to affirm Christian doctrines[^cite_69](^cite_69). A core motivation was the belief in a **prisca theologia** – an ancient, universal theology – which allowed Christians to interpret Kabbalah as a primordial truth pointing to Christianity[^cite_70](^cite_70). Early Christian Kabbalists re-read Jewish mystical texts through a Christocentric lens. For example, they linked the ten **Sefirot** (divine emanations) to the Christian Trinity and other dogmas, even re-spelling the Hebrew name of God (YHWH) to include the letter *shin* (yielding *YHSWH*) to reveal the name “Jesus”[^cite_71](^cite_71). Major figures of this era – Pico, Reuchlin, and **Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa** (who incorporated Kabbalah in *De occulta philosophia*, 1510) – treated Kabbalah as a divinely inspired system that, properly decoded, proved Christian truth[^cite_72](^cite_72)[^cite_73](^cite_73).

Christian Kabbalah literature expanded in the 16th–17th centuries. **Athanasius Kircher**, a Jesuit polymath, published Kabbalistic diagrams (e.g. the *Tree of Life*) in *Œdipus Ægyptiacus* (1652), and **Christian Knorr von Rosenroth** compiled *Kabbala Denudata* (1677–84), translating portions of Jewish Kabbalistic texts into Latin. These works were not simply translations; they often included commentary aligning with Christian **angelology** and cosmology​[^cite_74](^cite_74). By the 18th century, however, Christian Kabbalah’s influence waned in theology. As the Enlightenment took hold, Christian Kabbalah survived mostly in occult circles[^cite_75](^cite_75).

**Independence from Jewish Kabbalah:** It is crucial to note that *Christian Kabbalah should be expressly differentiated from Jewish Kabbalah*[^cite_76](^cite_76). From the start, Christian Kabbalists operated largely *outside* the living Jewish tradition, using Jewish sources but reinterpreting them without authorization from Jewish authorities. Their agenda—finding Christ in Kabbalah—was foreign to Judaism, and sometimes explicitly aimed at conversion of Jews[^cite_77](^cite_77)[^cite_78](^cite_78). Thus, although Christian Cabala borrowed Hebrew terms and concepts, it quickly became a self-contained tradition within Christian mysticism. Historian Gershom Scholem observed that these Christian interpretations often amounted to a *“dogmatic weapon”* against Jews[^cite_79](^cite_79), underscoring how divergent the intent and context were from Jewish practice.

### Origins and Major Texts of Hermetic Qabalah
In the 19th century, a revival and transformation occurred within Western esotericism: the rise of **Hermetic Qabalah**. This tradition emerged out of the Renaissance Christian Cabalistic corpus, but was further syncretized with Hermeticism, alchemy, astrology, and magic​[^cite_80](^cite_80). Hermetic Qabalah became the mystical backbone of organizations like the **Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn** (founded 1888) and, later, Aleister Crowley’s **A∴A∴** and the **Ordo Templi Orientis**. Key texts in this lineage include S.L. MacGregor Mathers’ *The Kabbalah Unveiled* (1887), which presented Kabbalistic teachings to an English-speaking occult audience, and **Dion Fortune’s** *The Mystical Qabalah* (1935), a comprehensive handbook linking the Sefirot to Western mystery symbolism[^cite_81](^cite_81). Fortune’s work in particular is considered one of the best introductions to modern Hermetic Qabalah, systematizing the correspondences between the Kabbalistic Tree of Life and Tarot, astrology, and classical elements[^cite_82](^cite_82).

**Hermetic Qabalah** differs from both Jewish and Christian forms by its highly eclectic nature. As one synopsis explains, *“Hermetic Qabalah arose from Christian Cabala… becoming variously esoteric Christian, non-Christian, or anti-Christian across its different schools in the modern era.”* It *“draws on many influences, most notably Jewish Kabbalah, Western astrology, Alchemy, Pagan religions (especially Egyptian and Greco-Roman), Neoplatonism, Hermeticism, and the symbolism of the Tarot.”* In short, Hermetic Qabalah is a *syncretic* system, freely combining elements from disparate traditions​[^cite_83](^cite_83). Its **Tree of Life** diagram – adapted from earlier Kabbalistic sources – became a kind of universal map onto which occultists mapped planets, alchemical processes, and even Jungian archetypes. Importantly, Hermetic Qabalists did not limit themselves to Jewish exegesis; they read Kabbalah as *“universalist ancient wisdom”* rather than as a uniquely Jewish mystical path[^cite_84](^cite_84).

By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Hermetic Qabalah had firmly established itself as an independent pillar of the **Western Mystery Tradition**. Members of the Golden Dawn and its offshoots produced an extensive occult literature that treated the Qabalistic schema as Western esoteric lore. For example, Israel Regardie’s publications on Golden Dawn teachings and Aleister Crowley’s works (*777*, *Sepher Sephiroth*, etc.) integrated Qabalistic terminology while largely divorcing it from Jewish ritual or covenantal context.

### Long-Standing Independence from Judaic Kabbalah
Both Christian Cabala and Hermetic Qabalah have had **centuries of evolution separate from Jewish Kabbalah**. By entering non-Jewish cultural spheres in the Renaissance, these traditions *“developed independently of Judaic Kabbalah, reading the Jewish texts as universalist ancient wisdom… [and](and) adapted the Jewish concepts freely from their Jewish understanding, to merge with multiple other theologies, religious traditions and magical associations.”*[^cite_85](^cite_85). In other words, once Kabbalistic ideas were adopted by Christian mystics and occultists, they underwent interpretive transformation and took on a life of their own. The **syncretic** character of these offshoots meant that over time they incorporated meanings and practices that **no orthodox Jewish Kabbalist would recognize** as their own. For instance, Jewish Kabbalah developed in the 16th century through **Lurianic** theology (with concepts like *Tzimtzum* and *Tikkun*), and later through Hasidic spirituality – developments that largely did not penetrate Christian or Hermetic Kabbalah. Conversely, Hermetic Qabalah’s integration of Tarot cards or Egyptian gods has no basis in Jewish sources; these are distinctly non-Jewish accretions. By the **Age of Reason** (18th century), Christian Cabala had declined, but Hermetic Qabalah persisted as an *“underground tradition in Western esotericism”*, adding layers of occult *“connotations”* to Kabbalah that were *forbidden within Judaism*[^cite_86](^cite_86)(e.g. overt magic and divination).

This long-standing independence raises an intriguing question: Can Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah be considered *Jewish* practices at all, let alone “closed” Jewish practices, given how far removed they are from any Jewish community’s sanction or transmission? From a historical perspective, these currents functioned outside of Jewish communal bounds for hundreds of years. They had their own **lineages** of teaching (e.g. Christian Hebraists teaching other Christian scholars; Golden Dawn initiates teaching their pupils), their own **major texts and commentaries**, and goals often opposed to those of Jewish mystics. In effect, Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah became new traditions *inspired* by Jewish Kabbalah, rather than branches of Judaism. Scholars of religion would classify them under **Western esotericism** or Christian mysticism, not as part of Jewish religious practice​[^cite_87](^cite_87)[^cite_88](^cite_88).

### Syncretism, Appropriation, and Tradition Ownership
The evolution of Christian Cabala and Hermetic Qabalah exemplifies the complex boundary between **syncretism** and **cultural appropriation**. Syncretism refers to blending elements from different traditions to create something new, whereas cultural appropriation involves adopting elements of a culture (often a marginalized one) in a way deemed disrespectful or detached from their original context. Renaissance Christian Kabbalists saw their project as syncretic and even *ecumenical* – an attempt to reconcile religions in a universal theology​[^cite_89](^cite_89). However, from a Jewish standpoint, this “reconciliation” was one-sided and instrumental. Indeed, some historians note a **hegemonic impulse** in Christian Kabbalah: it often treated Judaism as incomplete truth to be fulfilled by Christianity[^cite_90](^cite_90). The power dynamics were evident – Christians (often from a majority culture) were extracting and reinterpreting a minority tradition for their own theological ends. This is a classic scenario of appropriation, albeit one occurring in the 15th–17th centuries rather than in today’s pop culture. A contemporary Jewish writer bluntly states that Kabbalah *“is unquestioningly a closed practice, and cannot be fully understood outside of the context of Judaism. Yet the appropriation of Kabbalah goes back centuries.”*[^cite_91](^cite_91). From this view, Christian and Hermetic adaptations – no matter how old – began as appropriation of Jewish sacred knowledge.

However, the **passage of time and independent evolution** muddle the ethical verdict. Over centuries, Christian and Hermetic Kabbalists developed their own **interpretive communities**, arguably creating distinct mystical systems. By the 20th century, a Hermetic Qabalist learning the Tree of Life from a Golden Dawn manual is inheriting a primarily *Western occult lineage*, not taking teachings directly from living Jewish sages. Does the *origin* of the ideas in medieval Kabbalah still make it a Jewish “closed practice”? Or has it become an **open Western esoteric practice**, albeit one with Jewish roots? Scholars of religion and philosophy of tradition have different perspectives on **“ownership”** of spiritual traditions. Some argue that religious ideas cannot be owned or copyrighted – once knowledge is published or revealed, it enters the realm of humanity’s shared heritage (barring secret rites). Others counter that communities have a right to guard their esoteric knowledge and that using such knowledge out of context can be harmful or sacrilegious. In the case of Kabbalah, Jewish Kabbalists historically imposed restrictions (study reserved for learned Jews above a certain age and piety), effectively treating it as *closed within Judaism*. But they had no mechanism to enforce those norms on Christian scholars. The result was a form of **lineage rupture**: Christian Cabalists learned from Jewish texts but did not become part of the Jewish chain of transmission (they created their own chain). From a **lineage** standpoint, Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah lineages are separate and self-contained.

This independence does not erase the fact that these movements drew on Jewish intellectual property, so to speak. But it does mean that labeling them simply as *Jewish* practices may be inaccurate. They are better seen as **derivative traditions**: related to Judaism historically, yet distinct in practice and authority. The claim that non-Jewish Kabbalah is a “closed Jewish practice” becomes problematic when applied to someone studying Hermetic Qabalah today, because that person is likely engaging with a corpus and community far removed from any Jewish authority. In other words, the *cultural context* has shifted. A parallel might be drawn to **Christianity’s use of the Hebrew Bible**: Christians appropriated Jewish scripture, reinterpreting it as the Old Testament pointing to Christ. While Jews might see that as appropriation of their sacred text, Christianity grew into a separate religion; today a Christian reading Isaiah is not expected to seek Jewish permission – the text and its interpretation have long since entered a *different interpretive universe*. By analogy, one could argue that Hermetic Qabalah has become a *different interpretive universe* for Kabbalistic symbols.

### Retroactive Claims of Appropriation
The issue of **retroactive cultural appropriation** arises when modern sensibilities judge historical interactions. Renaissance Christians did not frame their engagement with Kabbalah in terms of cultural theft – concepts of intellectual property or “closed practice” were not in play; instead, they saw truth as universal (albeit fulfilled in their religion). Likewise, 19th-century occultists saw themselves as *esoteric researchers*, mining all cultures for wisdom. Today, activists might critique those past actions as exploitative or orientalist. Such critiques can be illuminating, but they also struggle with the fact that centuries have passed. The Christian Cabalists and occultists are long dead; their works, for better or worse, contributed to Western esoteric thought. Thus, while a Jewish scholar can point out the *misinterpretations and removal from context* in Christian/Hermetic Kabbalah, it may be impractical to consider those entire traditions illegitimate or off-limits now – they have an identity of their own.

Moreover, contrasts are often made with **more recent appropriations**. For example, the appropriation of Native American ceremonies by New Age practitioners in the last few decades is an *ongoing* concern, where living communities today object to misuse of their rites. In those cases, the **original custodians of the practice are actively resisting appropriation in real time**. By contrast, Jewish reactions to Christian Kabbalah occurred in a very different historical milieu (Jews of the Renaissance had little power to protest in Christian courts, though some did quietly criticize the distortions). In modern times, many Jews are unaware of Hermetic Qabalah unless they encounter it in occult or interfaith contexts; it’s somewhat niche. Thus, while the **principle** of respecting closed practices can be applied (Kabbalah being deeply embedded in Judaism), the *pragmatics* of treating Christian/Hermetic Kabbalah as verboten is tricky. It would entail, for instance, forbidding a non-Jewish occultist from using the *Tree of Life* diagram even if their group has done so for generations. Some Jewish voices indeed advocate that non-Jews desist from Kabbalistic study unless they properly convert or contextualize in Judaism​[^cite_92](^cite_92). On the other hand, philosophical perspectives on syncretism suggest that religious traditions are dynamic – ideas migrate and get transformed. **No tradition is born in a vacuum**; even Jewish Kabbalah itself absorbed Neoplatonic and Gnostic influences in medieval times. Does that make Kabbalah guilty of appropriating earlier pagan philosophy? Most would not frame it that way, because those ideas were thoroughly *naturalized* into the Jewish worldview. Similarly, Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah naturalized Jewish ideas into their worldviews. The ethical evaluation might differ (due to power imbalances and the question of permission), but the mechanism – cross-cultural borrowing – is a historically common one.

In summary, Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah present a complex case where **syncretism and independent development** over centuries make simple labels of “closed practice” difficult to apply. These traditions underscore that once knowledge is transmitted, it can undergo radical reinterpretation. Whether one views this as *illegitimate cultural appropriation* or as the *organic evolution of spiritual ideas* often depends on one’s stance on who “owns” culture and whether sacred knowledge can be universal. The historical reality is that Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah have operated as largely *autonomous traditions* apart from Judaism​[^cite_93](^cite_93). This does not erase their Jewish origin, but it does mean any discussion of them as “Jewish practices” must acknowledge the substantial **distance** (in time, interpretation, and community) from the Jewish context.

## Part 2: Constructing “Closed Practices” and Neo-Pagan Online Dynamics

### “Closed Practices” as a Modern Construct
The term **“closed practice”** has gained currency in recent years, especially in neo-pagan, witchcraft, and online spiritual communities. It denotes a spiritual practice or tradition that is restricted to a certain group – often by **ethnicity, lineage, or initiation status** – and which outsiders should not participate in without permission. Examples commonly cited include Native American ceremonies, African diasporic religions (like Vodou or Ifá), or indeed Judaism and Kabbalah. It is important to recognize that the idea of labeling practices as “closed” or “open” is a product of contemporary discourse. In fact, scholars have noted that the very category of “religion” is itself a modern Western construct that was not universal​[^cite_94](^cite_94). Just as **“religion” had to be defined and invented** in certain contexts (for instance, when Western scholars and colonial administrators tried to classify Asian traditions in the 19th century), the notion of “closed practices” is a **conceptual schema** that has emerged from particular social concerns and conversations, rather than a timeless principle.

Analyses like Jason Josephson-Storm’s *The Invention of Religion in Japan* show that what counts as “a religion” was actively defined in modern times, often for political and comparative purposes​[^cite_95](^cite_95). Similarly, the classification of some practices as **“closed”** can be seen as a **social invention** of late 20th and early 21st-century thought. It arises from heightened awareness of cultural appropriation and the rights of indigenous and marginalized peoples. In academic terms, one might say we are witnessing the *discursive construction* of the category “closed practice.” Anthropologist **Talal Asad** famously argued that even the attempt to define “religion” universally *“is itself the historical product of discursive processes”* tied to Western modernity[^cite_96](^cite_96). By extension, defining what counts as a “closed” versus “open” spiritual practice is a discourse that reflects contemporary values – particularly values of cultural sovereignty, anti-colonialism, and identity politics.

This is not to say that the concept is invalid, but rather that it is *situated*. Different cultures traditionally had their own ways of regulating sacred knowledge (through initiation, taboo, etc.), but the umbrella term “closed practice” packages many disparate customs into a single category governed by modern sensibilities. **Suzanne Owen’s** work on the notion of “indigenous religion” is instructive here. Owen examines how the category “Indigenous Religion” was formulated in scholarly and political arenas, often lumping diverse traditions together for strategic reasons (such as asserting rights or authenticity)​[^cite_97](^cite_97). In one analysis, Owen notes that modern representations of Native American spirituality were frequently romanticized or homogenized with *“little concern for the diversity of Native American opinions.”*[^cite_98](^cite_98)This critique can be applied to “closed practice” rhetoric: by making a blanket rule that a practice is closed, one might ignore internal diversity and debates within that tradition.

### Neo-Pagan and Online Communities’ Use of “Closed Practice”
In neo-pagan and witchcraft communities online (on platforms like Tumblr, TikTok, Reddit, etc.), lists of “closed practices” are often shared as guidelines for ethical spirituality. These lists typically caution against non-initiates using Palo Santo or white sage (indigenous smudging herbs), against laypeople invoking **Orishas** (Yoruba deities) without initiation, against non-Jews doing Kabbalistic ritual, and so on. The intent – coming from a good place – is to encourage respect and prevent culturally insensitive appropriation. However, a striking feature of much of this discourse is a **lack of deep engagement with the specific content or structure of the original traditions**. In other words, the policing is *generic*. A young witch on Tumblr might declare something like, “Vodou is a closed practice, do not do voodoo spells if you’re not initiated.” While this statement has truth (Vodou societies do require initiation for many practices), the person saying it often has not studied Vodou themselves or spoken to a Vodou priest; they are parroting a general rule they’ve heard. The **focus is on the identity of the practitioner** (insider vs outsider) rather than on the nuances of the practice itself.

This phenomenon can flatten the rich complexity of religious traditions. **Blanket categorizations** can indeed *erase internal diversity or dissent* within the source culture. For instance, in reality **not all members of a given community agree** on sharing practices. Some Native American elders have chosen to teach non-Natives (consider the **Native American Church** which has both Native and non-Native members using peyote in a controlled, respectful setting). Some others vehemently oppose any sharing. By labeling the entire sphere “closed” in an online post, those nuances are lost. As Owen pointed out in the Native American context, debates over appropriation often proceed with minimal input from the full range of Native voices​[^cite_99](^cite_99). Similarly, among Jews, there is a spectrum of views on teaching Kabbalah to non-Jews – from stringent opposition to more openness in certain Kabbalistic schools or modern outreach movements. Yet the online narrative may simplistically assert, “Kabbalah is closed: non-Jews *cannot* understand it,” sweeping aside the fact that some Kabbalists historically did interact with non-Jewish seekers. The **diversity within traditions** – based on different theological interpretations, historical circumstances, or personal attitudes – gets obscured when outsiders impose a single label of closed/open.

Another issue is **outsiders policing insiders**. In online forums, one sometimes sees non-members of a culture shushing actual members. For example, a well-meaning pagan might tell a person of Jewish heritage who is sharing Kabbalistic insight, “Be careful, Kabbalah is a closed practice, you shouldn’t share that.” The irony is thick: someone outside the tradition is *overruling or policing an individual from that culture*. There have been cases in neo-pagan spaces where, say, a Native person explained a certain practice and was then lectured by non-Natives about how that practice is closed and they shouldn’t be discussing it publicly. This paternalistic dynamic can be problematic. It raises questions: **Who has the authority to declare a practice closed?** Ideally, one would think the community of origin decides. But online, authority often defaults to whoever projects a morally righteous stance. It leads to what we might call *performative allyship* or *performative indigeneity* – people zealously guarding someone else’s tradition to display their own enlightenment.

### Performative Gatekeeping and Community Governance
The discourse around closed practices in online communities has a strong **performative and normative** element. Declaring something “closed” is not just an informative statement; it’s a signal of the speaker’s values. It says: *“I stand against cultural appropriation. I am a respectful practitioner.”* Sociologically, this functions as a way to establish credibility and moral high ground within the community. There is an element of **community governance**: group moderators and experienced members set rules (“No discussion of smudging, it’s closed unless you’re Indigenous,” or “Don’t use the word ‘spirit animal,’ that’s appropriation”). These rules are then enforced through social sanction (calling out, education, or sometimes dogpiling and shaming). The intentions are often to create a safe and respectful environment, but the *methods and knowledge base* can be shaky.

One observed pattern is that arguments about closed practices are often **shaped more by social-justice theory than by theology or ethnography**. In other words, participants rely on general principles about power and harm rather than detailed knowledge of the practice’s spiritual logic. For instance, few of the online arbiters could explain *why* in Yoruba religion one must be initiated to work with Orishas (the theological reasoning or ritual mechanisms); they just know that allowing uninitiated outsiders has been decried as harmful appropriation of Afro-Caribbean culture. The conversation is framed in terms of *cultural ownership and historical oppression* (“white colonizers took so much, so don’t take this too”) rather than the *internal sacred logic* of the tradition (“certain knowledge is kept esoteric to preserve its power and integrity among initiates”). These social arguments are valid, especially given colonial histories, but they aren’t the full story of the traditions themselves. An ethnographic approach might reveal, for example, that some traditions have protocols for adopting outsiders (many Afro-diasporic religions do allow non-ethnic members if they commit to initiation and the community – which complicates the label “closed” as a binary). A theological approach might consider that some religions actively seek converts (which makes them “open” in intention despite being ethnically rooted, like Buddhism or certain Hindu lineages accepting Westerners). The “closed practice” label, however, tends to present a static picture: you’re either in or out by birth or secret initiation, case closed.

Anthropologists and scholars have critiqued this static view. Notably, the very idea of sharply bounded, homogenous “cultures” is something anthropology has moved away from – cultures are porous and have contested boundaries. The closed practice discourse can paradoxically echo an old anthropological fallacy: treating cultures as monoliths with strict fences. It sometimes ignores **historical change** and **internal debate**. For example, **“Indigenous religion”** as a category often had to be negotiated in international forums (like the United Nations or the AAR) to even be recognized; it’s not that all indigenous peoples naturally thought of themselves as having “religions” – that classification was in part a response to external pressures and the need for a collective voice. Suzanne Owen’s research highlights how groups like British Druids have even tried to claim the label “indigenous religion” to gain legitimacy, which shows how fluid and constructed these labels can be​[^cite_100](^cite_100)[^cite_101](^cite_101). In online neo-pagan contexts, invoking “closed practice” is a way of drawing lines, but those lines may be based on external social narratives more than the **emic** (insider) categories of the traditions.

This is not to say the concern is misplaced – indeed, many traditions **do** have sacred knowledge not meant for casual public use, and appropriation *can* cause real harm or offense. The closed practice norm in online communities serves as a blunt tool to prevent obvious harms (like someone mimicking a Lakota Sundance without any guidance – clearly dangerous and disrespectful). The challenge is that as a blunt tool, it can also **overreach or misfire**. It may label something as off-limits even when the tradition itself might allow a path for outsiders, or it may shut down legitimate intercultural exchange and learning. Furthermore, because the enforcement is social, it can devolve into performance and identity-policing where nuance is lost. In extreme cases, forums become more about *demonstrating one’s anti-colonial credentials* than about genuinely engaging with the richness of different spiritual paths.

### Social vs. Theological Framing of “Closed”
A key observation is that **social-media debates on closed practices are rooted in social ethics** rather than in the theological self-understanding of the religions in question. We see a collision of frameworks: *Social justice activism* meets *religious tradition*. Each has its own language. Activists talk of privilege, power imbalance, oppression, and respect. Practitioners of a tradition might talk of ancestors, purity, initiation vows, or the wrath of spirits when protocols are broken. Sometimes the activist framework and the tradition’s framework align (e.g. both agree outsiders shouldn’t barge in), but other times they misalign. For example, some Afro-diasporic priests may have no political objection to an outsider seeking initiation (they might even welcome the respect shown by doing it properly), yet an outside activist might still criticize a non-black person for adopting an “African” religion, seeing it through a racial lens of appropriation. Here the **social logic (outsider appropriating marginalized culture)** conflicts with the **internal logic (the Orisha accepts devotees regardless of race if they undergo the proper rituals)**. Which logic prevails in online discourse? Often, it’s the social one, because the arbiters are peers on social media rather than authorities from within the tradition.

This dynamic can lead to situations where **individuals from a culture can be “gatekept” by outsiders** who claim to protect that culture. It also leads to a phenomenon where people accumulate a kind of informal social capital by identifying and calling out instances of supposed appropriation. There is performativity in being the one to say “No, that’s closed, you can’t use it,” especially if one doesn’t belong to that group – it shows one’s awareness and allyship. Meanwhile, actual members of the culture might have varied opinions that are not monolithic.

In academic circles, there is growing critique of applying simplistic identity politics to religious practice. Scholars like **Suzanne Owen** and others in the study of indigenous religions caution that we must listen to *insider debates* and avoid treating any tradition as having a single voice. The case of “neo-pagan appropriation of Native American spirituality” has been studied to show both the objections raised by many Native people and the nuanced ways in which some neo-pagans attempt to indigenize their own practices​[^cite_102](^cite_102). The lesson is that issues of appropriation are **context-dependent**. The *history* of relations between the groups, the *power dynamics*, and the *sacred meanings* all matter. Online “closed practice” discourse sometimes reduces this to a checklist – which, while easy to follow, might bypass context.

To tie back to Part 1 with an example: In online communities, one often sees Judaism and Kabbalah listed as closed. Judaism is indeed not a proselytizing religion and has barriers to conversion (one must formally convert to be considered Jewish). Kabbalah, as traditionally taught, required being an observant Jew well-versed in Torah/Talmud, etc. So on the face of it, calling it closed is aligning with those facts. Yet, the **history of Christian and Hermetic Kabbalah** complicates this, as we discussed. The online community, in many cases, is *not aware of that history in detail* – they enforce the closed label without acknowledging that *the horse has long left the barn*, so to speak, with Kabbalah ideas permeating Western esotericism. Indeed, you might encounter neo-pagans who simultaneously say “Kabbalah is closed, don’t use it,” and then in another breath talk about their favorite Tarot spread (oblivious that Tarot’s incorporation of the Tree of Life is itself a product of Hermetic Qabalah). This highlights a certain *incoherence born of superficial knowledge*: the content of the practice (like occult Tarot reading) has Kabbalistic elements, but the policing happens at the level of labels (“don’t use Hebrew godnames, that’s closed”). The discourse is driven by *social awareness* (do’s and don’ts gleaned from community norms) rather than a holistic understanding of how these symbols have traveled.

### Constructive Paths Forward
Anthropological critiques of religious classification urge us to approach these matters with nuance and respect for actual practitioners. Instead of relying solely on broad labels, engaging with the **lineages, permissions, and transformations** of a practice can be more fruitful. For neo-pagan communities, this might mean encouraging research and perhaps dialogue with members of the source traditions. It also means accepting complexity: for example, understanding that **syncretism** has been a driving force in religious history (not always a nefarious one) and that **borrowing can occur alongside respect**. The difference between harmful appropriation and creative syncretism often lies in *consent, context, and the power balance*. When Aleister Crowley, a British occultist, took Jewish, Egyptian, and Hindu concepts and mixed them, he was participating in a long Western esoteric habit of seeing the world’s traditions as a smörgåsbord of symbols – a very *colonial* approach in hindsight, assuming everything is there for the taking. Today’s practitioners are trying to be more conscientious, which is commendable. The challenge is doing so in an informed, rather than performative, way.

Suzanne Owen’s examination of how “indigenous religion” is defined suggests the need for reflexivity – understanding that our categories (be it “religion” or “closed”) are shaped by our contemporary interests​[^cite_103](^cite_103). The concept of **“ownership” of traditions** is itself debated in philosophy. Some argue that spiritual knowledge is not a commodity and framing it in terms of ownership might inadvertently impose a modern property-based model on something that traditionally was governed by other logics (like kinship or initiatory lineage). Others rightly point out that in a world of unequal power, *not* talking about ownership allows dominant groups to continue exploitative behavior unchecked. Thus, there is a tension between universalist and particularist views of spiritual culture.

In the end, what becomes clear is that **dialogue and education** are preferable to fiat declarations. If one is drawn to a practice that might be “closed,” the respectful approach is to learn *why* it is considered closed, and if appropriate, seek legitimate pathways (such as formal conversion or apprenticeship) or else choose a different path. For those doing the policing in communities, a more informed approach would involve citing voices from within the tradition (for example, if saying something is closed, perhaps link to a Native person explaining why their ceremony is not for outsiders). This makes the conversation more grounded in the **actual community’s stance** rather than an abstract rule.

The discourse on closed practices, much like the academic discourse on “what counts as religion,” is evolving. It reflects a larger societal attempt to balance **respect for cultural diversity** with the reality of **global interconnectedness**. Religions have always interacted and sometimes collided – the current generation is wrestling with how to do so ethically. By understanding the history of cross-cultural interactions (like the case of Kabbalah’s journey through Christian and occult hands) and by critically examining our own categories, we can hopefully avoid both the naivety of uncritical borrowing and the rigidity of uninformed gatekeeping. The goal should be to honor the **lineage and living stakeholders** of any spiritual practice, while also acknowledging the shared human curiosity that has always led people to seek wisdom beyond the bounds of their birth culture.

## Conclusion
**Christian Kabbalah and Hermetic Qabalah** demonstrate that religious traditions can, over time, branch off and establish themselves as independent systems, even when they originated in a closed or context-specific practice. Their centuries-long divergence from Jewish Kabbalah complicates simple claims of ownership: they are rooted in Jewish mysticism yet are not synonymous with it. This historical perspective urges caution in retroactively applying modern labels like “closed practice” without nuance. It illustrates that **syncretism and reinterpretation** – however controversial – have been part of religious history, raising questions about how we define a tradition’s boundaries and who has the authority to do so.

**The modern idea of “closed practices,”** as used in neo-pagan and online circles, is a well-intentioned construct aimed at preventing exploitation of marginalized spiritual traditions. However, as a construct, it has inherent limitations. It tends to simplify complex traditions and can inadvertently silence the very voices it seeks to protect by imposing external consensus over internal debate. The analysis here suggests that while respecting closed practices is important, one must also critically assess how those closures are defined and by whom. The **performative aspect** of online closed-practice discourse highlights that these debates often serve social and community-regulatory functions. They are as much about signalling group values and enforcing norms as about the traditions themselves.

By incorporating insights from religious studies and anthropology, we see that concepts like “religion” or “indigenous tradition” have always been negotiated and *invented* to some extent​[^cite_104](^cite_104)[^cite_105](^cite_105)
. “Closed practice” is no different. It is a category we are in the process of inventing and refining. The challenge and opportunity moving forward is to ground this category in genuine **dialogue with source communities** and careful understanding of each tradition’s nature. Rather than blanket proclamations, a case-by-case approach that considers **history, power relations, and the voices of practitioners** will yield better ethical guidance.

In sum, the intersection of Kabbalah’s multi-religious history with today’s identity-conscious spirituality discourse teaches us that **ownership of tradition is not a straightforward matter**. It involves lineage, context, and consent. Respecting a tradition means not only keeping out when required, but also truly appreciating its depth and listening to those who carry it. As we navigate a pluralistic world, both the borrowers and the gatekeepers have much to learn from each other. The hope is for a respectful engagement that honors the sacred while fostering mutual understanding – a balance between guarding what must be cherished and recognizing the shared human quest that underlies all spiritual seeking.
