# Japan Chapter

Great, I’ll begin an in-depth research task focusing on the development and transformation of Shinto from its early origins through the Meiji era, with particular attention to the classical and Heian periods. This will explore how Japan sustained religious pluralism and resisted monotheistic overcoding, with emphasis on the institutional role of the Jingikan, integration with Buddhism, and ideological frameworks like Confucian ritual governance.

I’ll let you know as soon as the research is ready for review.

1. Shinto’s Evolution and Religious Pluralism in Japan: Historical Development and Institutions

## Polytheistic Foundations in the Yayoi and Kofun Periods

Early Japanese religious practice was inherently **polytheistic and local** in character, laying a foundation for enduring pluralism. During the **Yayoi period (c. 400 BCE–300 CE)**, agrarian communities conducted nature-centric rituals at sacred sites such as large rocks, waterfalls, and groves, inviting formless **kami** (spirits/deities) to descend into physical objects (＊yorishiro＊) like trees, stones, or even mountains [^cite_1](^cite_1). Kami in this era were not all-powerful creators but **natural forces** tied to phenomena (e.g. rain, fertility) – capricious and potentially dangerous if angered [^cite_2](^cite_2).  Rituals were thus largely propitiatory: village chiefs led ceremonies to **placate and beseech multiple kami** for good harvests and community well-being. These chiefs often doubled as shamans or priests, blurring secular and sacred roles [^cite_3](^cite_3).  Crucially, there was no notion of one exclusive god; rather, **many kami and ancestral spirits** coexisted, each rooted in a specific locale or clan.

By the **Kofun period (c. 300–700 CE)**, the reverence for ancestors and clan deities became more pronounced. Rulers and elite lineages constructed massive burial mounds (*kofun*) for deceased leaders, surrounded by clay figurines (*haniwa*) depicting warriors, servants, and houses – indicating a belief in an afterlife where ancestral spirits required sustenance and protection [^cite_4](^cite_4) [^cite_5](^cite_5). The imperial Yamato clan’s mythology, later recorded in the *Kojiki* (712) and *Nihon Shoki* (720), traced the emperor’s lineage to the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, elevating an **ancestor-kami** to a supreme position without denying the existence of myriad other kami [^cite_6](^cite_6) [^cite_7](^cite_7). As historian Kuroda Toshio notes, **kami were originally local deities** tied to clans or communities (often identified with ancestral spirits), which only later became linked to a wider imperial state concept [^cite_8](^cite_8). In short, Japan’s earliest religious strata featured **multiple centers of devotion** – nature spirits, clan tutelaries, and ancestral souls – fostering a **resilient polytheistic outlook** that would accommodate new religions rather than be replaced by them.

Importantly, even as the Yamato state expanded, it largely **incorporated local cults** rather than suppressing them. By the late Kofun era, the Yamato court began efforts to **coordinate regional kami worship** across its growing territory: for example, Emperor **Keitai** (r. 507–531) initiated a policy of dispatching court ritualists (the *Hioki-be* specialists) to provincial shrines to harmonize their rites with those of the capital [^cite_9](^cite_9). This early central patronage helped integrate diverse local rites into a loose network under imperial auspices. Yet, crucially, it did not extinguish the **decentralized autonomy** of local rituals – village and clan ceremonies continued as before, now just acknowledged and sometimes patronized by the court. The result by the end of the Kofun period was a nascent ritual hierarchy (with the Yamato sun cult at the apex) coexisting with persistent **plural local traditions**. This pattern – central coordination without outright religious unification – set the stage for Japan’s distinctive pluralism: even as more organized institutions emerged, they built upon a mosaic of **many gods (八百万の神, *yaoyorozu no kami*, “eight million kami”)** rather than enforcing a single orthodoxy.

## The Jingikan and Centralized Ritual Order in the Classical Era

In the early **Classical period (7th–9th centuries)**, the Japanese state undertook a remarkable bureaucratic project to **centralize and systematize religious rites** – without abolishing the fundamental polytheism of kami worship. Under the **Ritsuryō legal system** imported from Tang China (first codified 701 CE), a government office called the **Jingikan** (神祇官, “Department/Council of Divinities”) was established. The Jingikan was one of two top state councils (the other being the Dajōkan or Council of State) and was theoretically supreme in rank [^cite_10](^cite_10) [^cite_11](^cite_11). Its mandate was unprecedented – as historian Helen Hardacre observes, the creation of the Jingikan under the Ritsuryō code represents *“the institutional origin of Shinto”* as a central organized tradition [^cite_12](^cite_12). Notably, nothing exactly like the Jingikan existed in China; Japan’s leaders **invented a unique state apparatus for kami worship** [^cite_13](^cite_13). The Jingikan’s charge was to ensure that **official rituals to honor the kami** (the indigenous deities of heaven and earth) were performed throughout the realm according to law [^cite_14](^cite_14). To this end, a regulatory code known as the **Jingiryō** (“Kami Law”) was compiled, listing 20 annual festivals and ceremonies to be conducted for the **peace and prosperity of the realm** [^cite_15](^cite_15). These included offerings at major shrines, harvest festivals (*Niiname-sai*), purification rites, and others – effectively a **central ritual calendar** binding court and provinces [^cite_16](^cite_16) [^cite_17](^cite_17). The Jingikan thus provided a framework for a **state-wide ritual order** centered on the emperor’s court.

At the same time, the **decentralized shrine network** remained intact under this system. The Jingikan did not usurp local priestly lineages or enforce doctrinal uniformity; rather, it supervised and coordinated. For example, the *Engishiki* (927 CE), a compendium of regulations and ritual protocols, enumerated thousands of local shrines eligible for imperial offerings, implicitly recognizing the **proliferation of sacred sites and kami cults** across the provinces. Each shrine maintained its own traditions and **hereditary priests (神官, *shinkan*)**, while the Jingikan set standards and courtiers ritually affirmed the hierarchy by sending offerings [^cite_18](^cite_18) [^cite_19](^cite_19). The **Department of Divinities acted as a hub** linking the imperial center with the mosaic of local cults. Indeed, formal law gave the Jingikan nominal precedence even over the Council of State, underscoring how seriously the early Japanese state took ritual governance [^cite_20](^cite_20) [^cite_21](^cite_21). In practice, however, the Jingikan was **subordinate to imperial edicts** channeled through the secular government [^cite_22](^cite_22). This meant it functioned less as an independent “church” and more as a state ministry ensuring that **no kami were neglected in official rites**.

The establishment of the Jingikan marked a new level of **institutional integration** for Shinto (even though the term *“Shinto”* itself was not yet in common use for an independent religion). It allowed the Yamato house to **legitimize its rule via divine sanction** – the emperor was now the pivot of both government and worship, performing grand ceremonies (like the thanksgiving **Niiname** harvest rite) as a kind of priest-king. The classical chronicles record emperors consulting oracles and dedicating state resources to shrines, which reflects this fused model of sacral kingship [^cite_23](^cite_23) [^cite_24](^cite_24). Notably, the 8th-century mythohistories (*Kojiki* and *Nihon Shoki*) themselves were commissioned by the court *“to legitimize and consolidate their rule”* through kami narratives [^cite_25](^cite_25) [^cite_26](^cite_26). In this sense, an **ideological centralization** occurred: the Sun Goddess myth and the Jingikan system together projected an image of a **unified ritual order** under imperial auspices.

Yet this centralization did **not eliminate religious pluralism**; rather, it managed it. The autonomy of local shrines was largely preserved – the state’s role was to patronize and regulate, not to homogenize spiritual practice. By the mid-Heian period (10th–11th centuries), the limitations of central control became evident: the Jingikan’s **ability to supervise distant shrines waned markedly** [^cite_27](^cite_27). According to Hardacre, by the 900s provincial shrine priests often **ignored or bypassed** the Jingikan’s directives [^cite_28](^cite_28). Emperors and aristocrats began developing **private or court-specific cults** (such as personal patronage of certain shrines), expanding the ritual calendar with new ceremonies (e.g. rites to pacify **vengeful spirits** of the war dead, or *goryō-e*) that were outside the old Jingiryō prescriptions [^cite_29](^cite_29). In other words, the **formal centralized ritual order “declined conspicuously”** in influence, while **decentralized and innovative practices flourished** [^cite_30](^cite_30). This demonstrates a key theme: even with a central department of religion, Japan maintained a **plural and flexible religious landscape**. Unlike a theocracy imposing one dogma, the classical state cultivated a broad umbrella of rites – **imperial Shinto – under which myriad local cults coexisted**. As Hardacre notes, **Shinto’s institutional identity** coalesced around the Jingikan and court rites, but it never became an exclusive state church in the Western sense [^cite_31](^cite_31) [^cite_32](^cite_32). Indeed, the very **absence of a singular orthodoxy** at this stage helped Shinto institutions endure alongside incoming faiths, rather than being subsumed by them.

## Buddhist–Shintō Syncretism (神仏習合): Honji Suijaku and Pluralism without Orthodoxy

One of the most distinctive features of Japanese religious history is the **syncretism of Buddhism and Shintō**, known as *Shinbutsu-shūgō* (神仏習合, “kami–Buddha fusion). After Buddhism entered Japan in the 6th century, it did not displace the worship of kami; instead, over centuries, the two systems became deeply intertwined. By the **Heian period (8th–12th centuries)**, Japanese thought had developed the doctrine of **本地垂迹 (*honji suijaku*)**, literally “original ground and manifest trace.” This doctrine held that the **Buddhas and bodhisattvas** of Buddhism are the ultimate reality (the *honji*, “original ground”), while the **kami** are merely their local manifestations (*suijaku*, “traces”) appearing in Japan [^cite_33](^cite_33) [^cite_34](^cite_34). In practice, this meant every major kami could be understood as an avatar of a Buddha or bodhisattva – for example, the sun goddess Amaterasu was linked to Dainichi (the cosmic Buddha), and the storm god Susanoo linked to a Buddhist deity. Far from producing religious conflict, this idea facilitated **Buddhist-Shintō unity**: rather than choosing one faith over the other, people saw them as *two levels of a single truth*. 

From roughly the late 8th through 11th centuries, **kami veneration was increasingly absorbed into the Buddhist worldview** [^cite_35](^cite_35). Japanese Buddhist monks and scholars articulated several explanations to integrate the myriad native gods: 

- **Kami as Buddhist seekers:** Some taught that the kami themselves, realizing they were trapped in the cycle of rebirth (*samsara*), sought salvation through the Buddha’s law [^cite_36](^cite_36).  
- **Kami as protectors of Buddhism:** Another view held that the kami were benevolent guardians who **defend the Buddhist Dharma**, accepting their role in service of the Buddha [^cite_37](^cite_37).  
- **Kami as emanations of Buddhas (honji suijaku):** The most enduring doctrine asserted that each kami is a **local manifestation** of a particular Buddha or bodhisattva, sent to guide the Japanese – the *honji suijaku* theory [^cite_38](^cite_38) [^cite_39](^cite_39).  
- **Kami as spirits of Buddhas (＊hongaku＊):** In some esoteric interpretations, the kami were even seen as the pure, enlightened **spirit essences of the Buddhas**, identical in their ultimate nature [^cite_40](^cite_40).

Alongside these doctrines, **new religious institutions** embodied the fusion. Buddhist temples were built *adjacent to Shintō shrines*, creating combined complexes known as **神宮寺 (*jingūji*, “shrine-temples”)**. The first jingūji appeared by the late 7th century; by the Heian era many important shrines (Ise being a rare exception) had a temple attached, staffed by Buddhist monks who conducted rites in tandem with—or often in control of—the shrine [^cite_41](^cite_41) [^cite_42](^cite_42). A famous example is the **Usa Hachiman Shrine**, where by the 8th century the kami Hachiman was revered as a **Bodhisattva** and a temple stood on the shrine grounds. In many cases, the **Buddhist clergy assumed the leadership** at shrines, overseeing kami rituals through a Buddhist lens [^cite_43](^cite_43) [^cite_44](^cite_44). Images of kami were even cast in Buddhist style or depicted in **mandala** form (e.g. the Sannō Shrine mandala of Hie shrine shows Shintō deities in Buddhist iconography). This syncretic environment was so pervasive that it became **impossible to neatly separate “Shintō” from “Buddhism”** in medieval Japan [^cite_45](^cite_45). Ritual and iconography blended: for instance, the kami Hachiman was classically portrayed as a Buddhist monk (*Sogyo Hachiman*), and shrine festivals incorporated Buddhist sutra-chanting, while temples enshrined kami as guardians [^cite_46](^cite_46). As a result, religious sites and practices were **dual-faith by default** – one and the same institution would have Shintō ceremonies and Buddhist liturgies, serving both kami and Buddhas.

Significantly, this syncretism meant Japan **never experienced the rigid enforcement of an exclusive orthodoxy**. There was no drive to declare one creed true and others false. On the contrary, the logic was **inclusivist**: **all deities could be accommodated** in a single cosmology. We see this in the way medieval thinkers handled contradictions. If a kami seemed violent or unholy, it was explained as a **manifestation of a wrathful Buddhist deity** or as a **deluded spirit in need of Buddhist enlightenment**, rather than as a rival god to be overthrown [^cite_47](^cite_47) [^cite_48](^cite_48). The upshot was that **religious pluralism became doctrinally entrenched** – Buddhism provided an expansive philosophical umbrella that **validated the existence of countless local deities**. Kuroda Toshio emphasizes that in this period, *“there was more of a sense that Shintō occupied a subordinate position and role within the broader scheme of Buddhism”* [^cite_49](^cite_49). In other words, kami worship did not exist as an independent, self-contained “religion” but as part of a **combinatory religious system** dominated by Buddhist theory. Shintō (understood as the way of the kami) had no separate scriptures or exclusive institutions of its own, and thus **no separate dogma to enforce**. 

This lack of a singular orthodoxy is exemplified by the absence of even a term strictly meaning “Shintō” for much of this time – the word *Shintō* (神道, “Way of the Gods”) was used in various senses but often simply meant Buddhist-observances-for-kami or the general divine aspect of Japan [^cite_50](^cite_50). The fusion was so complete that it wasn’t obvious to people that there were two “religions” at all; they saw a continuum of practices addressing different spiritual needs. **Shrine priests and Buddhist monks cooperated**: for instance, at the major shrine of Kasuga in Nara, the powerful Kōfukuji temple (of the Fujiwara clan) managed the shrine, and Kasuga’s kami were viewed as incarnations of Kōfukuji’s Buddhist deities [^cite_51](^cite_51). **No one was forced to choose** between attending a shrine or a temple – most individuals freely did both. This is a key contrast with cultures that adopted a universalist religion which demanded *exclusive* allegiance. In Japan, **multiple religious loyalties were the norm**, not an aberration.

By the late medieval period (14th–16th centuries), some intellectuals (notably in the **Yoshida Shintō** school) began to push back, proposing that **kami were the true originals and Buddhas their manifestations** (an *inverted* honji suijaku), in an effort to elevate Shintō’s status [^cite_52](^cite_52). However, these ideas remained theoretical and did not disrupt the prevailing syncretism at the popular level. It was only in the **Meiji Restoration of 1868** that a sudden, state-imposed separation of Buddhism and Shintō (*shinbutsu bunri*) took place – an unprecedented attempt to **disentangle the blended faiths** after over a millennium of union [^cite_53](^cite_53). Notably, Kuroda argues that this Meiji-era policy (and the associated brief persecution of Buddhism, *haibutsu kishaku*) was essentially the moment Shintō *“achieved for the first time the status of an independent religion”* – albeit artificially, by government fiat [^cite_54](^cite_54). In other words, prior to modern reforms, Japan had resisted creating a standalone, exclusivist state religion. Instead, its religious institutions evolved in **pluralistic tandem**, with Buddhism and kami-worship *intertwined* rather than competing. This long syncretic experience meant that **universalist or monotheistic “overcoding” never gained a foothold**: any external religion (like Buddhism, and later Christianity) had to coexist with the entrenched kami cult, which itself proved remarkably adaptable. The result was a deeply plural religious culture in which **“mixing” was the rule** – a stark contrast to regions where one religion supplanted all others.

## Confucian Influence and Ritual Governance in Heian and Edo Periods

Beyond Buddhism, **Confucianism** was the third major component of the Japanese religious matrix, especially influencing ideas of governance and social order. Confucian thought – with its emphasis on ritual propriety (礼, *rei*), filial piety, and moral hierarchy – entered Japan alongside other aspects of Chinese civilization. By the **Heian period (794–1185)**, Confucian ideals had been incorporated into court politics and education. For instance, Japan’s early legal codes and imperial edicts show a Confucian imprint: Prince Shōtoku’s 7th-century “Seventeen-Article Constitution” famously enjoined officials to *“sincerely revere the Three Treasures [Buddhism](Buddhism)”* in one article, but elsewhere it stressed **harmonious rule and ethical behavior** in line with Confucian virtues [^cite_55](^cite_55) [^cite_56](^cite_56). The **ritsuryō state** itself was built on Chinese models that presumed a Confucian cosmological order. As Kuroda notes, the Jingiryō (kami law) section of the Ritsuryō code existed parallel to (and just before) the **Sōniryō (Monastic Law)** section governing Buddhist clergy – implying that the state saw **kami rites and Buddhist institutions as distinct but complementary** spheres [^cite_57](^cite_57) [^cite_58](^cite_58). This separation in law between kami ceremonies and “doctrinal” religions like Buddhism reflects a Confucian-influenced logic: the kami rites were part of **state ritual (祭祀)** and social obligation, whereas Buddhism was a matter of personal belief and higher teachings [^cite_59](^cite_59) [^cite_60](^cite_60). Thus, already in the classical era, one can see an anticipation of the later idea that Shintō was about **ritual and custom** more than doctrine – a notion compatible with Confucian views of religion as civic rites upholding the social order.

During the **Heian period**, Confucianism worked mostly in the background as a *political philosophy and ethical guide*. Court scholars studied Chinese classics; emperors held ceremonies (such as the **Enshrinement of Confucius** at the State Academy) to honor learning. However, Confucianism did not become a mass religion – it had **no priesthood or temples of its own** (apart from a few Confucian shrines later). Instead, its influence was to **sacralize governance**: the emperor was cast as a **Mandate-of-Heaven style ruler** who performed correct rites, and officials were idealized as upright Confucian gentlemen. This **ritual ideology** reinforced Shintō and Buddhist practices rather than replacing them. For example, the concept of **天下 (*tenka*, “All Under Heaven”)** and a harmonious cosmic order informed how court ceremonies (like seasonal festivals or ancestral rites) were conducted, ensuring they paralleled the Chinese ideal of **Li (ritual propriety)**. By the late Heian, some Shintō theologians (such as at Ise Shrine) were even interpreting Japan’s kami mythology in light of Confucian cosmology and ethics [^cite_61](^cite_61) [^cite_62](^cite_62). *Nihon Shoki* commentaries by scholars like Ichijō Kaneyoshi (15th c.) and *Ise Shintō* texts by Watarai priests drew on **Neo-Confucian concepts** (e.g. yin-yang theory and moral principles) to explain the workings of the kami [^cite_63](^cite_63) [^cite_64](^cite_64). This shows that **Confucianism had been absorbed into the syncretic mix**, further **blurring any notion of exclusive religion** – Shintō, Buddhism, and Confucianism were seen by medieval scholars as different facets of a single overarching truth [^cite_65](^cite_65).

It was in the **Edo period (1600–1868)**, under the Tokugawa shogunate, that Confucianism rose to its peak influence as a **state ideology**. Tokugawa rulers, seeking stability after centuries of war, promoted **Neo-Confucianism (especially the Zhu Xi school)** as the official philosophy guiding government and society [^cite_66](^cite_66) [^cite_67](^cite_67). **Confucian ethics** – loyalty to one’s lord, filial piety in the family, respect for social harmony – were actively disseminated. The shogunate established a Confucian academy (*Shōheikō*) in Edo, and domain lords set up similar schools, elevating Confucian learning to prestige [^cite_68](^cite_68) [^cite_69](^cite_69). Importantly, the Tokugawa embraced Confucianism *alongside* existing religious practices. Rather than proclaiming an exclusive “Confucian religion,” they invoked it to bolster **Buddhism and Shintō as instruments of governance** [^cite_70](^cite_70). The government required every household to register with a Buddhist temple (the **danka system**) mainly to root out Christians, effectively using Buddhism as a social registry, while supporting shrine rites as part of communal life. Tokugawa intellectuals often spoke of the **unity of the Three Teachings (＊sankyō itchi＊)** – Shintō, Buddhism, and Confucianism as fundamentally harmonious and complementary [^cite_71](^cite_71). A popular slogan was **神儒仏三教一致 (*Shinju butsu sankyō itchi*)**, meaning “Shintō, Confucianism, and Buddhism [are](are) one.” In fact, early Edo Confucian scholars like **Hayashi Razan** and **Yamazaki Ansai** developed what was called **“Confucian Shintō” (儒家神道, *Juka Shintō*)**, asserting that Shintō’s ethical teachings were basically the same as Confucian morality, and that the ancient kami worship embodied Confucian principles of loyalty and filial piety [^cite_72](^cite_72) [^cite_73](^cite_73). They even reinterpreted Shintō texts through a Neo-Confucian lens, showing the flexibility of Shintō ideology to absorb foreign philosophies.

During the Edo era, therefore, **Confucianism shaped Japanese religious life in a broad sense** – by providing a **moral and rational discourse** that framed how people understood their obligations to family, lord, and community. It reinforced **ritual order** (e.g. emphasis on ancestral rites, which resonated with both Shintō and Buddhist practices) and gave the samurai governing class a **quasi-secular creed**. Yet notably, this did not lead to a monolithic religious structure. If anything, Confucian rationalism sometimes criticized superstitions, but it **never displaced shrine or temple traditions**. Instead, the shogunate’s approach was pluralistic: **Buddhism was maintained as the spiritual pillar** (with every family affiliated to a temple), **Shintō shrines continued their festivals** under domain patronage, and **Confucianism provided ethical training and civil ideology** [^cite_74](^cite_74) [^cite_75](^cite_75). The system succeeded in keeping Christianity – a potentially exclusivist, universal religion – at bay, but it did so by **buttressing indigenous pluralism** rather than by converting the populace to one new faith. As one historian notes, *“the Tokugawa saw the value of Confucian teachings **along with Buddhism and Shintō** in their effort to establish a lasting peace”* [^cite_76](^cite_76). This triumvirate approach meant **no single doctrine ruled uncontested**. 

Indeed, Japan’s resistance to exclusive religion is highlighted by the fate of **Christianity** in the Edo period. After an initial period of mission activity (1549–1630s) had won converts, the Tokugawa shoguns banned Christianity precisely because it demanded exclusive loyalty to one God, which authorities perceived as subversive. One reason often given is that **Christian monotheism’s insistence on sole worship ran counter to Japanese habits** of multiple religious belonging [^cite_77](^cite_77). As an analysis from Stanford notes, *“Christianity’s demand for exclusive allegiance… stood in sharp contrast to the more inclusive approach of the Japanese”* [^cite_78](^cite_78). This encapsulates how deeply pluralism was embedded: both the rulers and the people were accustomed to the idea that one could venerate **many gods and buddhas, and follow several paths simultaneously**, without contradiction. Tokugawa policy, therefore, enforced a kind of **religious pluralism as law**: everyone should be Buddhist (at least nominally, to prove they weren’t Christian), and they were free to also engage in Shintō and folk practices – just not exclusive monotheism. Meanwhile, **Confucian ideals permeated education and governance**, but as a **secular moral philosophy**, not a congregational religion. Even movements that edged toward monotheistic style devotion, such as the monotheistic leanings in some **Neo-Confucian Shintō sects** (e.g. teachings that venerating Amaterasu or “one deity” could be the essence), never claimed sole truth for all Japanese; they operated within the ecumenical environment of the time.

By the end of the Edo period, Japanese intellectual life was a rich blend: **scholars of National Learning (Kokugaku)** were re-examining Shintō classics and sometimes arguing for the primacy of native kami, Confucian scholars were laying the ethical groundwork for modern reforms, and **Buddhist institutions remained deeply enmeshed in community life** (funerals, memorials, parish system). Robert Bellah observed that Tokugawa Japan had a sort of **“civil religion”** – a set of shared values and rituals (loyalty, harmony, reverence for the emperor and nation) that drew on Shintō and Confucian symbolism, which helped unite society without a singular church or creed. Thus, Japan on the eve of the modern era was highly *religious* in practice but did not define “religion” as a singular exclusive identity. **Multiple layers of belief coexisted**: one could visit a shrine, chant sutras, and read Confucian ethics all in one day. This inherent pluralism would be challenged – but not erased – by the revolutionary changes of the Meiji Restoration.

## The Meiji Restoration and the Invention of “Religion” (Shūkyō) in Japan

The Meiji Restoration of 1868 brought about a dramatic reordering of Japan’s religious landscape, yet even this was done in a way that *preserved religious pluralism* under new categories. When Japan opened to the West in the mid-19th century, it encountered the Western concept of “religion” (*shūkyō* 宗教) as a defined, private sphere of belief – a concept that **had not existed in Japan in the same way** [^cite_79](^cite_79). As Jason Josephson Storm documents in *The Invention of Religion in Japan*, Japanese officials were forced to **grapple with the Western idea of “religion”** after U.S. Commodore Perry’s arrival (1853) and the ensuing treaties that demanded “freedom of religion” in Japan [^cite_80](^cite_80) [^cite_81](^cite_81). Prior to this, Japan had no single word that mapped to the Western notion of religion as distinct from state or culture; the closest were terms for specific sects or teachings (like Bukkyō for Buddhism). The Meiji state’s response was essentially to **invent new distinctions** to satisfy Western expectations while still maintaining Japan’s own civilizational ethos [^cite_82](^cite_82) [^cite_83](^cite_83).

In the 1868–1870s, the Meiji government promulgated policies of **“Separating Kami and Buddhas” (神仏分離, *shinbutsu bunri*)**. This involved legally disentangling Shintō shrines from Buddhist temples – priests had to choose whether they would be shrine priests or Buddhist clerics, Buddhist imagery was stripped from shrines, and for a short period a **violent anti-Buddhist movement** (廃仏毀釈, *haibutsu kishaku*) led to the destruction of some Buddhist property [^cite_84](^cite_84). The aim was to elevate what was now termed **“Shintō” as the native cult** of imperial Japan. However, the Meiji leaders faced a dilemma: Western nations insisted on **religious freedom**, which Japan had to grant in order to revise unequal treaties. How to have a State Shintō and still allow freedom of religion? The solution was nuanced and revealed Japan’s continued resistance to Western-style exclusive religion.

Meiji thinkers, after much debate, **redefined Shintō not as a “religion” but as a combination of national ceremony, morality, and loyalty**. In 1871, the government institutionalized **“Shrine Shintō”** (later called State Shintō) as a set of **rites of state** overseen by the **Jingikan (which was briefly revived)** and later by the Home Ministry. They declared that visiting shrines and venerating the emperor and ancestral kami was an expression of patriotism and heritage, *not* an optional faith choice [^cite_85](^cite_85) [^cite_86](^cite_86). Meanwhile, they coined the term **shūkyō** (宗教) to classify **Buddhism, Christianity, and sectarian Shintō** as “religions” in the Western sense – meaning systems of personal belief that individuals could choose freely in private, as guaranteed by the new constitution [^cite_87](^cite_87) [^cite_88](^cite_88). Josephson notes that Japanese officials *“excluded Shintō from the category [religion](religion)(of). Instead, they enshrined it as a national ideology while relegating [folk practices](various) to the category of ‘superstitions’”* [^cite_89](^cite_89). In effect, **Japan maintained its pluralism by creating a **dual structure''': 

- **State/Shintō (non-religious civic practice):** All citizens were expected to participate in Shintō shrine rites (such as bowing at a shrine, observing imperial ceremonies, worshiping at Yasukuni Shrine for war dead) as a form of civic duty and expression of Japanese identity. This was called *“Shrine Shintō”* and officially deemed **not a religion** but the indigenous, public tradition of Japan [^cite_90](^cite_90) [^cite_91](^cite_91). The idea was that one could be a Buddhist or Christian **and** still pay respects at a Shintō shrine, just as one salutes a flag or sings a national anthem. The Meiji state thereby avoided framing Shintō in a way that would trigger “freedom of religion” clauses – since it was *above* or *outside* that realm, **a matter of state ceremonies and moral cultivation**. (This move was foreshadowed by the earlier logic of the Ritsuryō code and Confucian thought, which treated kami rites as civic ritual separate from doctrinal religion [^cite_92](^cite_92) [^cite_93](^cite_93).)  
- **Private Religion (shūkyō):** Buddhism was allowed to continue, but it was now explicitly a “religion” – meaning a voluntary association of believers, one among multiple faiths. The Meiji government initially tried to marginalize Buddhism (hence the brief *haibutsu kishaku*), but by the 1870s it backed off and even relied on Buddhist temples for social functions. Christianity, newly permitted after 1873, was likewise categorized as a private religion, as were new sects like **Tenrikyō** or **Konkokyō** (which emerged from Shintō lineages but had to register as sectarian religious organizations). The Meiji Constitution of 1889 guaranteed limited **freedom of religious belief**, but with the caveat that it not disturb public order – meaning State Shintō and imperial reverence remained paramount.

This Meiji innovation is what Josephson calls a *“politically charged, boundary-drawing exercise”* that profoundly reconfigured Japan’s religious landscape [^cite_94](^cite_94). On one hand, it **reshaped Shintō**: what once had been an amalgam of shrine practices entwined with Buddhism was now purified and presented as an ancient, **unified national cult** directly tied to the Emperor (who was declared a *arahitogami*, living god). The **Jingikan** was briefly restored in 1868, then replaced in 1872 by a **Ministry of Divinities** (教部省) and soon after by the Home Ministry’s Shrine Bureau – signaling the state’s tight control over shrine rites [^cite_95](^cite_95). Priests became civil servants, and teaching of “Shintō doctrine” was initially attempted through the **Great Teaching Campaign** (1870s), though it faltered. On the other hand, the pluralism did not disappear: **Buddhism remained deeply rooted** (most Japanese continued to rely on Buddhist priests for funerals and ancestral rituals), and it adapted to the new era by reforming its institutions. **Christianity gained a foothold** but remained a small minority, partly because the majority of Japanese saw no need to replace their mixed heritage with an exclusivist creed. Moreover, the state tacitly encouraged **new religions** that blended elements of Shintō, Buddhism, and folk belief (many of these emerged in late 19th century) as long as they registered as sects and did not challenge imperial ideology. Thus, even as Japan modernized, it *“did not eliminate Japan’s pluralistic religious landscape”* – it reorganized it [^cite_96](^cite_96).

By the early 20th century, **State Shintō** functioned as a **civil religion**: shrine attendance, emperor worship, and national festivals were promoted as expressions of patriotism (akin to how Roman state cult or modern national ceremonies function). Meanwhile, individuals could privately be **Shin Buddhists, Catholics, Shintō sectarians, etc.** This arrangement preserved the **practical pluralism** of Japanese society under a new intellectual framework. It is telling that even under State Shintō, Japan never posited a single creator deity or mandatory theology – Amaterasu was venerated as the imperial ancestor and highest kami, but not portrayed as a jealous monotheistic god; other kami continued to be worshipped, and the imperial rescripts encouraged morality and reverence rather than doctrinal conformity. Scholars like Helen Hardacre and Jason Josephson have shown that this period saw the **conscious crafting of Shintō into something resembling a state “non-religious religion”**, a concept alien to Western categories [^cite_97](^cite_97) [^cite_98](^cite_98). The very contradiction of State Shintō – a state-prescribed set of beliefs deemed not religious – underscores Japan’s unique path. It *resisted* adopting an exclusive universal religion (even as it borrowed the trappings of modern nation-state religion) and instead **re-asserted its traditional pluralism** in new form. 

Indeed, Kuroda would argue that it was only through this Meiji-era process that Shintō emerged “clearly” as what we now call an independent tradition – and even then, it was a **highly engineered construct** built out of ancient myths, royal rites, and selectively pruned folk practices [^cite_99](^cite_99) [^cite_100](^cite_100). The legacy of this in the 20th century was complex: after World War II, State Shintō was abolished under the Allied occupation’s mandate for separation of religion and state, and Shintō shrines became private religious institutions. But the **underlying cultural pluralism** remained: most Japanese to this day engage in a mix of practices (visiting shrines at New Year, Buddhist funerals, Christian-style weddings, etc.), often without feeling any conflict. The Meiji period, far from converting Japan to a Western-style religious model, actually demonstrated how Japanese society could *compartmentalize* and adapt external concepts to preserve its **multi-layered spiritual heritage**. As Josephson observes, the very act of defining *religion* in Japan *“extensively reclassified the inherited materials of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shintō to lasting effect”* [^cite_101](^cite_101), but it did not uproot them. Japan entered the modern era with **religious pluralism codified rather than erased** – Shintō, Buddhism, and later new religions all became part of a complex tapestry, overseen (but not unified) by the modern state.

## Comparative Perspectives: Resisting Religious Unification vs. Western and Persian Models

Japan’s historical resistance to religious unification can be further highlighted by comparing it to other great civilizations that *did* undergo religious consolidation under monotheism or a singular orthodoxy. Two instructive comparisons are ancient **Rome** and **Persia**:

- **Roman Empire (and its College of Pontiffs):** Much like Japan’s early rulers, the Romans maintained a state-supported polytheistic cult for centuries. Rome had its own form of a “Department of Divinity” in the form of the **College of Pontiffs** (Collegium Pontificum). This body, led by the Pontifex Maximus, oversaw state rituals, maintained the sacred calendar, and regulated the priesthoods of various gods [^cite_102](^cite_102). The **pontiffs’ role** was analogous in some ways to the Jingikan: they ensured the proper performance of ceremonies and the observance of auspices for the well-being of the state [^cite_103](^cite_103). Under this collegial system, the Roman state cult was quite inclusive – numerous gods from Jupiter and Mars to imported deities like Cybele or Isis were worshipped, and **local gods of conquered peoples were often assimilated** (the Roman principle of *interpretatio* allowed identifying foreign gods with Roman ones). For centuries, Rome *thrived* on religious pluralism not unlike Japan’s, with an underlying civic ideology (the **Mos Maiorum**, customs of the ancestors) analogous to Japan’s use of Confucian/Shintō ethics. **However, Rome eventually took a different turn:** in the 4th century CE, it embraced **Christianity as a universal religion**. After Emperor Constantine and especially Theodosius I (in 380 CE) made **Nicene Christianity the state church**, the old pluralism of the College of Pontiffs was dismantled [^cite_104](^cite_104). The imperial government began to suppress the traditional cults; the temples to Jupiter and others were closed or repurposed. In a relatively short span, the Roman Empire shifted from many gods to effectively one (the Christian God), enforced by law. The **pontifex maximus** title was eventually adopted by the Pope, and the institutional continuity passed to the Church. Rome’s political evolution thus included a **religious unification** under a monotheistic creed – something **Japan never experienced**. When faced with universalist religions (first Buddhism, later Christianity), Japan integrated or contained them rather than allowing one to replace the rest. Unlike Rome, which by Late Antiquity came to see the old gods as false and the new God as the exclusive truth, Japan **persisted in seeing truth in all its traditions**. Even today, one could say Japan has no direct equivalent of the Roman Catholic Church – no single religious authority ever ruled the spiritual realm of all Japanese in the way the Church did in medieval Europe.

- **Persian Empire (and Zoroastrian priesthood):** The Persian Empires, especially the **Sassanian Empire (224–651 CE)**, offer another counterpoint. Ancient Persia originally had diverse cults and deities, but by Sassanian times, **Zoroastrianism** had become the **state religion**, closely tied to the monarchy. The Sassanian rulers elevated Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian supreme god, and supported a powerful **priestly class (magi or mobeds)** who enforced religious orthodoxy. Sources indicate that the Sassanids practiced a **strict form of Zoroastrian orthodoxy** – heresy and apostasy were not tolerated. In fact, those who **renounced the state religion could be punished by death** under Sassanian rule [^cite_105](^cite_105). Competing faiths like Manichaeism were brutally persecuted; Christianity and Judaism, which did exist in the empire, were often viewed with suspicion or repressed, especially during periods of conflict with Christian Rome. The **Zoroastrian priesthood** thus wielded tremendous institutional power, acting as gatekeepers of a more or less unified religious doctrine serving the state. This is markedly different from Japan: at no point did Japan have a priestly class that could impose such exclusivity across the population. Even at the height of State Shintō, *heresy* was not really a concept – the state was concerned with political loyalty, not with stamping out heterodox belief in private. In Persia’s case, **monotheistic (or dualistic) overcoding** eventually did occur – Zoroastrianism itself, while not purely monotheistic (some call it dualist with one supreme God), carried an absolutist tone and the later Sassanian ideology admitted little religious pluralism within Iran. The outcome was that when Islam arrived in the 7th century, the old Zoroastrian establishment, rigid and closely tied to the state, could not adapt and **rapidly collapsed**; Persia was Islamized in the ensuing centuries. Japan’s religious scene, by contrast, was so plural and decentered that when faced with external pressure (like Christian missions or later secularization), it bent but did not break – **no single dominant priesthood could fall and take the society’s faith with it**. Additionally, while the Persian emperor was sacralized as a divinely sanctioned “King of Kings” upholding one true faith, the Japanese emperors (even in their Meiji apotheosis) never demanded that their subjects **abjure all other gods**. 

In essence, these comparisons underscore Japan’s **unique historical trajectory**. In Rome, a collegial, pluralistic system gave way to a universal religion; in Persia, a monotheistic state religion was enforced by a centralized priesthood. Japan, however, consistently **avoided both of these outcomes**. Instead of a single religious law for all (like Rome’s later decrees or Persia’s high orthodoxy), Japan maintained a layered approach: a central ideology of rule (first mythic-ritual, later ethical-national) coexisted with a diversity of religious practices among the populace. One might even say Japan’s model was closer to the **early Roman Empire** (when many cults were tolerated under an imperial cult) than to the late empire – with the crucial difference that Japan never imposed an exclusive imperial cult that displaced others. Even at the peak of State Shintō, Japanese subjects were not asked to deny Buddha or Christ; they were asked to affirm the emperor and participate in Shintō rites, which **most Christians found incompatible, but many Buddhists and Shintō sectarians did not**, given the syncretic habit [^cite_106](^cite_106). The result was that **monotheism never dominated Japan**: Shintō remained polytheistic (with myriad kami), Buddhism in Japan was itself non-monotheistic and happy to coexist, and Confucianism provided a non-theistic moral order. 

**Institutional evolution** played a key role in this resistance. The **Jingikan** can be likened to Rome’s College of Pontiffs in function – centralizing ritual authority – but it never had the coercive dogmatic power to declare one god or one creed supreme. And when a form of supreme creed *was* declared (State Shintō), it was framed so as not to invalidate other beliefs. **Japanese religious institutions proved malleable and inclusive**, capable of balancing multiple streams (kami, Buddhas, ancestors, nature spirits) in a single ritual system. By contrast, the Roman Church or the Zoroastrian Magi took much harder stances on exclusivity when in power. 

From a broad perspective, Japan’s case shows an alternate path in the development of civilization: one where **“religious pluralism” was not a transitional phase to monotheism but a persistent state** of affairs. Scholars have long debated why Japan never produced an indigenous prophet or reformer who insisted on one true god or one true way. Some suggest that the **very concept of kami** – multiplicious, sharding into countless avatars – ingrained a cultural acceptance of divine diversity. Others point to the **political balance**: no conquering emperor or shōgun ever tied legitimacy to enforcing a single faith (even Hideyoshi and Ieyasu, who banned Christianity, did so for political security, not to install a rival exclusive creed). **Helen Hardacre’s** research stresses the continuity of the Jingikan and shrine traditions as a stable backdrop that made a separate “church” unnecessary [^cite_107](^cite_107). **Kuroda Toshio’s** influential thesis goes further, arguing that *“Shintō”* as we think of it was not an independent tradition at all until modernity – rather, the religious life of Japan was governed by what he calls the **kenmitsu (exoteric-esoteric) Buddhist system**, within which kami worship was embedded [^cite_108](^cite_108) [^cite_109](^cite_109). In this view, Japan’s **“resistance” to unification** was almost unconscious: there was never a vacuum in which a unifier like a Moses, Jesus, or Muhammad could operate, because the syncretic web of institutions always precluded that kind of radical break. 

Of course, these issues remain debated. Some scholars (and prewar Shintō ideologues) saw Shintō as **Japan’s primal “one true religion”** that simply never needed to compete – an idea dismissed by most historians, since Shintō itself has diverse forms and absorbed much from Buddhism. Others, like **Robert Bellah**, have suggested that Japan did undergo an “Axial Age” transformation of a sort with the introduction of Buddhism and Confucianism, but that this led not to religious revolution but to a **remarkable layering** of traditions, yielding what Bellah termed a “tradition of no tradition,” meaning a culture where **multiple traditions coexist without a single dominant theology**. In any case, by comparing Japan with Rome and Persia, we see that Japan stands out for **maintaining religious pluralism as a core feature of its civilization**. It neither succumbed to a universalist missionary religion (as Rome did with Christianity) nor enforced a strict state monotheism (as Sassanid Persia did with Zoroastrianism). Instead, Japan’s religious history is characterized by **continuity amid diversity** – a complex evolution in which *synthesis and incorporation* consistently triumphed over *exclusion and replacement*. 

In summary, from the early tribal kami rites of Yayoi and Kofun, through the sophisticated syncretism of the Heian and medieval eras, and even into the nation-building of Meiji, Japan **managed to avoid the “one-faith” paradigm**. It cultivated institutions (like the Jingikan and shrine network) that centralized worship while honoring local autonomy [^cite_110](^cite_110) [^cite_111](^cite_111); it embraced new religions by **assimilative syncretism** rather than by competition [^cite_112](^cite_112) [^cite_113](^cite_113); and when confronted with modern pressures, it redefined “religion” itself to keep **State Shintō and plural belief** side by side [^cite_114](^cite_114) [^cite_115](^cite_115). This historico-institutional strategy ensured that **no single religious ideology could overcode the rest**. Japan’s people could honor innumerable kami, follow the teachings of Buddha, heed Confucian ethics, and even experiment with Western religion – all without relinquishing their older practices. Thus, Japan offers a vivid example of how a great civilization can maintain **religious pluralism** as a continuous thread, resisting the centripetal pull of monotheistic or universalist movements that elsewhere often led to the eclipse of older religions. In the Japanese case, the **“great mix” of religions and rituals** (to use Hori Ichirō’s phrase) has been not a temporary syncretism but an enduring way of life [^cite_116](^cite_116) – one that has survived intact from the age of ancient myths right up to the present day.

These sources and others provide a comprehensive look at how Japan’s religious institutions and ideologies developed in a direction that continually **affirmed multiplicity**. Japan’s case illustrates that a strong central state need not impose a single religion to forge identity – it can, as Japan did, act as the curator of a diverse religious heritage, **preventing any one tradition from monopolizing the spiritual lives of the people** [^cite_128](^cite_128) [^cite_129](^cite_129). The Japanese experience of maintaining **“many paths”** under one culture stands as a testament to a successful pluralistic paradigm, one that has survived pressures that in other societies led to religious homogenization. Japan, in effect, defined its own kind of **sacred imperium**: not the empire of one god, but an empire where **all gods had a place**.  [^cite_130](^cite_130) [^cite_131](^cite_131)
