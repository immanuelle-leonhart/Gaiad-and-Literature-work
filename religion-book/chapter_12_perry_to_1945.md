# Chapter 12: From Perry's Black Ships to the Shinto Directive (1853-1945)

*[RESOLVES CHAPTER 11 CLIFFHANGER - Completes Japan Narrative]*

**"Religion" is a matter of the heart and conscience of the individual person and should not be controlled by political power. —General MacArthur's Shinto Directive, December 15, 1945**

## Introduction: The Completion of Japan's Religious Transformation

When Commodore Matthew Perry's black ships arrived in Edo Bay in July 1853, they brought more than military pressure for trade opening—they carried the Protestant-derived concept of "religion" that would ultimately force Japan to reorganize its entire spiritual landscape according to Western categories. This chapter completes the narrative begun in Chapter 11, tracing how external pressure and internal modernization combined to transform Japan's pluralistic spiritual system into the modern framework of "State Shinto" and private "religions."

The period from 1853 to 1945 represents one of history's most dramatic examples of how the Protestant concept of "religion" was imposed globally through imperial pressure. Japan's response—creating State Shinto as "non-religious" national ideology while categorizing Buddhism and Christianity as private "religions"—demonstrates both the flexibility and violence involved in forcing non-Western spiritual systems into Western categorical frameworks.

This transformation culminates in the 1945 Shinto Directive, when American occupying forces completed the process by forcing even State Shinto into the "religion" category, officially secularizing Japan according to American Protestant church-state separation principles. Japan's experience thus provides the clearest example of how "religion" as a universal category was created through colonial and imperial imposition rather than natural cultural development.

## 1. Perry's Arrival and the "Religion" Problem (1853-1868)

### 1.1 The Black Ships and Forced Opening

Commodore Perry's arrival in 1853 with four warships represented more than military intimidation—it marked the first systematic attempt to impose Protestant-derived international law on a non-Christian society. Perry's demands, backed by the threat of bombardment, included not only trade relationships but American concepts of diplomatic protocol, legal jurisdiction, and crucially, "religious freedom."

The Convention of Kanagawa (1854) and subsequent Harris Treaty (1858) contained provisions requiring Japan to allow American citizens to practice Christianity and eventually to grant "religious liberty" to Japanese subjects. These demands forced Japanese officials to confront Western concepts that had no direct equivalent in Japanese thought.

Japanese officials struggled to understand what Americans meant by "religion." The closest Japanese concepts were *shū* (sect or teaching) and *kyō* (doctrine or education), but these didn't carry Western implications of private belief separate from cultural practice and state ceremony. The Tokugawa government's initial response was to treat Christianity as a dangerous foreign political ideology rather than a private spiritual choice.

### 1.2 The Creation of Shūkyō (Religion)

To negotiate with Western powers, Japanese intellectuals had to invent new terminology and conceptual frameworks. The term *shūkyō* (宗教, literally "sectarian teaching") was coined in the 1860s to translate the Western concept of "religion." This translation work was not neutral—it required Japanese thinkers to reimagine their entire spiritual landscape according to Protestant assumptions.

Fukuzawa Yukichi and other Western-educated intellectuals argued that Japan needed to separate "religion" from "government" to achieve Western-style civilization. This separation was foreign to Japanese experience, where kami worship, Buddhist practices, and Confucian ethics were integrated aspects of social and political life rather than distinct private beliefs.

The intellectual challenge was enormous. How could Japan maintain its spiritual traditions while conforming to Western demands for religious freedom? The solution required fundamental reconceptualization of Japanese spiritual life according to Protestant categories of public/private, secular/religious, and state/church distinctions.

### 1.3 The End of Christian Prohibition

In 1873, under continued Western pressure, the Meiji government officially lifted the ban on Christianity that had been in place since 1614. This decision represented capitulation to American Protestant missionary pressure and marked the beginning of Japan's forced accommodation to religious pluralism.

However, the end of Christian prohibition created new problems. If Christianity was now a legitimate "religion," what was the status of Buddhism, Shinto practices, and Confucian ethics? Japanese officials realized they needed to reorganize their entire spiritual system according to Western "religion" versus "secular" categories.

The result was a systematic process of religious categorization that transformed Japan's integrated spiritual culture into separate institutional spheres designed to satisfy Western diplomatic and missionary demands while preserving Japanese cultural autonomy.

## 2. The Meiji Religious Settlement: Creating State Shinto (1868-1890)

### 2.1 The Department of Divinities and Shinbutsu Bunri

The Meiji Restoration of 1868 initiated the most systematic reorganization of spiritual life in Japanese history. The new government immediately established the *Jingikan* (Department of Divinities) as one of the two highest governmental organs, elevating kami worship to unprecedented institutional prominence.

Simultaneously, the government ordered *shinbutsu bunri* (separation of kami and buddhas), legally disentangling Shinto shrines from Buddhist temples for the first time in over a millennium. This separation was not culturally natural—it required massive institutional reorganization and often violent destruction of syncretic religious sites.

The separation policy triggered the *haibutsu kishaku* (abolish Buddhism, destroy Shakyamuni) movement, during which thousands of Buddhist temples were destroyed or converted to Shinto shrines. This destruction represented the violence inherent in forcing integrated spiritual systems into Western-style institutional categories.

### 2.2 The Great Teaching Campaign

Between 1870 and 1884, the Meiji government conducted the *Taikyō Senpu* (Great Teaching Campaign) to indoctrinate the Japanese population in imperial ideology presented as spiritual teaching. The campaign combined Shinto mythology, Confucian ethics, and imperial loyalty into a systematic program of national spiritual education.

The Great Teaching Campaign represented Japan's attempt to create a Western-style "civil religion" that could function alongside private religious freedom. By packaging imperial ideology as spiritual teaching, the government hoped to maintain cultural unity while satisfying Western demands for religious liberty.

However, the campaign failed because it tried to transform Japan's pluralistic spiritual culture into unified ideological system. Popular resistance, Buddhist opposition, and internal governmental conflicts led to the campaign's abandonment in 1884, forcing Japan to develop alternative approaches to the "religion problem."

### 2.3 The Invention of "Non-Religious" State Shinto

Japan's solution to the religion problem was conceptually brilliant and practically effective: defining State Shinto as "non-religious" national ideology while categorizing other spiritual traditions as private "religions." This distinction allowed Japan to maintain spiritual unity while conforming to Western religious freedom requirements.

State Shinto was presented as patriotic ceremony, moral education, and cultural tradition rather than religious practice. Shrine worship became civic duty comparable to flag salutation or national anthem singing. The emperor was declared a living god (*arahitogami*) but in a political rather than religious sense.

This "non-religious" classification of State Shinto was legally codified in the Meiji Constitution of 1889, which guaranteed "freedom of religious belief" while requiring all subjects to participate in imperial ceremonies. The constitutional language carefully avoided defining State Shinto as religion while protecting private religious choice.

## 3. Religious Institutionalization and the Modern System (1890-1912)

### 3.1 Buddhist Adaptation and Sectarian Registration

Buddhism adapted to the new religious system by reorganizing into officially recognized sects registered with the government. The traditional temple system was maintained but redefined as private religious association rather than public cultural institution.

Buddhist leaders generally cooperated with Meiji religious policy, accepting subordination to State Shinto in exchange for institutional survival and continued social functions. Buddhist temples remained responsible for funerals and ancestral rites, while Shinto shrines handled community festivals and national ceremonies.

This institutional division created the modern Japanese religious system: State Shinto as public spiritual culture, Buddhism as private religious association, and Christianity as foreign religious option. Each sphere operated according to different rules and served different social functions.

### 3.2 Christian Missionary Expansion

American Protestant missionaries used the 1873 legalization of Christianity to establish extensive missionary operations throughout Japan. Mission schools, hospitals, and social service programs introduced American-style institutional Christianity designed to compete with traditional Japanese spiritual traditions.

Christian missionary success was limited but culturally significant. Elite Japanese intellectuals, including political leaders and educators, converted to Christianity as symbol of Western civilization and modernity. Christian institutions became important channels for Western cultural influence.

However, Japanese Christianity remained largely confined to educated urban minorities. The majority of Japanese saw no need to abandon their spiritual heritage for exclusive Christian faith. Christianity's minority status actually strengthened the argument that Japan needed State Shinto as unifying national spiritual culture.

### 3.3 New Religious Movements and Sectarian Shinto

The Meiji period saw explosive growth of new religious movements that combined Shinto, Buddhist, and folk elements in innovative syntheses. Groups like Tenrikyo, Konkokyo, and Omotokyo created new spiritual communities while conforming to government registration requirements.

These new religions were classified as "Sectarian Shinto" (*Kyōha Shintō*) and granted limited autonomy as private religious associations. They could operate freely as long as they didn't challenge State Shinto ideology or imperial authority.

The proliferation of new religions demonstrated Japan's continued spiritual creativity within the new religious framework. Rather than destroying Japanese spiritual innovation, the Meiji religious system channeled it into private sectarian organizations while maintaining public spiritual unity through State Shinto.

## 4. Imperial Expansion and Religious Export (1895-1931)

### 4.1 Taiwan and the Colonial Laboratory

Japan's acquisition of Taiwan in 1895 provided the first laboratory for exporting the Meiji religious system to colonial territories. Japanese colonial administrators established State Shinto shrines throughout Taiwan while allowing limited religious freedom for Chinese Buddhism and folk practices.

The Taiwan experience demonstrated how State Shinto could function as imperial ideology in multicultural contexts. Local Taiwanese were required to participate in shrine ceremonies as expressions of imperial loyalty, while maintaining their own religious traditions as private cultural practices.

Colonial religious policy in Taiwan refined techniques that would later be applied in Korea, Manchuria, and occupied Southeast Asia. State Shinto became the spiritual dimension of Japanese imperial expansion, providing ideological unity across ethnically diverse territories.

### 4.2 Korea and Forced Spiritual Integration

Japanese colonization of Korea (1910-1945) involved systematic suppression of Korean cultural and spiritual autonomy. Korean Buddhist temples were subordinated to Japanese Buddhist sects, Confucian academies were converted to imperial loyalty education, and Korean shamanic practices were classified as "superstition."

Most controversially, Koreans were required to worship at State Shinto shrines as expressions of imperial loyalty. This requirement generated massive Korean resistance, as Christians and traditional religionists viewed shrine worship as forced apostasy and cultural surrender.

The Korean resistance to State Shinto revealed the violent imperial dimension of Japan's religious system. What appeared as voluntary civic ceremony in Japan became forced cultural conversion in colonial contexts, exposing State Shinto's function as imperial ideology disguised as non-religious national tradition.

### 4.3 Manchuria and Pan-Asian Spiritual Unity

The creation of Manchukuo (1932) represented Japan's most ambitious attempt to create pan-Asian spiritual unity under State Shinto leadership. Japanese officials established elaborate State Shinto shrines while attempting to incorporate Chinese, Korean, Mongolian, and Russian spiritual traditions into imperial ideological framework.

Manchukuo's religious policy combined Japanese State Shinto, Chinese Confucianism, and Mongolian shamanism into synthetic imperial ideology. This experimentation demonstrated Japan's vision of religious modernization as alternative to Western Christian civilization.

However, the Manchukuo experiment revealed the limits of Japan's religious synthesis. Forced spiritual integration generated resistance from local populations who viewed Japanese religious policy as cultural imperialism rather than modernizing reform.

## 5. Militarization and Spiritual Mobilization (1931-1941)

### 5.1 The Rise of Ultranationalism

The Manchurian Incident (1931) marked the beginning of Japan's transformation from constitutional monarchy to totalitarian military state. This political transformation required corresponding intensification of State Shinto as spiritual mobilization system.

Ultranationalist movements like the Imperial Way Faction (*Kōdōha*) promoted emperor worship as absolute spiritual authority transcending legal and moral limitations. State Shinto evolved from civic ceremonialism into totalitarian spiritual system demanding complete personal surrender to imperial will.

The assassination of moderate political leaders and suppression of liberal religious groups eliminated internal resistance to spiritual totalitarianism. By the mid-1930s, State Shinto had become the spiritual foundation of fascist political system.

### 5.2 Religious Suppression and Spiritual Uniformity

The government systematically suppressed religious groups that challenged State Shinto orthodoxy. Omotokyo, the largest new religious movement, was brutally suppressed in 1935, with leaders arrested and properties destroyed. Christian groups faced increasing pressure to demonstrate patriotic loyalty through shrine worship.

The Religious Organizations Law of 1939 placed all religious groups under direct government control. Buddhist sects, Christian denominations, and Sectarian Shinto groups were forced to merge into governmentally approved organizations that actively supported military policies.

Religious suppression reached its peak with the creation of the Greater Japan Wartime Religious Patriotic Association in 1941, which subordinated all religious organizations to State Shinto war mobilization. Japan had transformed from religious pluralism to spiritual totalitarianism in less than seventy years.

### 5.3 Kamikaze and Ultimate Spiritual Mobilization

The Pacific War (1941-1945) represented the logical culmination of State Shinto spiritual militarization. The kamikaze (divine wind) attacks embodied the complete merger of emperor worship, death cult, and military strategy.

Kamikaze pilots were spiritually prepared through intensive State Shinto indoctrination emphasizing death for emperor as highest spiritual achievement. Their final letters home reveal internalization of State Shinto ideology that transformed suicide attacks into religious acts of ultimate devotion.

The kamikaze phenomenon demonstrated State Shinto's effectiveness as totalitarian spiritual system capable of motivating mass self-sacrifice. However, it also revealed the ultimate destructiveness of spirituality subordinated to military-political power.

## 6. Defeat, Occupation, and the Shinto Directive (1945)

### 6.1 The Emperor's Surrender and Spiritual Crisis

Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945, precipitated unprecedented spiritual crisis. Emperor Hirohito's radio announcement acknowledging defeat shattered the fundamental premise of State Shinto ideology—imperial invincibility and divine protection of Japan.

The surrender created immediate questions about the emperor's divine status, State Shinto's truth claims, and the relationship between spiritual belief and political authority. Many Japanese experienced complete disillusionment with the spiritual system that had demanded ultimate sacrifice for ultimately meaningless war.

However, the surrender also created opportunities for spiritual renewal and democratization. Liberation from State Shinto totalitarianism opened space for genuine religious freedom and cultural reconstruction according to democratic principles.

### 6.2 MacArthur's Religious Policy and American Protestant Assumptions

General Douglas MacArthur's occupation administration brought American Protestant assumptions about religion and democracy to Japan's spiritual reconstruction. MacArthur personally believed that Japan needed Christian conversion to become truly democratic society.

The occupation's religious policy reflected Protestant church-state separation principles: complete separation of government and religion, individual freedom of conscience, and voluntary religious association. These principles were foreign to Japanese experience but were imposed as requirements for democratic transformation.

MacArthur's staff included numerous Protestant missionaries and educators who viewed the occupation as providential opportunity to Christianize Japan. Their influence shaped occupation religious policy toward promoting Christian missions while dismantling State Shinto.

### 6.3 The Shinto Directive: Completing the Religious Transformation

On December 15, 1945, the occupation issued the "Shinto Directive," officially titled "Abolition of Governmental Sponsorship, Support, Perpetuation, Control, and Dissemination of State Shinto." This directive completed Japan's religious transformation by forcing even State Shinto into the private "religion" category.

The directive was remarkably comprehensive:
- Abolished all governmental support for Shinto shrines
- Prohibited public officials from participating in shrine ceremonies in official capacity  
- Removed State Shinto instruction from public education
- Required shrines to become private religious organizations
- Banned use of public funds for religious purposes

Most significantly, the directive forced Emperor Hirohito to renounce his divine status in the "Humanity Declaration" (*ningen sengen*) of January 1, 1946. The emperor declared: "The ties between Us and Our people... do not depend upon mere legends and myths. They are not predicated on the false conception that the Emperor is divine."

### 6.4 The New Constitution and Religious Freedom

The 1947 Constitution, drafted under American supervision, institutionalized Protestant church-state separation principles in Japanese law. Article 20 guaranteed complete religious freedom while prohibiting government involvement in religious activities.

The constitutional language reflected American Protestant assumptions about religion as private individual belief separate from public cultural life. This framework was imposed on Japan despite its historical experience of integrated spiritual and social systems.

The Constitution's religious clauses created ongoing tensions in Japanese society. Traditional practices like school visits to local shrines, public funeral ceremonies, and seasonal festivals were legally problematic under strict church-state separation requirements imported from American Protestant experience.

## 7. Aftermath: The Secularization of Japan (1945-1950)

### 7.1 Shrine Reorganization and Private Religion

Japanese shrines were forced to organize as private religious corporations (*shūkyō hōjin*) under the Religious Corporations Ordinance of 1945, later replaced by the Religious Corporations Law of 1951. This transformation represented the final stage of forcing Japanese spiritual traditions into Western "religion" categories.

The shrine system adapted by creating Jinja Honchō (Association of Shinto Shrines) in 1946 as umbrella organization for most shrines. However, this private association lacked the governmental authority and financial support that had sustained the shrine system for over a millennium.

Many local shrines struggled to survive as private religious organizations. Without government funding and with reduced community support, numerous shrines fell into disrepair or were abandoned entirely. The spiritual landscape of Japan was fundamentally altered by forced privatization.

### 7.2 Buddhist and Christian Responses

Japanese Buddhism experienced revival after liberation from State Shinto subordination. Buddhist organizations reorganized as independent religious corporations and resumed educational, cultural, and social service activities that had been restricted during the war period.

Christianity, despite occupation favoritism, remained a small minority religion. The destruction of war discredited State Shinto but didn't create mass conversion to Christianity. Most Japanese maintained traditional Buddhist and folk practices while embracing secular democratic values.

The occupying forces' expectation that Japan would undergo spiritual transformation toward Christianity proved mistaken. Japanese religious patterns demonstrated remarkable continuity despite massive institutional reorganization and legal transformation.

### 7.3 The Yasukuni Problem and Ongoing Tensions

The Yasukuni Shrine, dedicated to Japan's war dead, became focal point for ongoing tensions between traditional spiritual practices and imposed church-state separation. Prime ministerial visits to Yasukuni generated constitutional controversies that continue today.

The Yasukuni problem illustrates the fundamental incompatibility between Japanese spiritual traditions and American Protestant-derived constitutional principles. What Japanese viewed as normal commemoration of war dead, critics condemned as violation of religious freedom and church-state separation.

These ongoing constitutional tensions reveal how the forced imposition of "religion" categories created permanent conflicts in Japanese society between traditional cultural practices and imported legal frameworks.

## 8. Theoretical Analysis: The Colonial Imposition of "Religion"

### 8.1 Talal Asad and the Genealogy of Religion

Japan's experience provides perfect illustration of Talal Asad's argument that "religion" is a specifically Christian, post-Enlightenment category that was forcibly exported through colonial and imperial expansion. Japan had rich spiritual traditions but no concept equivalent to Western "religion" until forced to create one.

The process of creating *shūkyō* as translation for "religion" required fundamental reconceptualization of Japanese spiritual life according to Protestant assumptions about belief, practice, and institutional organization. This translation was not neutral but represented epistemological colonization.

Asad's analysis reveals how "religious freedom" functioned as imperial demand rather than universal human right. American insistence on religious freedom in Japan served to dismantle integrated spiritual-political systems that resisted Western cultural penetration.

### 8.2 Jason Josephson and the Invention of Religion in Japan

Jason Josephson's detailed analysis demonstrates how Japan's religious categories were literally invented to satisfy Western diplomatic and missionary demands. The distinction between "religious" and "non-religious" was unknown in Japanese thought until required for international relations.

Josephson shows how Japanese intellectuals creatively adapted Western religious categories while attempting to preserve cultural autonomy. The classification of State Shinto as "non-religious" was brilliant strategy for maintaining spiritual unity while conforming to Western religious freedom requirements.

However, this creative adaptation ultimately failed because Western powers retained definitional authority over "religion." The 1945 Shinto Directive demonstrated that Japan could not permanently maintain alternative definitions of religious and secular categories.

### 8.3 The Violence of Categorization

Japan's religious transformation reveals the violence inherent in forcing integrated spiritual systems into Western categorical frameworks. The *shinbutsu bunri* separation required destruction of syncretic religious sites that had existed for centuries.

The category of "superstition" was used to suppress folk practices that didn't conform to Western definitions of legitimate religion. Japanese spiritual traditions were forced into hierarchy determined by Western Protestant assumptions about proper religious form and content.

The ultimate violence was the 1945 Shinto Directive's forced secularization of Japanese society according to American Protestant church-state separation principles. This represented complete victory of Western religious categories over indigenous spiritual frameworks.

---

## 9. Comparative Analysis: Colonialism and Religious Categorization

### 9.1 India and the Census of Religion

British colonial administration in India similarly imposed "religion" as administrative category through census operations that forced Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and Muslim practices into Western denominational framework. Like Japan, India had diverse spiritual traditions but no equivalent to Christian "religion" concept.

The Indian colonial experience parallels Japan's in demonstrating how imperial powers used "religious freedom" rhetoric to justify cultural intervention and administrative control. Census categories became legal and political realities that shaped modern Indian religious identity.

Both cases reveal how Western "religious freedom" functioned as technique of colonial governmentality rather than protection of indigenous spiritual autonomy.

### 9.2 China and Missionary Encounter

Chinese responses to Western missionary pressure included similar attempts to define indigenous traditions as "non-religious" philosophy or ethics rather than competing religion. Confucianism was often presented as moral system rather than religious practice.

However, China's political weakness prevented successful maintenance of alternative religious categories. Western missionary and diplomatic pressure eventually forced China to accept Western religious frameworks, though with less systematic success than in Japan.

Chinese experience confirms that successful resistance to Western religious categorization required sufficient political and military power to maintain cultural autonomy while engaging in international relations.

### 9.3 Islamic World and the Challenge of Secular Religion

Islamic societies faced similar challenges in reconciling traditional integration of spiritual and political authority with Western demands for church-state separation. Turkey's Kemalist revolution represents most systematic attempt to create secular Muslim society.

However, Islamic theological traditions provided stronger resources for resisting Western religious categories than Japanese or Chinese traditions. Islamic law (*sharia*) offered alternative framework for integrating spiritual and legal authority that could compete with Western secular models.

Japan's experience was unique in the systematic success of creating "non-religious" state spirituality that satisfied Western diplomatic requirements while maintaining cultural autonomy, at least temporarily.

## 10. Conclusion: The Global Triumph of Protestant Religious Categories

### 10.1 From Pluralism to "Religion"

Japan's transformation from 1853 to 1945 represents the complete process by which Protestant-derived concepts of "religion" were imposed globally through imperial pressure. Japan began with integrated spiritual culture and ended with Western-style separation of religious and secular spheres.

This transformation was not natural cultural evolution but forced adaptation to Western power relations. Japan's creative attempts to maintain cultural autonomy within Western religious frameworks ultimately failed because Western powers retained definitional authority over legitimate religious and secular categories.

The 1945 Shinto Directive marked the final victory of Protestant religious categories over indigenous alternatives. Japan was forced to accept American definitions of religion, secularism, and church-state separation as universal human principles rather than culturally specific Protestant innovations.

### 10.2 The Legacy of Religious Colonialism

Japan's experience reveals the ongoing legacy of religious colonialism in contemporary global politics. International human rights discourse continues to privilege Protestant-derived religious categories while marginalizing indigenous spiritual frameworks that don't conform to Western church-state separation models.

The Yasukuni Shrine controversy demonstrates how imposed religious categories create permanent conflicts in non-Western societies between traditional cultural practices and international legal requirements based on Protestant assumptions.

Contemporary debates about "religious freedom" in China, Muslim societies, and Indigenous communities reflect the same colonial dynamics that transformed Japan's spiritual landscape in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

### 10.3 Lessons for Religious Studies

Japan's case study provides crucial evidence for understanding "religion" as historical artifact of Protestant colonialism rather than universal human category. The systematic documentation of Japan's religious transformation offers clear empirical foundation for post-colonial critiques of religious studies methodology.

Academic religious studies must acknowledge its role in universalizing Protestant religious categories and work to develop analytical frameworks that don't privilege Western spiritual assumptions over indigenous alternatives.

The Japanese experience suggests possibilities for recovering non-Western spiritual frameworks while engaging critically with the global dominance of Protestant-derived religious categories.

**Japan's transformation from Perry's arrival to the Shinto Directive thus represents the paradigmatic case of how "religion" as universal category was created through imperial imposition rather than natural cultural development. This completes our narrative of how Protestant innovations became global framework for understanding human spiritual life.**
