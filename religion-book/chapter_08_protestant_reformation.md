# Chapter 8: Protestant Reformation & the Birth of Modern "Religion"

## Executive Summary

The Protestant Reformation fundamentally transformed the way "religion" was understood, laying the groundwork for our modern idea of religion as a distinct, private sphere separate from politics, law, and community life. Before the Reformation, European societies (and many others worldwide) did not even have a concept of "religion" as an independent category – spiritual practices were deeply integrated with governance, culture, and daily life. The Reformation's theological innovations – such as Martin Luther's doctrine of sola scriptura (Scripture alone) and sola fide (faith alone) – elevated individual belief and personal conscience above institutional tradition. This revolutionary idea birthed new concepts of religious freedom that were eventually exported globally through colonialism and missionary movements, forcing indigenous peoples worldwide to classify their holistic lifeways into "religious" vs. "secular" categories that had never existed before.

## Timeline of Key Developments in the Concept of "Religion"

### Pre-1500 (Medieval era): No separate category of "religion" in most societies
Spiritual and political authority were unified in Christendom (e.g. the Pope and Holy Roman Emperor jointly governed), and in many non-Western cultures, sacred rituals were embedded in everyday social duties. For instance, Latin religio originally meant a personal pious obligation or monastic vow, not a separate institutional sphere. In many languages, there was no word for "religion" as distinct from culture – e.g. most Native American languages had no term for religion, since spirituality permeated all of life.

### 1517–1520s (Luther's Reformation): Martin Luther launches the Reformation
In writings like "Temporal Authority" (1523), Luther articulates the doctrine of the two governments or "two kingdoms." He argues that God established two distinct realms – spiritual governance (the Word and faith governing the soul) and temporal governance (the law and sword governing external society) – and that these must be "carefully distinguished." This undercut the medieval idea of a single corpus Christianum (unified church-state) and asserted that worldly government had no authority over the soul or personal faith.

### 1555 (Peace of Augsburg): The Holy Roman Empire signs the Peace of Augsburg
This legal treaty explicitly uses the concept of "religion" to delineate authority: "cuius regio, eius religio" – each prince can choose the religion (Catholic or Lutheran) of his territory. Significantly, this marks one of the first official uses of religion to mean a confessional category separate from secular rule. Historians note this moment as "the first step on the road toward a European system of sovereign states" with a private religious domain.

### 1618–1648 (Wars of Religion & Peace of Westphalia): A series of devastating wars across Europe fought largely over religious allegiance
The exhaustion leads to the Peace of Westphalia (1648), which is often considered a founding moment of the modern secular order. Westphalia's treaties entrenched religious freedom in a proto-liberal sense: subjects were granted rights to private worship even if it differed from the ruler's faith, and a secular legal mechanism was established to handle religious disputes without invoking theology. Westphalia explicitly imposed a public/private divide: secular authorities would handle public life, while religion became a matter of private conscience and voluntary practice.

### 1689 (Locke's Letter on Toleration): John Locke publishes A Letter concerning Toleration
Synthesizing Reformation principles, Locke makes a landmark argument for the separation of church and state. He writes that civil government is confined to "civil interests" – life, liberty, property, and public order – and "hath nothing to do with the world to come." The "care of souls," Locke insists, "is not committed to the civil magistrate", as true religion consists in inward belief that cannot be compelled by worldly force. He defines a church as a voluntary society of individuals, entered by personal choice, not by birth or coercion.

### 18th–19th centuries (Colonial Expansion and Classification): As European empires spread globally, they exported the Protestant concept of "religion" to cultures worldwide
Colonial administrators and missionaries, armed with this binary of "religious vs. secular," began classifying indigenous beliefs into Western categories. For example, the British in India worked to organize the diverse Indian traditions into a unified "Hinduism", treating it as a single "religion" alongside Christianity and Islam. All Indian spiritual practices that were not Christian or Muslim were lumped under this invented category "Hindu," reshaping Indians' self-understanding in the image of Western religion.

### Late 19th century (Indigenous Religions Repressed): The imposition of Western religious categories was frequently accompanied by coercion
In the United States, for instance, federal authorities in the late 1800s banned Native American ceremonies, deeming them pagan rather than true "religion." From 1883 to 1978, U.S. laws (the Code of Indian Offenses) actually criminalized Native religious ceremonies and enforced Christianization, punishing Indigenous people for dancing or consulting spiritual healers. Only in 1978 did the U.S. formally recognize Indigenous spiritual practices as protected religious freedom (American Indian Religious Freedom Act).

## Introduction: The Turn from Ritual to Belief

The Protestant Reformation did not merely reinterpret Christian doctrine; it recast the very structure of religious life in early modern Europe. In predominantly Catholic medieval Europe, "embodied" religion centered on communal ritual, sacramental symbols, and mythic cosmologies (the saints, the Mass as sacrifice, pilgrimages, indulgences, etc.). Protestantism, by contrast, prized inner faith and Scripture, subordinating outward ceremony to personal conviction and doctrine. This shift can be seen as a flattening of the old mythic order into a self-enclosed, rationalized belief system.

We analyze this transformation through a post-structuralist lens (especially Foucault's concept of discipline and power) while drawing on sociology (Weber's Protestant Ethic), intellectual history (Taylor on secular experience), and political economy (the reallocation of church wealth). Each section addresses one facet of the Reformation's restructuring of religion.

**This is where your central thesis begins** - the birth of belief-centric "religion" that gets exported globally through colonialism.

## 1. Economic Entanglements: Reformation and Early Capitalism

The Reformation emerged amid the breakdown of feudal order and the rise of commercial capitalism. As Cantoni et al. demonstrate, massive resources (land, wealth, human capital) shifted from ecclesiastical to secular hands. Closed monasteries and confiscated church lands funded palaces, roads, and civic institutions in Protestant territories. Cantoni, Dittmar, and Yuchtman (2017) find that "secular authorities acquired enormous amounts of wealth from monasteries closed during the Reformation," and that Protestant regions saw new investment in non-religious buildings (palaces, town halls). This "reallocation" of resources powered emerging bourgeois classes and civil bureaucracy (many graduates of Protestant universities went into public service). In short, Protestant reform created an economic base for capitalist society by diverting church rent-seeking into profit-seeking and state formation.

Max Weber's classic analysis similarly links Protestant doctrine to capitalist subjectivity. Weber noted that inner-worldly asceticism – the "calling" or Beruf – was given a religious stamp by Luther and especially Calvin. Luther proclaimed in On Christian Liberty (1520) that "A Christian man is the most free lord of all, and subject to none; [yet] a Christian man is the most dutiful servant of all, and subject to every one". This paradoxical doctrine of inner freedom under God laid the groundwork for a self-disciplined individual. Calvin in Geneva demanded a "monastic discipline for everyone," harnessing civic life to a rigorous piety. Weber argued that these Protestant innovations in conscience and labor discipline fostered "the spirit of capitalism": hard work and reinvestment became seen as moral duties. In Weber's words, Calvinism created "the most absolutely unbearable form of ecclesiastical control of the individual" – a control that paradoxically channelled people's energies into industrious worldly activity. Thus the Reformation's spirituality – sola fide, calling, worldly asceticism – intertwined with and advanced the rise of bourgeois wealth and individualist subjectivity.

Moreover, Protestant political theory often justified the sovereign taking the place of the church. In the Holy Roman Empire, cuius regio, eius religio (1555) allowed princes to seize former Catholic lands and impose state churches. Cantoni et al. note that this secularizing impulse was unintended but profound: Protestant "entry" was facilitated by emergent market societies willing to bear wealth into new "utility-maximizing" (in their terminology) contractual relations. In plain terms, where commerce thrived and the landed order weakened, both peasants and patricians found Lutheranism attractive – partly because it freed them from clerical tithes and obligations. By contrast, in stagnant feudal regions with strong nobility, the medieval Church could sustain its monopoly via patronage. Thus the Reformation both reflected and accelerated class realignments: it fostered bourgeois subjectivities of independent selfhood and profit-oriented discipline at the expense of feudal communalism.

## 2. Iconoclasm and Ritual Decoding

Protestant reformers launched an explicit attack on Catholic ritual and imagery. Initially, this took the form of iconoclasm: the mass destruction of statues, altars, and stained glass in many German, Swiss, and Dutch cities. Luther himself tolerated some images, but Zwingli and Calvin often proclaimed them "idols," to be purged. As one recent study notes, modern aesthetic theories of image and art were shaped by the Reformation's iconophobia. Protestants and Counter-Reformation Catholics together "exhib[ited] iconophilic and iconophobic aspects," and Protestant iconoclasm in the 1520s "had a strong influence" on later European views of images. In practice this meant that mythic symbolism was stripped bare. Where medieval churchgoers learned theology through ritual drama and icon, Protestant worship became "instructive": centered on preaching and singing, in the vernacular, with an emphasis on plain clarity. As a Catholic commentator observes, Protestant liturgy "emphasizes clarity and simplicity over mystery and complex ritual" – congregants now saw sermons rather than a sacred sacrifice, and ministers faced the people rather than leading esoteric rites.

This was more than aesthetic: the underlying theology reinterpreted every sacramental and seasonal symbol. The Mass ceased to be viewed as a mystical reenactment of Calvary; instead it became a commemorative Lord's Supper. Zwingli famously argued that Christ's presence in Communion is spiritual, not corporeal – a "memorial" meal for the faithful, not a magical transformation of bread. Luther retained a real presence but rescinded the Catholic notion of transubstantiation; Calvin spoke of a "mystical presence" but likewise rejected a physical sacrifice. In effect, ritual time was flattened into Scripture: saints' days and feast-days were often abandoned (except, say, Christmas and Easter) in favor of the Sunday sermon. Liturgical calendar and sacramental seasons gave way to the printed Bible read on a weekly cycle.

From a post-structuralist view, this was a "decoding" of mythic signs into propositional content. Jean-Luc Nancy points out that monotheism has always "withdrawn any myth or meaning from the world," positing a God removed from history. Protestantism extended this logic: the divine was accessible only in the unmediated Word. As Nancy writes, modernity's drive toward demythologization – stripping narrative out of social life "in the name of … reason [or] progress" – actually stems from this "atheistic logic of monotheism". In other words, Protestantism's assault on religious symbol was not against superstition alone but part of a deeper secularizing trajectory. Iconoclasm "dismantled" the old cosmos of signs so thoroughly that believers could only narrate history (biblical or moral) rather than feel mythic presence.

## 3. From Utopia to Discipline: Radical Sectarianism and Control

The Reformation unleashed utopian fervors, yet the Protestant mainstream quickly reined them in through political alliance and social discipline. Radical sects (Anabaptists, Munsterites, Familists, Spiritualists, etc.) envisioned Christian communities based on shared goods, visions of imminent apocalypse, and direct revelation. These were utopian projects – calls to remake society along egalitarian or mystical lines. For example, Münster (1534–35) briefly became an Anabaptist "New Jerusalem," complete with communal property and polygamy under self-styled "King David" Jan van Leyden. One historian notes that Münster "became the refuge of all persecuted, desperate people and the 'New Jerusalem' of radical Anabaptism," drawing oppressed believers across Europe. The city was besieged by the bishop's troops and retaken amid horrific carnage. With Münster's fall, authorities in Protestant cities grew determined to suppress any communal experiment that threatened order.

Why this turn from utopia to discipline? Partly because secular rulers (both Protestant princes and Catholic emperors) saw the economic and political threat these sects posed. Elders who repudiated private property or refused to swear loyalty to princes challenged the emerging territorial states. Thus Anabaptists were soon banned by both Protestant and Catholic magistrates; Münster's leaders were tortured and executed as a warning. The mainstream reformers (Lutherans, Reformed) largely disavowed the radicals. Luther condemned peasant revolts (1525) on theological grounds, urging princes to "slay even his father and mother" if they rebelled against order (a brutal stance to preserve peace). The Reformed in Zurich executed Anabaptists as heretics (e.g. Michael Sattler in 1527). In England and Scandinavia, even moderate Protestants under monarchy outlawed sects that undermined royal control of the church.

This "re-disciplining" of utopian excess can be read through Foucault's lens of power and subjectivation. Lindholm and Di Carlo (2024) argue that early Lutheranism already displayed disciplinary power: church services functioned like classrooms, training obedient subjects. In a famous Wittenberg altarpiece (by Cranach), Luther preaches from a pulpit to rapt congregants – a tableau much like Foucault's classroom illustration of surveillance and normalization. Here the minister is the teacher; the congregation is the disciplined class learning not Latin prayers but a doctrine. Foucault's concept of anatomo-politics applies: the Reformation increasingly positioned each soul under watchful guidance of preaching, catechism, and moral "calling." By the mid-1500s, Protestant pastors and consistories oversaw schooling, poor relief, and even punishments for sins like adultery or Sabbath-breaking. Paradoxically, Protestants who celebrated individual faith also created tighter social regimentation – what Weber and others called "the iron cage" of discipline – to prevent heterodox alternatives.

Thus, liberal utopian energies were turned inward or bureaucratized. Public ecstatic prophecy gave way to private moral introspection. Where radicals preached overthrow of old orders, established Protestants preached obedience to magistrates (as a divine ordinance). Economic self-help replaced communal sharing (apart from groups like the Hutterites, who were also soon hunted). In short, utopian fervor was domesticated: Protestant regimes curbed "excess" liberty by binding believers into state churches and market roles – a process very much in keeping with Foucault's genealogy of modern discipline.

## 4. Sacramental Collapse: Demystifying the Cosmos

Central to Catholic Christianity was a sacramental worldview: God's grace was mediated through visible rites and sacred objects. Transubstantiation, baptismal regeneration, confession, ordination, relics, and indulgences made the divine tangible. Protestantism, however, systematically collapsed this sacramental universe into scripture and conscience. Catholic salvation was communal and mystical; Protestant salvation was individual and textual. As Weber observed, the Lutheran Reformation "completely eliminated salvation through Church and sacraments," redefining faith as a personal relation with Christ.

What was lost or transformed? The Catholic cosmos – a vertical ordering of Heaven, Earth, and the underworld – was flattened. Purgatory vanished (Protestants abolished indulgences and the treasury of merit), so the uncertainty of souls after death was replaced by assurance of personal salvation or damnation. The Mass was no longer seen as a propitiatory sacrifice transcending time; it became a "supper" of remembrance. Calvin even likened the Lord's Supper to the daily bread we eat – a simple, earthly sign of Christ's hidden presence. Some Protestants went further: Zwingli and the radical Anabaptists denied any real presence, treating Communion purely as a communal prayer. Thus "mystery" was deflated: nothing in the elements itself was magically efficacious, only faith made them meaningful.

On the one hand, this might look like demystification. Protestant theology insisted on rational grounds: sacraments work when attended by true faith, not by any mystical power in the rite itself. Baptism, for example, was redefined as a sign of a covenant already bestowed by God, not as a merit-conferring act. In Protestant confessions, clergy are sharply demoted: there is no sacramental priesthood interposing between believer and God. Even Mary and the saints were largely excised from public worship (no more Corpus Christi or All Saints parades). What Foucault calls the "pastoral" function moved from confession to sermon and from the confessional stall to the bedroom: each believer's conscience became the locus of spiritual accountability.

On the other hand, Protestants redirected what had been "sacred power" into the Bible and the church as institution. With papal authority gone, scripture (and its interpretation by magisterial churches) became the ultimate arbiter of truth. One might say the church became its own miracle: words on a page, universally accessible, now held a quasi-cosmic primacy. Rather than relics or icons, Protestants prized the printed Word. Calvin's Geneva even instituted a sort of "church discipline" with courts enforcing Sunday worship and Biblical ethics – a new metaphysical order built on biblical time. In effect, sacraments were replaced by proclamation. Saving grace did not cease to exist; it was reimagined as fully present in the Word made flesh, accessible to all believers in community. This reconfiguration signaled a redirection of spiritual power: from altars to pulpits, from ritual mystery to doctrinal certainty.

Talal Asad's critique is instructive here: he argues that modern "religion" is constructed as a system of belief separated from everyday life and politics. The Reformation laid the groundwork for this by tying salvation to assent to creedal propositions (e.g. justification by faith) rather than to participation in the medieval cultic order. In other words, Protestantism helped produce the idea that religion is essentially belief and conscience, not ritual practice. The Catholic sacramental universe, in which the spiritual was deeply woven into the fabric of communal life, largely collapsed into a more privatized inner piety.

## 5. Redefining "Faith" as an Inner State

Medieval Christianity had understood fides as an embodied habitus—a virtue formed by charity (fides formata caritate) and enacted through sacrament and community. Aquinas: "faith is formed by charity; charity makes faith perfect."

Early reformers reversed the vector:

- **Martin Luther** called faith "a living, daring confidence in God's grace, so sure and certain that a man could stake his life on it a thousand times." The "confidence" happens in the conscience; ritual can only preach or symbolize it.
- **John Calvin** tightened the definition: "Faith is a firm and certain knowledge of God's favor toward us, founded upon the truth of the freely given promise in Christ."

In both cases, knowledge-of-grace displaces participation-in-grace. Where Aquinas located faith in a sacramental ecology, Luther and Calvin locate it inside the judging subject—a decisive step toward the buffered self that Charles Taylor sees as the hallmark of secularity.

### Sola Fide and the Birth of Protestant Anxiety

Because salvation now rests on an invisible disposition, believers had to audit their own interior. Luther's vocabulary of Anfechtung (assaults of doubt) captures the mood: the Word "teaches you … to experience how right, how true, how sweet … God's Word is" only through struggle and anxiety.

By the 17th century Puritans were urged to keep spiritual "registers"—journals in which daily feelings were interrogated for evidence of grace:

*"Self-examination is the setting up a court in conscience and keeping a register there, that by strict scrutiny a man may know how things stand between God and his own soul." —Thomas Watson*

The result, as historian Stannard notes, was an "intense and unremitting fear of death" produced by God's inscrutable choice.

### Predestination and the Double Bind

Calvinist predestination intensified the loop: inward assurance is both sign of election and something no act of will can secure. Diaries, sermons, and tracts therefore teach believers to read every tremor of the heart as possible evidence—while warning that self-deception is omnipresent. John Bunyan's Grace Abounding swings between terror and relief, memorializing each doubt so that it can serve as later proof of deliverance.

The Calvinist must therefore believe sincerely and perform belief strategically—a proto-modern doublethink in which the self polices itself for the right affect.

### From Confessional Interior to Self-Surveillance

Michel Foucault supplies the genealogy:

*"He who is subjected to a field of visibility … inscribes in himself the power relation … he becomes the principle of his own subjection."*

The Protestant sermon replaces the Catholic confessional booth; but the logic is identical: the believer internalizes the gaze and turns it on the self continuously. Louis Althusser's axiom—"there is no ideology except by the subject and for the subject"—describes precisely this transition: faith becomes an ideological interpellation that calls "You!" and is answered in an inward voice.

## 6. Myth, Belief, Organization, Ritual: A Comparative Framework

We may schematize the Reformation's effect on the four dimensions of religion: myth (sacred narrative), belief (doctrinal content), organization (institutional structure), and ritual (symbolic practice):

**Myth**: Catholicism was rich in mythic narrative: creation stories, the lives of saints, martyr legends, the cosmic drama of Christ's death and sacrifice as "salvation history." Protestants did not invent new myths, but they recast or expelled the old ones. Biblical stories (e.g. the Exodus, Acts of the Apostles) were often read literally as "holy history" rather than allegory, but their interpretation became secularized (moral exemplars rather than mystical truths). Medieval myths like the intercession of saints, the cult of relics, or folk traditions (sprites, witches) were officially denounced as superstition. Jean-Luc Nancy would note that this fits a monotheistic legacy: monotheism demythologizes. As Nancy puts it, the Christian God "atheizes himself" by withdrawing from worldly story, ultimately signalling a world "without God". Thus Protestantism pressed myth out of the church into individualized belief or history.

**Belief**: Belief (doctrine) rose in prominence. The Reformers championed sola scriptura (Scripture alone) and sola fide (faith alone) – explicit propositional tenets about grace, election, and sacraments. Catechisms, confessions of faith, and theological debates proliferated. Intangible belief became the litmus of religious identity. Each Protestant denomination codified its creed (Lutherans, Calvinists, Anglicans, etc.), so that organized belief now defined community. Ironically, this doctrinal focus was the new mythic core for believers: the myths had gone, but a rational narrative (from the Fall to the Last Judgment) took their place as a "cognitive frame." Protestant preaching internalized biblical narrative into ethics (for example, Old Testament law became a moral story instead of a cosmic law imposed by a vicarious priesthood). The believer's experience became "inner" and belief-centered, satisfying Foucault's notion of the confessional – one now confessed faith and personal interpretation instead of penitent feeling.

**Organization**: Institutionally, Protestantism fragmented the monolithic medieval Church into many churches. Each prince or city could set up its own church (often with a state-appointed bishop or consistory). The pre-Reformation Church's universal hierarchy was replaced by national or local structures. In some cases (England, Scandinavia), monarchs became heads of church. In others (Geneva, some German cities), civic councils or synods ruled. Layered beneath these were further splits into sects and free churches (Anabaptists, Baptists, etc.) that often rejected state ties. Weber noted that Protestantism spawned a sect–church cycle: sects (voluntary, schismatic groups with strict disciplines) and churches (state churches with formal membership) alternated, institutionalizing diversity. By contrast, medieval religion had been more geographically uniform, tied to local parishes but conceptually universal. In effect, Protestantism exported the logic of institutional organization to the modern world: religion became one sphere of life with its own bureaucracies, comparable to the new secular state. This was a key step toward the modern category "organized religion" – discrete societies governed by creeds and offices, distinct from (though often allied with) political power.

**Ritual**: Protestant reformers drastically curtailed ritual. The medieval Mass, Marian devotions, fasts, pilgrimages, etc., were abolished or simplified. Only two sacraments remained (Baptism and the Lord's Supper), and these were stripped of Catholic magic. Ordinary believers now needed only a Bible and prayer, rather than rosaries or candles. Eucharistic ritual became brief and vernacular, preceded by sermons. As noted above, liturgy shifted toward "clarity" and community, suppressing mystery. In sum, ritual and mythic performance lost their former centrality. Protestants did not "expel" myth entirely (they still told Bible stories and sang psalms), but they relocated much that was once symbol into moral narrative and ethical life. Community solidarity relied more on schools, guilds, or nationhood than on religious fairs or processions. Sacramental grace, once a cosmic force, became an inner assurance.

Altogether, Protestantism can be seen as favoring belief and organization over ritual and myth. It replaced a communal, embodied religion with a more disembodied, textually-grounded one. One might say it tried to secularize myth by making it historical (literal Bible accounts) or ethical (the world as stage for God's moral teaching), rather than leaving it as immanent sacral saga. Nancy's insight about capitalism is relevant: he contends that both monotheism and capitalism "strip" social life of narratives and values. Protestantism's rational morality and market-friendly individualism anticipated that process, leaving religion itself as one value-sphere (of belief) among others.

## 7. Long-Term Effects: Privatized Belief and the Making of Secular Religion

The structural shift initiated by Protestant reform paved the way for the modern concept of religion as chiefly private belief. In the Protestant mold, religion became what one believes – doctrines on paper – rather than what one does in ritual. This idea underlies our contemporary categories: "organized religion," "belief system," "secular faith." As one recent scholar notes, the very notions of "religion" and "secularity" in today's liberal West are modeled on Enlightenment Protestant assumptions. He writes: "When the modern concept of religion took shape, it was in the context of Enlightenment Protestantism, which became the model for religion as such." In other words, to be "religious" came to mean having interior convictions and private conscience – exactly the Reformation's emphasis.

This shift had key implications:

**Privatization of Belief**: Protestant theology broke religion into personal faith. Each individual was encouraged to read the Bible and judge doctrine by conscience. The idea of a secular state could rest on the notion that religion is an optional, individual loyalty (as Jefferson and Madison later argued), not a corporate obligation. Indeed, the language of "religious liberty" – freedom of opinion in matters of faith – assumes religion is about inner assent. Talal Asad and others observe that modern human rights discourse redefines religion as "creedal" and "deeply held belief." This could hardly have emerged without Protestant influence; Catholics and Orthodox long defined religion in communal, sacramental terms (e.g. participation in the church, not mere belief).

**Separation of Church and State**: Confessional Europe in 1650 was still a world of established churches. But the Reformation's legacy is a slow shift toward disestablishment. The wars of religion taught that enforcing uniform ritual breeds unrest; thinkers like Locke (a Puritan) argued for toleration precisely because faith was seen as inward. By the 19th century, many states claimed neutrality toward church beliefs, creating a public/private divide. This "secular" political order assumes religion is just one sector. It was imaginable because reformers had first relegated rites to the domestic sphere and invoked an autonomous conscience.

**Organized Religion as Category**: The pluralism of Protestant sects itself established the norm of "organized religion" versus beliefs. Scholars of religion note that Protestant denominationalism provided the template for later religious identity groups everywhere. Even today, when sociologists study Buddhism or Islam, they often implicitly assume "believers" whose lives revolve around theology and moral commitments, a model inherited from Christianity. Nancy's and Taylor's work both remind us that our conceptual universe (religion, secularity, belief) emerged from a distinctly Western, Protestant-infused history.

**Secular Categories**: Finally, Protestant reforms seeded secular ideas. By exiling myth and ritual from public life, Protestant culture helped carve out a separate realm for "the world." Capital accumulation and statecraft (themselves fostered by Protestant ethics) became "secular" pursuits, distinct from "religious" redemption. Foucault's notion of governmentality – power over life – finds an ironic foreshadowing in the Reformation: Luther's teaching that princes govern God's people, and Calvin's theocratic city planning, were early forms of managing populations. The long-term result is a worldview where belief systems (like Christianity) coexist with other ideologies, none absolute.

## 8. From Anxious Believer to Neoliberal Subject

Foucault's Chicago-school lecture shows the arc: once the soul is taught to ask "Do I truly believe?" it can just as well ask "Am I maximising my human capital?" Neoliberal governmentality recodes conscience as permanent economic self-assessment—"entrepreneurs of themselves" rather than pilgrims toward grace.

The earlier Protestant schema supplied:
1. Interior criterion (faith → performance metrics)
2. Continuous self-examination (spiritual journal → data dashboard)  
3. Anxiety as proof of sincerity (Anfechtung → "hustle culture")

---

## 9. Conclusion: The Birth of Modern "Religion"

The Reformation's redefinition of faith—from sacramental habitus to psychological state—generated a new form of self-relating subjectivity. Its legacy runs from Puritan diaries to the modern "entrepreneur of the self." Understanding this arc is crucial for any critique of contemporary religiosity (including neo-pagan revivals): the field in which new myths are planted has already been ploughed by Protestant interiorization, anxiety, and the ideological demand to mean what we perform while performing what we must mean.

In sum, the Protestant Reformation initiated a genealogy of modern religion. By substituting inward faith for outward magic, and doctrine for sacrament, it laid the groundwork for the very idea of religion as we know it today – a private belief system organized into churches, separate from the secular state and stripped of the mythic depth that once animated medieval life.

**This Protestant template of "religion"** — belief-centered, organizationally distinct, individually chosen — becomes the framework that European colonizers will export globally, forcing all human spiritual practices into this Protestant-derived category.

## Theoretical Frameworks: Understanding Religion as a Modern Category

### Talal Asad's Genealogy of Religion
Talal Asad, an anthropologist, has been a leading voice arguing that "religion" is not a universally given phenomenon but a concept with a specific history. Drawing on Michel Foucault's idea of discourse, Asad in *Genealogies of Religion* (1993) and *Formations of the Secular* (2003) traces how what we call religion was reshaped in early modern Europe. He underscores that Protestantism played a key role: by redefining religion as inner belief rather than external ritual, and by aligning with emerging nation-states which wanted loyal but spiritually free subjects, Protestantism set the stage for the secular/religious binary. Asad notes that the concept was then exported via colonialism, and that Western scholars (like 19th-century anthropologists) then constructed definitions of religion that often mirrored Protestant Christianity (focus on scripture, doctrine, etc.).

### Max Weber on Rationalization and Differentiation
Max Weber argued that Protestantism (especially Calvinism and sectarian Pietism) helped rationalize economic life (giving rise to capitalism) and also rationalized religious life itself – stripping away sacraments, saints, and communal festivals in favor of individual Bible reading, personal prayer, and moral discipline. This, in Weber's broader theory, is part of the differentiation of value spheres in modernity: the religious sphere becomes specialized (concerned only with personal salvation and ethics), while other spheres like economy, law, politics become autonomous and follow their own rationalities (profit, legality, power). Weber's concept of "social differentiation" dovetails with our argument: as society modernizes (beginning with the Reformation as a catalyst), institutions specialize and separate. Religion stops governing all aspects of life and instead focuses on the spiritual.

### Benedict Anderson and Print Capitalism
Benedict Anderson's work *Imagined Communities* (1983) touches on the Reformation's role in the rise of print-languages and new imagined identities. Anderson pointed out that the vernacular Bible translations and religious pamphlets of the Reformation were among the first widely circulated print media in Europe. This fractured the universal Latin Catholic world into distinct communities of faith. People began to recognize that what had been one Church was now many "religions" – a necessary step for conceiving religion as a category (one can only abstract "religion" once you see multiple examples of it; e.g. Christianity vs. Judaism vs. Islam came into sharper relief). Print capitalism also encouraged the spread of ideas of tolerance and pluralism through pamphlets and books by figures like Locke, Milton, and Bayle.

## Global Export of the Protestant "Religion" Concept through Colonialism

The story does not end in Europe or in the Enlightenment. A critical part of this chapter's argument is that the Protestant-defined concept of religion – as a distinct, private, belief-centered sphere – was exported and imposed globally via colonialism and missionary activity. The modern international order and cross-cultural encounters of the 18th–20th centuries spread this European notion of "religion" to peoples who often had very different worldviews.

### Colonial Administrative Categories
European colonial administrators, when governing foreign populations, felt a need to categorize their subjects – by race, ethnicity, caste, and religion – in order to make sense of and rule them. They often assumed that "religion" was a universal type of human institution, so they looked for something in each society that corresponded to the churches or sects they knew at home. A striking example is British India: the British arrived to find a bewildering diversity of temples, deities, sects, and philosophies in the subcontinent. Through the 19th century, they gradually classified most Indians as belonging to one of several "religions": primarily Hinduism, Islam, or Sikhism. In doing so, they invented the notion of a homogeneous "Hinduism." As one historical analysis notes, "British colonial administrators soon got to work officially classifying caste and religious identities. The consequence was that all those Indians who were not Muslim or Christian became 'Hindu' by default. In this regard, Hinduism's origins are radically modern."

### Missionary Enterprises
Protestant missionaries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas not only preached Christianity but also often actively reorganized local societies along the sacred/secular divide. They introduced church institutions (separated from the "world"), schools (often religiously based but teaching secular subjects too, implicitly distinguishing education from ritual), and the idea that converting to Christianity might require isolating "religious" beliefs from "cultural" practices. For example, when missionaries encountered, say, a Polynesian or African community, they might demand that converts abandon certain dances, costumes, or rites that the missionaries deemed pagan – effectively telling people those practices are not just different religion but perhaps not religion at all, just heathen culture to be discarded.

### Resistance and Adaptation
Colonized peoples reacted in varied ways. Often, they resisted the pressure to compartmentalize their lives. For instance, many Native Americans continued to perform ceremonies in secret when they were banned as "not religion." The native perspective was that dancing, vision quests, use of sacred herbs, etc., were part of the fabric of life given by the Creator – they did not separate them as "religious observances" distinct from culture or politics. The U.S. government, however, insisted on seeing these as religious choices that could be regulated or replaced by Christianity. Some indigenous leaders eventually adopted the Western discourse of religious freedom to argue for their rights – essentially saying, "These ceremonies are our religion and thus should be protected like your religion is." In doing so, they to some extent had to translate their holistic traditions into the Western category of "a religion."

## Scholarly Consensus: The Protestant Origins of Modern "Religion"

In the field of religious studies and history, there is broad agreement that the use of the term "religion" as a generic, comparativist concept emerges in the wake of the Reformation. The scholarly consensus, from Wilfred C. Smith in the 1960s to Talal Asad in the 1990s to more recent scholars, continues to reiterate this point. Political historians concur that the Peace of Westphalia and similar treaties were milestones in secularizing politics – essentially inventing a "secular constitution" where religion was cordoned off as private belief.

The overarching thesis holds: the modern global understanding of "religion" as a distinct category is overwhelmingly a result of European (especially Protestant) historical trajectories. Even if other cultures had spiritual pluralism or philosophical distinctions, none developed the exact institutional and conceptual separation that became normative worldwide. By the mid-20th century, virtually the entire world had been pulled into a discourse where "religion" is assumed to be a basic, distinct category of human life. As Asad succinctly writes, "religion as a historical category emerged in the West and has come to be applied as a universal concept."
