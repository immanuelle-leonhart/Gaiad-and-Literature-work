# Shinto cultural appropriation chapter

1. Cultural Appropriation and Shinto: Global Perspectives and Practices

## Official Shinto Positions on Non-Japanese Participation
Shinto authorities have explicitly addressed whether non-Japanese can take part in Shinto. The Association of Shinto Shrines (神社本庁 *Jinja Honchō*), which oversees about 80,000 shrines in Japan, emphasizes that Shinto is open to anyone who approaches it with respect. In its official English *Q&A*, Jinja Honchō makes clear there is **no formal conversion process** in Shinto – one does not “become” a Shintoist in the way one might formally convert to another religion​[^cite_1](^cite_1). Instead, *“Shinto is something that you do, rather than something that you are,”* and it is fully compatible with simultaneously adhering to other faiths or none[^cite_2](^cite_2)
. Some key points from Jinja Honchō and other Shinto institutions include:

- **Open Access to Shrines:** There are no restrictions barring outsiders from shrine grounds. Shrines (*jinja*) are considered public, communal spaces open to everyone, regardless of religious background​[^cite_3](^cite_3)[^cite_4](^cite_4)Visitors of any faith may enter and worship, provided they behave respectfully and maintain the dignity of the sacred space[^cite_5](^cite_5). In Jinja Honchō’s words, *“all jinja are public in the sense that they are open to everyone”*[^cite_6](^cite_6). Non-Shinto or non-Japanese guests are welcomed to participate in rituals (such as the bowing and clapping prayer etiquette) as long as it is done sincerely and politely.
- **No Concept of Conversion or Exclusivity:** Shinto has no baptism or confession of faith to mark “conversion.” Jinja Honchō explicitly states that *“you are welcome to practise Shinto, both by visiting jinja in Japan, and in personal practice at home”*, without any formal initiation[^cite_7](^cite_7)In fact, Shinto in Japan is often practiced alongside Buddhism; most Japanese do not identify exclusively as Shinto followers[^cite_8](^cite_8). This means a non-Japanese person can incorporate Shinto practices (such as honoring kami at a home altar or observing Shinto festivals) into their life even if they belong to another religion. Shinto institutions do not consider this cultural appropriation; they see it as a normal extension of Shinto’s non-exclusive nature.
- **Non-Japanese Shinto Priests:** It is even possible for foreigners to become Shinto priests (神職 *shinshoku*). Jinja Honchō notes that a *handful* of non-Japanese individuals have undergone the requisite training and been licensed as priests​[^cite_9](^cite_9)The training – typically a year or more of study in Japan, in Japanese – poses high practical hurdles, but there is no ethnic bar to ordination[^cite_10](^cite_10) In 2007, for example, an Austrian man named Florian Wiltschko became the first foreigner certified by Jinja Honchō as a Shinto priest, after rigorous training in Tokyo[^cite_11](^cite_11). Likewise, the Tsubaki Grand Shrine of America (in Washington state) has long been headed by a non-Japanese priest. These cases show that official Shinto organizations can accommodate non-Japanese practitioners even in clergy roles. The underlying stance is that **sincerity and proper training**, not ethnicity, are what qualify a person to serve the kami (deities).
- **Shinto Abroad:** Shinto shrines exist outside Japan in communities of the Japanese diaspora (e.g. in Hawai’i, Brazil, the mainland U.S., Europe, etc.), and they too fall under or cooperate with Jinja Honchō​[^cite_12](^cite_12) Historically, such shrines were founded to serve emigrant Japanese communities, but today they often welcome local participants of diverse backgrounds. Jinja Honchō officially recognizes some overseas shrines (for instance, a shrine in San Marino in Europe)[^cite_13](^cite_13). This international presence implies an acceptance that **local, non-Japanese worshippers** may venerate the kami. In summary, the official policy of Shinto authorities is inclusive: anyone may visit shrines and honor the kami, and one can practice Shinto rituals without being ethnically Japanese. Rather than viewing this as misappropriation, Shinto leaders encourage *respectful* participation. They do, however, expect outsiders to **observe proper decorum** (e.g. bowing, purity rituals) as a sign of respect toward Shinto traditions[^cite_14](^cite_14)

## Shinto in a Global Context: Scholarship on Globalization, Nationalism, and Spiritual Tourism
Academic researchers have been studying the globalization of Shinto and the complexities that arise when a tradition so rooted in Japanese culture spreads to non-Japanese contexts. A key question is how Shinto – often seen as the “indigenous religion” of Japan – transforms when people outside Japan adopt its practices. Scholars of religion have noted both **opportunities** and **tensions** in this process, often discussing cultural appropriation, nationalism, and the role of tourism and pop culture in popularizing Shinto abroad.

**Motivations for Non-Japanese Adopting Shinto:** Recent research by Kaitlyn Ugoretz, who conducts digital ethnography of online Shinto communities, identifies several common “paths” by which non-Japanese become interested in Shinto[^cite_15](^cite_15)[^cite_16](^cite_16)
