# Chapter 11: Protestant Reformation & the Birth of Modern "Religion"

*[NEEDS WRITING - HIGH PRIORITY]*

## Chapter Outline
- **Key transition**: "Now let's see how Perry became Commodore Perry" 
- **Anachronistic jump back**: Medieval Europe → Protestant Reformation
- Luther/Calvin → belief-centrism, emotional blackmail elements
- European wars of religion → codifying "religion" concept
- Treaty of Westphalia and religious categorization

## Research Available
- Check notes_notes2.md for Protestant Reformation material
- Need primary Luther/Calvin sources
- Treaty of Westphalia documentation

*This is where your central thesis begins - the birth of belief-centric "religion"*
