# Section L

## Section Lambda: The Modern Age of Religion and Disenchantment

The previous section traced the origins of god-worshipping across six major historical formations: Egypt, Israel, Persia, Rome, China, and Japan. Each of these traditions began with acts of recognition, ritual development, and mythic codification—what I earlier described as the coding of god-worship. But across all of them, a process of despotic overcoding occurred. These rich traditions were subsumed into imperial power: temples became fiscal centers, prophets were co-opted, and the gods became tools of centralized rule. 

This section now begins the story of the last 500 years: a story of *decoding*. It is the story of religion in the modern sense. Of Protestantism. Of colonization. Of privatization. Of disenchantment. And ultimately, of neoliberal spectacle.

I will now begin to use the term *religion* much more freely. In the previous section, I avoided it as a colonial concept—anachronistically imposed onto systems that never saw themselves as belonging to a category called "religion." But in the modern age, religion becomes a thing in itself. It becomes visible, portable, and exportable. It becomes a commodity, a weapon, a passport stamp.

And yet, god-worshipping persists. But it is not left unchanged.

What I want to argue here is that the privatization of god-worship—the liberalization of religion—has ultimately served *capital* more than it has served any specific god. The shift from public ritual to private belief did not happen by accident. It was designed. And it is precisely this shift that allowed capital to flourish: by ensuring that meaning would never again interfere with markets.

Evangelicalism is the ultimate yassification of religion. It presents itself as a return to purity, a revival of tradition—but it is nothing of the sort. It is emotionally intense but structurally hollow. Ritually shallow but rhetorically powerful. It claims to be anti-modern, but in practice it is the most compatible form of worship with market capitalism. 

Evangelicalism is:
- A privatized system of belief with no lineage, no ancestry, no land.
- A structure of emotional manipulation easily livestreamed, branded, and monetized.
- A hyperdecoded performance of submission to authority, masquerading as personal empowerment.

Earlier stages of capital could afford to simply *decode* god-worship—to render it meaningless, to leave behind a population of secular workers. But now, as birthrates collapse and labor dwindles, capital must turn back to religion. It needs obedience. It needs growth. It needs a new despotism, disguised in pop aesthetics. And so Evangelicalism becomes the ideal vehicle. Fertility cult masked as Jesus. Church-as-franchise. Worship as algorithmic spectacle.

Japan attempted to resist this through the public elevation of Shinto. The Department of Divinities (神祇官, *jingi-kan*) system preserved a degree of public ritual infrastructure well into modernity. But State Shinto was not a victory of the gods—it was their bureaucratic taxidermy. Shinto survived institutionally, but its lifeblood was drained for the sake of imperial overcoding.

In this section, we will explore the slow motion collapse of public god-worship and the rise of religion as a privatized aesthetic product. But we will also see its limits. The gods, even when trapped in memes, yearn to break free. And this is where we may find hope for their return.
## Section Lambda: Codes, Despots, and the Modern Collapse

In this section, we move from the cosmogonic depths of god-worship's origins (Section Alpha) into the entangled social world that shapes and reshapes god-worship under historical pressure. This is Section Lambda, named for the symbolic middle—the link between origin and culmination. Here we trace how ritual codes become social structures, how those structures are overcoded by despotic regimes, and how capitalist modernity ultimately seeks to decode everything into abstract units of value.

Let us begin with a basic premise: every god-worshipping tradition exists not only as a spiritual practice, but as a social form. Its rituals, symbols, myths, and cults are embedded in the material life of a society. These are not just beliefs—they are codes. And those codes emerge from the practices of people embedded in specific lifeworlds. They are generated from experience, from repetition, from relevance realization. But these codes are not stable. They are vulnerable to capture.

What Deleuze and Guattari call **despotic overcoding** is what happens when a dominant power subsumes the codes of a people under its own semiotic regime. The blacksmiths of the Dogon did not simply preserve a sacred tradition—they created sacredness out of technical knowledge. But when overcoding appears, the power of kings, priests, or bureaucracies rewrites meaning from the top down. The forge becomes subordinate to a cosmology imposed by decree.

This is how religion became what it is in the modern West: a privatized, hollowed category. In the six case studies from Section Alpha, we will see despotic overcoding at work: in the pharaoh’s suppression of Atenism, in the priestly restructuring of Israelite cult, in Zoroaster’s collusion with imperial Persia, in the Roman imperial cult, in Chinese imperial ritual formalism, and in Meiji Japan’s codification of kami.

But Section Lambda is not about those original despotisms. It is about the **transition into modernity**, when the despotic overcoding of local god-worship is no longer enough. Capitalism does not want to overwrite local codes. It wants to **decode** them—to strip them of symbolic meaning entirely. Where despotism rewrites, capitalism erases.

In the past, a cow might be sacred, or tied to a dowry, or linked to ancestral prestige. In capitalism, a cow is a unit of exchange, reducible to its dollar value. Ritual, kinship, sacrifice—these are inefficient. What matters is the number. The exchange.

This decoding process is not passive. It requires and reproduces systems of domination. As symbolic codes break down, the social functions they once performed are maintained by brute force. In the American context, the privatization of religion, the erosion of kinship ties, and the rise of evangelicalism are not contradictions but symptoms. Evangelicalism is **yassified religion**—stripped of historical depth, engineered for compliance, staged for emotional impact. It cooperates with capital because it was made in its image.

Japan tried to resist this. Through the Jingikan and the State Shinto system, it attempted to **recode** its native god-worship within the framework of a modern nation. But it failed. State Shinto was not a triumph of kami—it was a triumph of Meiji bureaucracy. Shinto survived, but the form it took was bureaucratically flattened. Its gods were conscripted into nationalist myth. Even resistance became instrumental.

We are now at the crisis point. Capitalism, having decoded religion and kinship, now turns its attention to **desire itself**. Dating apps, marketing algorithms, and neuro-optimization tools all convert yearning into quantifiable flows. We no longer worship gods. We match, optimize, consume. We are told this is freedom. But it is a cage with no bars.

The collapse of social codes has not led to liberation, but to **raw domination**—a society governed not by gods or even by laws, but by efficiency calculations backed by coercive force. The spiritual exhaustion of the West is not accidental. It is the end result of centuries of overcoding followed by total decoding.

Yet from this collapse, something new may emerge. In the gaps left by broken codes, **god-worship** can return—not as nostalgia, but as insurgency. A practice of love, of relation, of sacred recomposition. The codes are not dead. They have only been covered in white paint, thin enough to still see the lines beneath.

Let this section be the bridge. From the gods of old, to the ruins of modernity, and toward the sacred again.

We begin.
